Video Description: A Nasa-SpaceX mission that aimed to clear the way for two "stranded" astronauts to get back to Earth has been postponed.
 
The rocket aimed to fly four new crew members to the International Space Station (ISS) and pave the way for the return of Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore.
 
The two Nasa astronauts flew to space in June 2024 but were not able to return on a Boeing spacecraft after it was deemed unsafe.

# SpaceX launch to help stranded astronauts home postponed | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKMDNDCalvk)
*  An attempt to send replacement crew to the International Space Station to relieve two [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKMDNDCalvk&t=0.0s)]
*  US astronauts who have been stranded there since June has been postponed. An issue with [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKMDNDCalvk&t=5.04s)]
*  the launch pad prompted officials at Cape Canaveral in Florida to cancel the SpaceX flight [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKMDNDCalvk&t=10.48s)]
*  only minutes before it was due to blast off. Butch Wilmore and Sunny Williams arrived at the ISS for [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKMDNDCalvk&t=15.6s)]
*  an eight-day mission in the summer but were unable to return after their spacecraft developed problems. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKMDNDCalvk&t=21.68s)]
*  Across all of this is our science editor Rebecca Morrell. What happened with this launch that was [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKMDNDCalvk&t=27.84s)]
*  meant to go up to bring them down? It has been a bit of a saga but it's not that unusual for rockets [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKMDNDCalvk&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  to be delayed and it wasn't actually a problem with the rocket, it was a problem with the ground [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKMDNDCalvk&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  based system that launches the rocket. The launch was delayed, the NASA officials took the decision [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKMDNDCalvk&t=42.800000000000004s)]
*  to do that and it now looks like it's probably going to be Friday, late in the evening UK time [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKMDNDCalvk&t=49.44s)]
*  when it goes up. But as you say Butch and Sunny, you know they were supposed to be on there for [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKMDNDCalvk&t=54.88s)]
*  just over a week and they've been there for more than nine months already but actually a few more [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKMDNDCalvk&t=59.440000000000005s)]
*  days isn't going to make much difference and once the rocket, while it's important, it's actually [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKMDNDCalvk&t=64.0s)]
*  carrying the replacement crew for Butch and Sunny. So when the astronauts, the four astronauts who [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKMDNDCalvk&t=68.0s)]
*  are going to eventually go up, when they finally do arrive there'll be a brief handover and then [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKMDNDCalvk&t=73.2s)]
*  Butch and Sunny can come home, they can return to Earth and that'll probably be on Wednesday if [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKMDNDCalvk&t=77.6s)]
*  it goes up on Friday but so many ifs, it's a moveable feast. Well it's complicated isn't it [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKMDNDCalvk&t=82.48s)]
*  and that's the understatement of the century. We talk about them, these two being stranded. Now I [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKMDNDCalvk&t=89.44s)]
*  remember when they first went up and were meant to come back but didn't, someone said to me, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKMDNDCalvk&t=95.36s)]
*  look don't describe them as being stranded, these are highly trained, they know the risks [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKMDNDCalvk&t=100.88000000000001s)]
*  and so stranded is arguably totally the wrong word to use. Yeah I mean I think it's because [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKMDNDCalvk&t=106.0s)]
*  stranded implies they've got no way of getting home and that actually isn't the case because the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKMDNDCalvk&t=111.36s)]
*  way the space station works, the spacecraft that sort of travel to the space station then come back [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKMDNDCalvk&t=117.36s)]
*  again, they actually stay parked on the space station so it always means that there's essentially [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKMDNDCalvk&t=122.16s)]
*  a lifeboat to carry astronauts back to Earth should they ever need to come back to Earth in [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKMDNDCalvk&t=127.75999999999999s)]
*  an emergency for example. It's just that NASA took the decision, so I mean there is a bit of backstory [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKMDNDCalvk&t=132.64s)]
*  to this but basically the spacecraft that Butch and Sunny travelled to the International Space [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKMDNDCalvk&t=138.48s)]
*  Station on, it was a prototype spacecraft, it developed problems, NASA decided it wasn't safe [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKMDNDCalvk&t=142.72s)]
*  enough to bring them back so it came back to Earth empty, that left them without a ride home. So NASA's [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKMDNDCalvk&t=147.28s)]
*  decision was to incorporate them into the next scheduled flight, that flight arrived in September, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKMDNDCalvk&t=153.6s)]
*  it's actually been attached, the spacecraft, the SpaceX spacecraft has been attached to the space [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKMDNDCalvk&t=159.51999999999998s)]
*  station since September but what they decided to do was to incorporate Butch and Sunny into that [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKMDNDCalvk&t=163.6s)]
*  mission because that spacecraft was always going to stay docked until now for the return home so [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKMDNDCalvk&t=169.44s)]
*  it's slightly complicated and what they're waiting for now is a replacement crew so they can come [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKMDNDCalvk&t=174.72s)]
*  home. So actually their lift home has been attached to the space station since September, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKMDNDCalvk&t=179.84s)]
*  it's just the crew exchange isn't happening until now. There's a lot of complicated scheduling on [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKMDNDCalvk&t=183.76s)]
*  the space station, it's done years in advance so actually having two extra people there [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKMDNDCalvk&t=187.92s)]
*  takes a lot of rejigging. God and just like again understatement of the year, it's complicated but [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKMDNDCalvk&t=193.52s)]
*  it's like when you your crew and when you get a flight they've overworked their hours and they [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKMDNDCalvk&t=198.24s)]
*  can't then fly again. Rebecca as always thank you very much for bringing that to us and hopefully [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKMDNDCalvk&t=203.04000000000002s)]
*  when that, swap over, when that launch does happen you'll be back for more on that. Rebecca [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKMDNDCalvk&t=208.48000000000002s)]
*  Rael our science editor, thank you so much. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKMDNDCalvk&t=212.64000000000001s)]
