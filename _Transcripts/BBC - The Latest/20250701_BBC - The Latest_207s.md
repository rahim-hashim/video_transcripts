Video Description: Sudan has been wracked by a civil war since fighting broke out between the army and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in April 2023.
 
The conflict has caused one of the world's worst humanitarian crises with more than 12 million people forced to flee their homes.
 
Darfur has been one of the areas worst-hit by the fighting and the RSF control most of the region - except for the city of el-Fasher that has remained in the hands of the army and its allies.
 
El-Fasher has come under intense bombardment as the RSF attempts to seize it. 
 
In April it announced plans to form a government to rival the one established by the army, and has raised fears that it could lead to Sudan's partition.
