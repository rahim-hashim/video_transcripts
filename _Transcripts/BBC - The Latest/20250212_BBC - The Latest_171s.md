Video Description: A discovery underneath the basement of an office block has been described as one of the most important pieces of Roman history unearthed in the city of London.
 
Archaeologists have found a substantial piece of the ancient city's first basilica - a 2,000 year old public building where major political, economic and administrative decisions were made.
 
The excavation has so far revealed sections of stone wall that formed the base of the basilica, which would have been two-and-half storeys high.
 
The site, which will eventually be opened to the public, sheds light on the city's beginnings.

*  It's a thriving modern city. London's square mile is packed with skyscrapers. But a rich [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k-RPwLWW3o&t=0.0s)]
*  history lies beneath its streets. Now a new discovery goes back to the city's very beginnings [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k-RPwLWW3o&t=8.16s)]
*  and it's in the basement of this building. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k-RPwLWW3o&t=13.88s)]
*  If you come this way. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k-RPwLWW3o&t=16.36s)]
*  I mean you can see this is definitely an office building filing cabinets. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k-RPwLWW3o&t=17.84s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k-RPwLWW3o&t=21.36s)]
*  But here it is. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k-RPwLWW3o&t=22.36s)]
*  It's the wall of the first Roman basilica. It's absolutely amazing. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k-RPwLWW3o&t=23.36s)]
*  This is part of an important public building located in a large Roman forum dating to [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k-RPwLWW3o&t=27.06s)]
*  around 80 AD. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k-RPwLWW3o&t=32.14s)]
*  This is Countish Ragstone. This was a building that was 40 metres long, 20 metres wide. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k-RPwLWW3o&t=34.0s)]
*  It was probably two and a half storeys high. It was a huge, huge Roman building and it [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k-RPwLWW3o&t=38.62s)]
*  was designed to impress. It's a statement of their commitment to London and possibly [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k-RPwLWW3o&t=42.22s)]
*  reflects a change in the status of London and possibly even the fact that London is [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k-RPwLWW3o&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  becoming the capital of Britain. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k-RPwLWW3o&t=49.06s)]
*  Other artefacts have been unearthed here too. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k-RPwLWW3o&t=51.019999999999996s)]
*  This for example is a nice bit of tile and you can just see it's got a stamp on there [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k-RPwLWW3o&t=53.46s)]
*  and that's the stamp of the procurator of London. It's got these finger marks where [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k-RPwLWW3o&t=58.660000000000004s)]
*  the tile maker would have swept their fingers around like that. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k-RPwLWW3o&t=62.74s)]
*  This is Guildhall Yard which is the centre of the modern city and close to here was the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k-RPwLWW3o&t=65.66s)]
*  Roman Basilica and Forum. Two thousand years ago it would have been the beating heart of [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k-RPwLWW3o&t=70.66s)]
*  ancient London. It would have been a thriving place with shops, offices and a bustling market. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k-RPwLWW3o&t=76.84s)]
*  And in this building here was where all of the major political and administrative decisions [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k-RPwLWW3o&t=83.7s)]
*  were made. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k-RPwLWW3o&t=88.30000000000001s)]
*  This is just the start of the dig. There's more Basilica to be unearthed. The building [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k-RPwLWW3o&t=91.30000000000001s)]
*  it's under is about to be redeveloped and the discovery has meant a redesign so the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k-RPwLWW3o&t=95.94000000000001s)]
*  site can be opened to the public. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k-RPwLWW3o&t=100.46000000000001s)]
*  The scheme has been comprehensively adjusted. The columns have had to literally move position [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k-RPwLWW3o&t=102.86000000000001s)]
*  so you're not destroying these special stones that we found in the ground. To actually see [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k-RPwLWW3o&t=107.84s)]
*  people using and enjoying the space moving through the public hall and down into to see [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k-RPwLWW3o&t=112.0s)]
*  the remains will be absolutely incredible. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k-RPwLWW3o&t=118.64s)]
*  Pockets of Roman London can be found all over the city like here at the Temple of Mithras [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k-RPwLWW3o&t=123.44s)]
*  which uses technology to bring the archaeology to life. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k-RPwLWW3o&t=130.04s)]
*  The fact that Roman London is beneath your feet is frankly quite a remarkable emotion [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k-RPwLWW3o&t=134.68s)]
*  to experience. You can actually see and visualise how it would have been, how Roman London would [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k-RPwLWW3o&t=140.04000000000002s)]
*  have been in those times and then you can walk outside and you can say now look at the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k-RPwLWW3o&t=146.24s)]
*  skyscrapers. This is progress but at the same time progress combined with preservation. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k-RPwLWW3o&t=151.24s)]
*  This unique history has shaped what London is today and now that history is being rediscovered [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k-RPwLWW3o&t=157.98000000000002s)]
*  giving the city's past a bright future. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k-RPwLWW3o&t=163.92000000000002s)]
