# China launches military drills in waters around Taiwan | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [April 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxQpaFasvok)
*  China has launched large-scale military drills in the waters around Taiwan to deter the self-governing island from seeking independence. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxQpaFasvok&t=0.0s)]
*  A spokesperson for the Chinese army said the joint army, navy and rocket force exercises should act as a stern warning. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxQpaFasvok&t=8.0s)]
*  Taiwan has sent warships to respond to China's navy vessels approaching its coast. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxQpaFasvok&t=15.0s)]
*  Over the weekend, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth visited Japan and announced an upgrade to US military forces there [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxQpaFasvok&t=20.0s)]
*  because of China's perceived threat to Taiwan. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxQpaFasvok&t=27.0s)]
*  Let's speak to our China correspondent Stephen McDonnell and Steve Ver, this drill specifically targeting and focusing on Taiwan. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxQpaFasvok&t=30.0s)]
*  Clearly aimed at encircling and potentially blockading Taiwan. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxQpaFasvok&t=42.0s)]
*  The Chinese government, it's believed, has put this plan together as a sort of first step prior to a potential full-scale invasion of Taiwan. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxQpaFasvok&t=48.0s)]
*  I guess they think that's better than a bloody invasion and yet it would be an act of war if this was ever to really come about. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxQpaFasvok&t=59.0s)]
*  The PLA today, the Eastern Theatre Command, has even said this is practice for closing in on Taiwan from all directions. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxQpaFasvok&t=66.0s)]
*  And when you look at the maps that are given out you can see where all the ships are placed all around the island, or the island group rather. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxQpaFasvok&t=75.0s)]
*  And what this involves, this latest exercise, at least 19 ships apparently, including the entire Shandong aircraft carrier battle group, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxQpaFasvok&t=81.0s)]
*  air force soldiers, navy and the rocket force. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxQpaFasvok&t=91.0s)]
*  And in response, Taiwan's own military, they've scrambled their own jets, they've put their own land-based missile systems on alert. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxQpaFasvok&t=97.0s)]
*  And we're seeing this more and more. Every year these exercises are coming more frequently and they're becoming larger in what appears to be an attempt by Beijing [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxQpaFasvok&t=104.0s)]
*  to try and put more pressure on this democratically governed island group to accept annexation from mainland China, something most Taiwanese people do not want to do. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxQpaFasvok&t=113.0s)]
*  And Steve, I suppose that while much of the world continues to focus on Ukraine, this is a reminder from China of its claim on Taiwan, which is still a very active issue. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxQpaFasvok&t=125.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's always been a bit of a fear that with the war in Ukraine and especially with certain perceptions that Donald Trump might be softer in his response, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxQpaFasvok&t=136.0s)]
*  that this could be a window for mainland China, for Beijing to grab Taiwan by force. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxQpaFasvok&t=148.0s)]
*  You know, I think we are away off that though. However, as I say, every year these war games are becoming greater and greater. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxQpaFasvok&t=156.0s)]
*  This time around, in one of the more bizarre things also, the PLA has released this propaganda material, videos, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxQpaFasvok&t=165.0s)]
*  showing the Monkey King from the Journey to the West story, video game character appearing alongside sort of jets attacking Taiwan. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxQpaFasvok&t=173.0s)]
*  I suppose it's an attempt to try and get the young crew on board, the cool kids, hey, get on board with the invasion of Taiwan. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxQpaFasvok&t=184.0s)]
*  But people here are sort of laughing about it. I mean, they're also portraying Lai Qingde, Taiwan's leader as a sort of insect being barbecued over a hot fire [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxQpaFasvok&t=191.0s)]
*  at the same time as showing these images of attacking the country. And it's interesting, you know, is this sort of downplaying the seriousness of an invasion, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxQpaFasvok&t=201.0s)]
*  attempting to get people used to it, attempting to get young people on board? It's sort of not clear. But this has all happened at the same time. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxQpaFasvok&t=211.0s)]
*  They've kicked off the preparations for a sort of mock surrounding of Taiwan. At the same time, there's this propaganda material coming out. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxQpaFasvok&t=219.0s)]
*  Yeah, and we're seeing more and more of this. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxQpaFasvok&t=228.0s)]
*  Steve, thanks very much. Stephen MacDonald in Beijing. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxQpaFasvok&t=232.0s)]
