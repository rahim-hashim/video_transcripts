Video Description: Hamas has rejected the latest Israeli proposal for the release of hostages and a ceasefire.
 
Instead, the group is reaffirming its commitment to an alternative, put forward by Egypt and Qatar.
 
The mediated plan proposed a 50 day ceasefire and a step-by-step process for exchanging Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, and in the absence of any agreement, bombardment will continue.
 
This afternoon, thick black smoke was seen from the southern Gaza Strip along with the sound of muffled explosions.
 
The Israelis said they are establishing a new security corridor which will separate Rafah from Khan Younis, giving Israel control of a second access in southern Gaza.
