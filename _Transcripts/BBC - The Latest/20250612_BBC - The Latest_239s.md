Video Description: The new group backed by Israel and the US for aid distribution in Gaza says Hamas attacked a bus transporting some of its Palestinian workers, killing at least five people.
 
The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation said the attack happened on Wednesday night as the bus carrying more than two-dozen workers travelled to a distribution centre in southern Gaza, and that it came after days of threats from Hamas.
 
The BBC cannot independently verify the statement, and Hamas has not commented but it previously denied it had threatened the foundation's staff.

**BBC - The Latest:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk)
*  The Israeli and US backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has accused Hamas of killing at [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=0.0s)]
*  least five people in an attack on a bus transporting Palestinians working for the organisation. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=5.72s)]
*  The BBC can't independently verify this statement by the group, which was set up earlier this [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=11.8s)]
*  year, and bypasses established UN humanitarian operations. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=16.2s)]
*  It comes as local medical staff say dozens more Palestinians were killed or injured by [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=20.96s)]
*  soldiers on Wednesday as they tried to access food at a GHF distribution centre. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=25.96s)]
*  Middle East correspondent Hugo Bishage gave us the latest update from... [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  There was a statement from the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation saying that this attack happened [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=36.52s)]
*  late last night on a bus carrying two dozen Palestinian workers who have been working [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=41.08s)]
*  with the organisation and it said this attack was carried out by Hamas. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=47.6s)]
*  It followed days of threats from Hamas. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=53.16s)]
*  We can't independently verify these details. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=57.559999999999995s)]
*  Israel hasn't allowed international news organisations, including the BBC, to enter Gaza and to report [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=61.36s)]
*  independently from inside Gaza. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=67.24s)]
*  But obviously this is this controversial new mechanism backed by Israel and the US that [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=69.6s)]
*  bypasses the United Nations and aid organisations for the distribution of humanitarian aid in [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=75.64s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=81.8s)]
*  It started operations two weeks ago and almost every day there have been deadly shootings [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=83.44s)]
*  around its hubs. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=88.6s)]
*  It's a mechanism that has been described as insufficient because a very limited number [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=90.32s)]
*  of people are being given a very limited amount of supplies in those hubs and also as inhumane [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=96.12s)]
*  because it requires people to travel to these crowded distribution centres at great personal [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=102.64s)]
*  risk. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=108.88s)]
*  The United Nations has refused to cooperate with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation and [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=109.96s)]
*  according to health officials in Gaza, more than 160 Palestinians have been killed trying [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=114.0s)]
*  to get aid from this mechanism. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=119.88s)]
*  Meanwhile, tell us about what Israel is saying regarding hostages. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=123.28s)]
*  Yes, so also late last night we had a statement from the Israeli military saying that it had [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=129.0s)]
*  recovered the bodies of two hostages who had been taken into Gaza during the Hamas attacks [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=135.12s)]
*  on the 7th of October. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=142.64s)]
*  One of them is Iaeed Yaakov, he was killed, then abducted from Kibbutz near Oz, he was [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=144.4s)]
*  59. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=150.36s)]
*  The military also said that his partner and two of his children had also been abducted [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=151.96s)]
*  during the attacks. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=157.72s)]
*  They were then released and the name of the second hostage hasn't been released. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=159.60000000000002s)]
*  Now 53 people who were abducted during the Hamas attacks remain in captivity in Gaza, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=165.4s)]
*  only 20 of them are believed to remain alive and many of the families of the hostages are [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=173.20000000000002s)]
*  saying that time is running out to save these people who remain alive. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=178.60000000000002s)]
*  We have seen that there have been very difficult negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=184.12s)]
*  release deal between Israel and Hamas. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=188.68s)]
*  In the last few days there have been reports of some progress in these negotiations. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=190.76000000000002s)]
*  Many of the families of the hostages have accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=196.16s)]
*  of not being interested in striking a deal with Hamas, of prolonging the war in Gaza [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=200.12s)]
*  for political purposes. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=205.96s)]
*  And again, they've been warning that time is running out to save those hostages who [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=207.76000000000002s)]
*  remain alive in Gaza. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=211.36s)]
*  Hugo Pacheca. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=214.04000000000002s)]
*  Well Hugo has just sent an update in the last few minutes saying that there have been further [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=214.96s)]
*  incidents and casualties surrounding how aid is being distributed in Gaza. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=220.4s)]
*  As he just explained, he said that health officials in Gaza say at least 18 Palestinians [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=225.36s)]
*  have been killed overnight and about 200 other people have injured while they were waiting [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=229.64000000000001s)]
*  for aid in the centre of the Strip. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRIJqM5Bjsk&t=235.72s)]
