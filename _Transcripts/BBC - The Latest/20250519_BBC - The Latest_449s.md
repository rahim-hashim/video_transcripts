Video Description: The UK and the EU have reached a new deal setting out post-Brexit relations on areas including fishing rights, trade and defence.
 
It marks the biggest reboot since the UK officially left the EU in 2020 and comes after years of disagreements over Brexit.
 
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer described it as a "landmark" deal, marking a "new era" in relations.
 
The Conservatives described the deal as a "surrender" to the EU, while the Liberal Democrats said the government had taken some "positive first steps" to rebuilding ties with Europe.

*  Here in London, Sarkis Dahmer has said that Britain is back on the world stage as he unveiled [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=0.0s)]
*  a new deal with the EU alongside senior European officials at a summit. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=5.04s)]
*  The agreement, aimed at resetting relations with EU after Brexit, was hailed by the head [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=10.02s)]
*  of the European Council as a new chapter. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=15.58s)]
*  Antonio Costa also describing the UK and the EU as neighbours, allies, partners and friends. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=18.02s)]
*  While European Commission President Oslo von der Leyen said today's agreement sent out [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=24.54s)]
*  a message to the world that in Europe, we stick together. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=28.92s)]
*  Let's take a look at what this agreement includes. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=32.0s)]
*  There's a 12-year deal around fishing access for EU boats in UK waters. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=34.84s)]
*  Confirmation there will be no increase in the amount of fish that EU vessels can catch. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=40.6s)]
*  Some routine checks on animal and plant food products will be removed completely. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=46.52s)]
*  That will allow goods to flow freely again, including between Great Britain and Northern [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  Ireland. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=55.160000000000004s)]
*  British tourists will be able to use more passport e-gates in Europe as well. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=56.199999999999996s)]
*  And also agreement to cooperate further on a youth experience scheme that could see young [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=60.919999999999995s)]
*  people able to work and travel freely in Europe once again. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=65.6s)]
*  There will also be a new security and defence partnership. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=69.32s)]
*  Watching it all unfold today from central London, where the summit has been held, is [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=73.4s)]
*  my colleague, Regina Vajinathan. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=77.8s)]
*  Regina. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=79.72s)]
*  The proceedings now have wrapped up, here at Lancaster House in central London. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=81.72s)]
*  But make no mistake, whether you are pro or anti-Brexit today, has been a [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=87.32s)]
*  symbolic and an historic one. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=91.44s)]
*  A number of deals, as you outlined there, that have been signed between [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=93.92s)]
*  the EU and the UK. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=97.4s)]
*  And Sikir Starmer in a news conference taking questions afterwards, he was [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=99.92s)]
*  asked, is this backsliding away from Brexit, that kind of thing? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=104.16s)]
*  He said, no, this is all about moving forward. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=107.8s)]
*  He used language that was in some ways repetitive but sending a similar [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=110.88s)]
*  message out. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=114.92s)]
*  He said, we are moving forward, not backwards. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=115.92s)]
*  He said, this is a new era. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=118.52s)]
*  This is turning a page. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  Most of all, he said that Britain was back on the world stage, highlighting [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=121.64s)]
*  the fact, of course, that it has only been a few weeks since the UK signed [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  an agreement on trade with the US and, of course, before that, with India. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=130.28s)]
*  Despite some criticism from opposition parties, Sikir Starmer said [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=135.68s)]
*  this was a good agreement today for all sides. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=139.76000000000002s)]
*  Today we have struck this landmark deal with the EU, a new partnership [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=144.76000000000002s)]
*  between an independent Britain and our allies in Europe. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=150.12s)]
*  This is the first UK-EU summit. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=154.60000000000002s)]
*  It marks a new era in our relationship. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=158.52s)]
*  This deal is a win-win. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=163.68s)]
*  It delivers what the British public voted for last year. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=166.68s)]
*  It gives us unprecedented access to the EU market. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=170.68s)]
*  The best of any country outside of the EU or EFTA. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=175.68s)]
*  As the Prime Minister and the UK Government have been saying even [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=184.68s)]
*  before all of these deals were agreed and announced, today this marks a [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=188.68s)]
*  reset moment for relations between the EU and the UK. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=191.68s)]
*  Make no mistake, this does bring the EU and the UK closer together with [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=196.68s)]
*  these cooperation agreements, though it does not tear up much of the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=201.68s)]
*  principles and agreements of Brexit. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=205.68s)]
*  Ursula von der Leyen, president of the EU Commission, said this was a [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=208.68s)]
*  new beginning for old friends. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=212.68s)]
*  Let's listen to what she had to say at that news conference. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=215.68s)]
*  It will make a real difference to people in the UK and across our Union. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=221.68s)]
*  But the message we are sending to the world today is equally, if not more, important. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=227.68s)]
*  It is a message at a time of global instability. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=234.68s)]
*  And when our continent faces the greatest threat it has for generations, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=239.68s)]
*  we in Europe stick together. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=244.68s)]
*  We are getting some reaction from across the political spectrum. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=247.68s)]
*  We have had some reaction from the leader of the Conservative Party, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=252.68s)]
*  Kemmy Badenock. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=257.68s)]
*  Shortly after those announcements, she said she was gobsmacked by the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=259.68s)]
*  series of deals that the Prime Minister signed. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=264.68s)]
*  She said the deal on fishing, which we will go into more detail with my [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=267.68s)]
*  colleague Henry Zephman in a moment, was a sell-out. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=272.68s)]
*  She said that has taken the UK back to square one. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=275.68s)]
*  We should be using opportunities of leaving the European Union and not [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=279.68s)]
*  taking steps back. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=284.68s)]
*  She did welcome some news. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=286.68s)]
*  She welcomed the news on E-gates when it comes to passports. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=288.68s)]
*  That will give Britain's access to a separate lane now rather than the [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=292.68s)]
*  non-EU lane when they go overseas to Europe. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=298.68s)]
*  She said she had concerns about what the UK had given away in [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=301.68s)]
*  concessions. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=307.68s)]
*  Let's discuss a bit more about what we heard today and what was [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=309.68s)]
*  agreed today in the building behind us with our chief political [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=313.68s)]
*  correspondent Henry Zephman. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=317.68s)]
*  Of course, this is a big moment, whichever way you look at it. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=319.68s)]
*  If we look back to Brexit 2016 and then 2020 when agreements were [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=323.68s)]
*  made for a UK post-Brexit, it was a lot of politics, a lot of emotion. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=328.68s)]
*  How much of that existing deal has in reality been ripped up? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=333.68s)]
*  Well, the fundamentals of the UK's post-Brexit relationship with the [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=338.68s)]
*  EU are unchanged. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=343.68s)]
*  Some of the earliest debates post-Brexit, and ultimately they were [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=345.68s)]
*  settled by Theresa May, not Boris Johnson, were would the UK remain [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=348.68s)]
*  part of the single market, yes or no? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=352.68s)]
*  Would the UK remain part of the customs union, yes or no? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=354.68s)]
*  The answer to that was no as well. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=358.68s)]
*  Keir Starmer is not altering those fundamentals. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=360.68s)]
*  But what he is doing within those parameters is trying to move much [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=363.68s)]
*  closer to the European Union. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=368.68s)]
*  That is openly what he is trying to achieve here. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=370.68s)]
*  The big ticket items today which amount to that growing closeness are [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=373.68s)]
*  about the UK following the same agricultural rules as the EU. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=378.68s)]
*  That is designed to make it easier to import agricultural goods from [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=382.68s)]
*  the UK to the EU. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=386.68s)]
*  And also that extension of fishing quotas, fishing rights for European [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=388.68s)]
*  vessels in UK waters for 12 years, that might prove quite controversial. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=393.68s)]
*  Those are two fairly technical elements, but ultimately as we learnt [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=397.68s)]
*  during the Brexit negotiation years, the post-Brexit relationship [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=401.68s)]
*  between the UK and the EU amounts to an accumulation of small technical [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=404.68s)]
*  details which overall add up to a really important sense of what the [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=409.68s)]
*  relationship is. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=412.68s)]
*  Henry Zeffman, thank you very much for your assessment of the events [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=414.68s)]
*  here today. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=418.68s)]
*  There is plenty more analysis on the BBC news website. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=420.68s)]
*  If you want to go through in detail all of the different agreements on [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=423.68s)]
*  defence, security, fishing and food and more, you can find all of that [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=427.68s)]
*  on the BBC news website. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=432.68s)]
*  And of course analysis from colleagues at the BBC News website [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=434.68s)]
*  as well as from colleagues such as Henry Zeffman. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=438.68s)]
*  That's it for the moment. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=442.68s)]
*  Virginia, see you shortly. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s16vYjFE8&t=444.68s)]
