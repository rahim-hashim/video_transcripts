Video Description: At least 13 people have reportedly been killed in air strikes across Gaza overnight, after Israel said it was resuming combat operations in the Palestinian territory.

Two civilians were killed and five others injured when an Israeli drone hit a tent near the al-Mawasi humanitarian zone, the Palestinian Wafa news agency reports, citing Red Crescent medics.

Israel's army said it had targeted what it called a Hamas military site from where the group was preparing to fire into Israel. Vessels controlled by Hamas were also hit, the army said.

*  is the ceasefire over now I mean the ceasefire was really shattered by what happened yesterday [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=134.56s)]
*  which was one of the deadliest days since the war in Gaza began nearly a year and a half ago [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=140.48s)]
*  triggered by the Hamas-led deadly attacks on Israel what we've heard overnight is that strikes [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=146.48s)]
*  have been continuing Israeli army radio saying that there were 20 targets that were hit we're [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=153.83999999999997s)]
*  hearing from people on the ground that these were in the south in the center in the north of the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=160.4s)]
*  Gaza Strip displaced a people's camp a tentative camp among among one of the sites hit where we [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=166.48000000000002s)]
*  are told that there was a pregnant woman and her child among those who were killed the Israeli [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=174.4s)]
*  military said it was hitting terrorist targets and that one of the places that was it focused [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=179.04000000000002s)]
*  on in the north of the Gaza Strip was a location where there were plans to launch rockets the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=185.76s)]
*  Israeli Navy has also been firing at vessels off the coast which it says were being used by Hamas [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=191.67999999999998s)]
*  and Islamic Jihad I mean what we've seen in the last few hours is not on the scale of yesterday's [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=198.79999999999998s)]
*  bombardment but I think the message is very much that this offensive continues as the Israeli [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=205.04s)]
*  prime minister said yesterday what we saw in those hours was just the beginning and you know [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=211.04s)]
*  he has said that his aim here is to put pressure on Hamas to agree to release the hostages that [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=217.84s)]
*  it's holding of course as you were saying the families of those hostages are extremely worried [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=224.64s)]
*  many of them about what this means for their loved ones and we've had them staging rallies [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=230.95999999999998s)]
*  there are other protests going on as well today against decisions being made by the Israeli [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=236.96s)]
*  government Yolande as always really good to get your analysis Yolande now they're joining us live [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=243.68s)]
*  from Jerusalem thank you very much now we're going to talk to Oliver McTernan who's the co-founder [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=248.08s)]
*  of the conflict resolution group forward thinking and Oliver I know that you are a former negotiator [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=253.68s)]
*  in the middle east just talk us through what your understanding is of where we are with possible [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=259.12s)]
*  negotiations because arguably given the strength of those airstrikes that we've been seeing over [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=266.16s)]
*  the past few days is any potential stage two phase two of the negotiations is that even feasible [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=271.44s)]
*  given what we're witnessing Karen I think it depends entirely on one man and that one man [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=281.04s)]
*  isn't prime minister Netanyahu but it's Donald Trump I think what I gather from conversations [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=288.24s)]
*  with my Israeli contacts is that the timing of this renewal of the bombardment of Gaza [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=294.96s)]
*  is based on the need for prime minister Netanyahu to get through his budget before the end of March [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=302.32s)]
*  if he fails to do that then he is faced with the challenge of new elections and many people predict [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=312.32s)]
*  he would not win those elections so we saw at the beginning of this currency slayer [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=320.4s)]
*  the security man minister Ben-Gurvir resigning because he had stopped the war effort or the [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=326.0s)]
*  military effort rather and now we see today he has reinstated a security minister so it looks as if [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=333.6s)]
*  the timing in terms of his immediate objective getting his budget through the Knesset the [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=343.28s)]
*  coalition government surviving it seems that has worked but I come back to it I think the only [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=350.71999999999997s)]
*  person now who can get us back on track is Trump to intervene as he did we were told before his [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=356.48s)]
*  inauguration so given that Trump at the moment his focus is on Ukraine and those conversations [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=362.71999999999997s)]
*  we heard so much yesterday that telephone call with Vladimir Putin is his eye off the ball [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=370.88s)]
*  and that potentially is also why Benjamin Netanyahu is taking advantage of that and I [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=376.96s)]
*  appreciate you reference that the budget is coming up within the Israeli parliament but given that [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=382.48s)]
*  President Trump is preoccupied is that beneficial to Benjamin Netanyahu? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=388.0s)]
*  Well the argument I hear is that Trump and Netanyahu are of one mind that both believe that [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=394.32000000000005s)]
*  the way to end the Gaza situation and in particular to get the hostages returned to their families [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=401.04s)]
*  is through military pressure now if that is true I think it is highly mistaken because in this [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=410.64000000000004s)]
*  context in my experience actually threats and military action stiffen resistance they don't [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=417.36s)]
*  bring about the results that are desired so I think that we're in a complete unknown future at [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=425.84000000000003s)]
*  the moment. Oliver we're seeing the strength of feeling from the families of the hostages and [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=435.44s)]
*  we're seeing people out on the streets of Israel they're on their way they're protesting they're [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=441.04s)]
*  on their way moving to Jerusalem does that have any in your opinion inkling does that sway Benjamin [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=447.12s)]
*  Netanyahu in any way? Again you know from conversations with Israeli friends and from [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=454.8s)]
*  visiting Jerusalem a number of times and being in the Knesset my opinion is that it doesn't in fact [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=462.8s)]
*  that he's driven at the moment by the desire to survive politically because the consequences of [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=470.0s)]
*  losing the premiership remember he's facing a serious court case and I think that perhaps is [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=477.92s)]
*  limiting his vision and what is in the best interest of the country I think internally [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=486.64s)]
*  and within the region isn't always being served by this. What worries me too is that what would [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=493.44s)]
*  witnessing is a total disregard for the Fort Geneva Convention in the international law [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=499.68s)]
*  Gaza is still an occupied territory and that convention obliges the occupier which is Israel [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=506.8s)]
*  to protect the lives of citizens their dignity to ensure food water and medicine is available [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=514.08s)]
*  well we've seen all of this sort of disregarded and no real response globally so I fear what [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=522.48s)]
*  we're witnessing now just isn't impacting on the lives of the Israelis the hostages the families [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=528.88s)]
*  and the 2.3 million people in Gaza but it's having consequences for all of us and we don't seem to be [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=535.84s)]
*  aware of that without a rule-based international order I think we are going into very very dangerous [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=543.2s)]
*  waters. Oliver it's a grim note on which to leave this conversation but we are out of time Oliver [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=550.24s)]
*  Thank you very much for your analysis and expertise much more of course here on BBC News. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3knxS48eK8&t=556.08s)]
