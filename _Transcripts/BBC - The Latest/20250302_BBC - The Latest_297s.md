Video Description: Israel has blocked the entry of all humanitarian aid into Gaza, demanding Hamas agree to a US plan for a ceasefire extension.
 
The first phase of the ceasefire expired on Saturday, and Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Hamas had so far refused to accept a temporary extension under a proposal by Donald Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff.
 
A Hamas spokesman said blocking supplies to Gaza was "cheap blackmail‚Äù, and urged mediators to intervene.
 
The initial phase of the ceasefire halted 15 months of fighting between Hamas and the Israeli military, allowing the release of 33 Israeli and five Thai hostages for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.
 
But negotiations on phase two, including the release of all remaining living hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, have barely begun.

# Israel blocks entry of all humanitarian aid into Gaza | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk9wFAp6aa4)
*  Israel has stopped all humanitarian aid from entering Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk9wFAp6aa4&t=0.0s)]
*  The Prime Minister's office said the decision was taken because Hamas had refused to accept an American proposal to extend the first phase of the Gaza ceasefire, which expired on Saturday. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk9wFAp6aa4&t=5.0s)]
*  The proposal included a six-week extension of the ceasefire to cover the Muslim Ramadan and Jewish Passover periods. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk9wFAp6aa4&t=17.0s)]
*  The Israeli government backed the deal hours earlier. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk9wFAp6aa4&t=26.0s)]
*  Let's cross now to Jerusalem to speak to our diplomatic correspondent, Paul Adams. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk9wFAp6aa4&t=30.0s)]
*  Hello there to you, Paul. What's the latest on this and what's the significance of it? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk9wFAp6aa4&t=35.0s)]
*  Well, obviously, if Israel carries out this threat to stop all aid going into Gaza, that is going to be a serious blow in a place where people are only just beginning to put their lives back together again. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk9wFAp6aa4&t=42.0s)]
*  Around 4,200 trucks have gone in every week since the ceasefire began six weeks ago. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk9wFAp6aa4&t=54.0s)]
*  If all of that stops, it is going to increase hardship in the Gaza Strip considerably. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk9wFAp6aa4&t=60.0s)]
*  We don't yet know whether that threat has been carried out, but it's certainly a threat that was made an hour or so ago. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk9wFAp6aa4&t=64.0s)]
*  And it is part of a negotiating process that is a pretty rough one at the moment, because essentially we should now be into phase two of the Gaza ceasefire deal. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk9wFAp6aa4&t=71.0s)]
*  Phase one ended yesterday. We should be into a phase in which the rest of the living Israeli hostages are released. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk9wFAp6aa4&t=83.0s)]
*  And crucially, Israel starts to withdraw its troops from the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk9wFAp6aa4&t=90.0s)]
*  Israel wants an extension, and Israel says that it is supporting an American proposal for an extension that would take us essentially to the middle of April. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk9wFAp6aa4&t=96.0s)]
*  We haven't had any word from the Americans. We don't know the exact nature of the proposal. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk9wFAp6aa4&t=106.0s)]
*  But that is what the Israeli government says it is willing to do. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk9wFAp6aa4&t=110.0s)]
*  Hamas are saying that they reject that, and they are applying their own pressure. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk9wFAp6aa4&t=115.0s)]
*  Last night, they released the latest in a series of frankly cruel, humiliating videos showing Israeli hostages in captivity with one hostage, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk9wFAp6aa4&t=120.0s)]
*  Yahya Horn, saying goodbye to his younger brother, Etan, before Yahya was released a couple of weeks ago. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk9wFAp6aa4&t=131.0s)]
*  Etan remains in captivity. Clearly, that was Hamas applying what pressure it can on the Israeli government to go ahead with phase two of the ceasefire deal. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk9wFAp6aa4&t=137.0s)]
*  So we are in a situation of deadlock, with each side applying all the pressure and the mechanisms they can, and with no sign at the moment of a breakthrough. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk9wFAp6aa4&t=149.0s)]
*  All of this, of course, raises the very real possibility that at some stage we may see a return to fighting in Gaza. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk9wFAp6aa4&t=161.0s)]
*  So just to bring the line that has come from Hamas, as you said, you have said they don't respond to pressure. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk9wFAp6aa4&t=169.0s)]
*  That's what they said in their statement. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk9wFAp6aa4&t=175.0s)]
*  This decision, Hamas has said, in a statement, complicates matters and affects the negotiation process, and Hamas doesn't respond to pressures. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk9wFAp6aa4&t=177.0s)]
*  Hamas official there speaking to the Reuters news agency. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk9wFAp6aa4&t=186.0s)]
*  I mean, the timing of this in a statement that came from the Mr Netanyahu's office, there was the line that on the 42nd day, if there were issues fighting, we would continue. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk9wFAp6aa4&t=190.0s)]
*  Where are we on that, Paul? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk9wFAp6aa4&t=203.0s)]
*  Well, exactly. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk9wFAp6aa4&t=208.0s)]
*  I mean, that is what a lot of people think is the likely outcome eventually, because Hamas have shown no willingness to remove themselves as the kind of military power in Gaza, as Israel demands. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk9wFAp6aa4&t=209.0s)]
*  And Mr Netanyahu seems determined that the full dismantling and destruction of Hamas is one of his principal war goals. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk9wFAp6aa4&t=224.0s)]
*  So those two, the two sides are completely at odds, obviously, as they have been all along on the eventual outcome of all of this. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk9wFAp6aa4&t=234.0s)]
*  So that is why there is this intensive diplomatic effort to see if there can be some kind of bridging proposal. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk9wFAp6aa4&t=242.0s)]
*  That, we are told, is what the Americans are offering, an extension of phase one to allow for the release of all the remaining living Israeli hostages and perhaps some of the dead ones, too. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk9wFAp6aa4&t=248.0s)]
*  There are thought, by the way, to be 24 Israeli hostages still alive in the Gaza Strip and the release of more Palestinian prisoners. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk9wFAp6aa4&t=260.0s)]
*  But unless, but if Israel is sticking to its position that it will not begin its military withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, then it is very unlikely that Hamas are going to agree to this proposal. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk9wFAp6aa4&t=269.0s)]
*  There will be a lot of pressure being placed on, I suspect, especially on Hamas from the mediators to make it, to put, to make this bridging proposal work. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk9wFAp6aa4&t=280.0s)]
*  But we are not seeing any sign of success yet. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk9wFAp6aa4&t=292.0s)]
*  Okay, Paul Adams, thank you very much. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk9wFAp6aa4&t=294.0s)]
