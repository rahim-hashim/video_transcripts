# Syria sees outbreaks of violence and killings | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA)
*  Since overthrowing President Assad's regime, Syria's new authorities have been working to establish their control over the country. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=0.0s)]
*  But that's brought them into conflict in areas dominated by the Alawite sect, the group from which President Assad drew much of his support. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=8.0s)]
*  Fighting recently broke out with dozens of casualties, in particular around an Alawite village south of Latakia. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=16.0s)]
*  Our correspondent Lina Sinjab got exclusive access to the area. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=23.0s)]
*  And just to warn you that Lina's report does contain images that you may find distressing. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=26.0s)]
*  A village in grief, a vigil for the dead, a family in mourning. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=32.0s)]
*  This Alawite household lost four of its members, including their son, 20-year-old Habib. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=38.0s)]
*  They belonged to the same sect of former President Bashar al-Assad. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=45.0s)]
*  They are surrounding us. Bullets surround us. Pray for me, Mother. They entered the home. They killed him. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=50.0s)]
*  Fighters belonging to the new government took revenge for the killing of hundreds of their soldiers by remnants of the old regime. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=61.0s)]
*  Retaliation was indiscriminate. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=69.0s)]
*  Habib's father, Ma'an, is in his mid-60s, a retired army officer. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=73.0s)]
*  He doesn't want his face shown, fearing for his safety. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=79.0s)]
*  Yesterday, I went alone to bring him from the hospital with his aunt. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=84.0s)]
*  The Olive Grove is now a cemetery. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=90.0s)]
*  We are Alawites, and the previous president was also Alawite. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=94.0s)]
*  But we didn't like him because he was a bad person and he wasn't worth of being a president. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=99.0s)]
*  But the ones who came after are meaner and crueler. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=106.0s)]
*  In a nearby village, another massacre. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=112.0s)]
*  The White Helmets, a local civil defense group, took us to the scene. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=115.0s)]
*  Ten bodies were found. This time, it was government security officers who had been murdered. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=120.0s)]
*  They appeared to have been executed. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=127.0s)]
*  Their hands bound behind their backs, their legs tied. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=131.0s)]
*  Saber is a government security officer. He explained the attacks against the Alawites. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=136.0s)]
*  We tried hard to keep everything under control to unite Syria. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=144.0s)]
*  But honestly, the betrayal that we faced from remnants of the Assad regime made these factions angry. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=147.0s)]
*  Our official forces were killed in the coastal region, which made us lose control of the area. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=153.0s)]
*  The officer tells me they have already arrested some of the perpetrators. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=160.0s)]
*  The factions left their marks everywhere. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=167.0s)]
*  Houses and businesses burned and destroyed. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=171.0s)]
*  This is Al-Qusr neighborhood in the heart of Banias where most of the killing took place. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=174.0s)]
*  People talk about a bloodbath against the Alawites. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=180.0s)]
*  It is deserted and those who stayed behind are too scared to speak their mind. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=183.0s)]
*  The fear is the country is entering an endless cycle of revenge. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=188.0s)]
*  The Jabir family escaped minutes before government forces set fire to their house. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=195.0s)]
*  All they owned reduced to ashes. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=201.0s)]
*  I don't want anything, just my soul, the soul of my children. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=205.0s)]
*  We've got nothing to do with anything. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=209.0s)]
*  Can you tell me what happened? What do you want as a young boy? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=212.0s)]
*  I want just to live. I want just to continue my studying at university. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=215.0s)]
*  You want to stay in Syria. Do you feel that there is a future for you? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=220.0s)]
*  There is no, but I have to stay here. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=223.0s)]
*  If this government wants to prevent a new civil war, they must prove they can protect the Alawites [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=227.0s)]
*  and ensure the rights of all citizens in the new Syria. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=233.0s)]
*  Lina Sinjad, BBC News, Banias, Syria. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=238.0s)]
*  Well, Lina then returns to the Syrian capital, Damascus, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=243.0s)]
*  and I was able to ask her just how the interim government is delivering on its promise to protect civilians. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=246.0s)]
*  Well, there are lots of actions that have been taken, a public statement by the interim president, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=253.0s)]
*  a committee that has been formed to investigate the killing. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=258.0s)]
*  Some members of these factions have already been arrested, as the security officer told us in this package. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=262.0s)]
*  But I think the challenge is really huge because although the government has control over its security forces, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=269.0s)]
*  but the defence forces where many of the factions joined, they seem to be losing control over them. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=275.0s)]
*  And these are the ones who've entered the Alawite villages taking revenge and really indiscriminate killing [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=282.0s)]
*  against families even being safe in their own homes have been killed. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=287.0s)]
*  There are also the foreign fighters who are on board, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=292.0s)]
*  and there are also other uncontrolled civilians who have weapons who took part in this killing. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=294.0s)]
*  Really, the challenge is really huge, not only to protect the Alawites, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=302.0s)]
*  but to provide safety for the whole country, all minorities, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=306.0s)]
*  and to prevent any of these jihadist ideologies to be in charge of people's lives here. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=309.0s)]
*  Lena, obviously international concern is strong on this. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=318.0s)]
*  An EU conference is taking place in support of Syria. What do we hope to expect? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=322.0s)]
*  This is the first time Syria is represented in this conference that's been designed over the past nine years [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=329.0s)]
*  to help the Syrian community abroad and inside where it's possible. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=335.0s)]
*  This is the first time after the fall of Assad. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=340.0s)]
*  Of course, the government represented by the foreign minister, Assad al-Shabani, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=342.0s)]
*  is going to focus on aid, on financial aid to help the country stand on its feet again. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=346.0s)]
*  It's a country devastated by war. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=352.0s)]
*  Ninety percent of the population under the poverty line and many cities lie in ruins. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=354.0s)]
*  They need to be rebuilt. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=359.0s)]
*  But there will be a big question for them because the donor countries are also concerned [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=361.0s)]
*  about how this government is going to be inclusive of all the society. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=365.0s)]
*  We're expecting a transitional government to be announced sometimes this week. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=370.0s)]
*  So everyone is watching how this will be representative of the minorities, of women's rights, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=374.0s)]
*  and that will reflect the demands of Syrians who want democracy in the country. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=381.0s)]
*  Thanks to Lina Sinjab there reporting and speaking to me from the Syrian capital, Damascus. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=387.0s)]
*  Much more on all of our stories on our website. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l8z3bK9lSA&t=394.0s)]
