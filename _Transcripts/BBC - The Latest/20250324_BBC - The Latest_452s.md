# US-Russia officials holding Ukraine talks in Saudi, as Russian drone attacks continue | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieFDaC8t9jU)
*  Russia's news agency TASS says talks with the US aimed at bringing about a ceasefire in the war in Ukraine have now resumed in Saudi Arabia. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieFDaC8t9jU&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff says he is confident real progress can be made. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieFDaC8t9jU&t=9.0s)]
*  The US wants to secure a ceasefire in the Black Sea, building on progress last week when President Putin said he would order a 30-day pause on attacks on energy infrastructure. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieFDaC8t9jU&t=15.0s)]
*  The US delegation held talks with their Ukrainian counterparts in Riyadh last night, which Kyiv has described as productive. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieFDaC8t9jU&t=26.0s)]
*  In Ukraine itself, the Air Force says it shot down 57 of 99 drones launched by Russia overnight. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieFDaC8t9jU&t=33.0s)]
*  Our security correspondent Frank Gardner, who is in Riyadh, explained what it's hoped the talks can achieve. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieFDaC8t9jU&t=40.0s)]
*  The Americans are resolutely upbeat. I think they have a rather oversimplistic view as just the complexities of trying to reach even a ceasefire, let alone a full peace deal. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieFDaC8t9jU&t=47.0s)]
*  You heard there Steve Witkoff, the special envoy of Donald Trump, saying that today, Monday in Saudi Arabia, I think you're going to see real progress. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieFDaC8t9jU&t=58.0s)]
*  Well, what does that actually mean? I think expectations are having to be dialed back a bit. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieFDaC8t9jU&t=66.0s)]
*  It's not going to be a full comprehensive 30-day ceasefire, which the Ukrainians have agreed to, the Americans have agreed to, but the Russians haven't. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieFDaC8t9jU&t=72.0s)]
*  Instead, what they're focusing on now, a short distance away from here, behind the Bugavillia-clad walls of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, is the technical details of a Black Sea deal. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieFDaC8t9jU&t=80.0s)]
*  There was a deal in 2022 that allowed Ukraine to export its grain from its ports in the Black Sea without being attacked by Russia. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieFDaC8t9jU&t=93.0s)]
*  And in return, Russia wanted to export its own farm produce and wanted some sanctions relief. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieFDaC8t9jU&t=103.0s)]
*  But that deal got cancelled a year later. The Russians pulled out. They weren't happy that the sanctions relief never happened. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieFDaC8t9jU&t=110.0s)]
*  Russia, remember, is a heavily sanctioned country by much of the world. They want to revive that. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieFDaC8t9jU&t=117.0s)]
*  Their economy is having quite a lot of difficulties, as is Ukraine's, and they want to talk about that. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieFDaC8t9jU&t=123.0s)]
*  So I think it's a fairly limited aim today. The Americans are saying, well, if we can at least achieve that, then we can build on that to have a full ceasefire that protects energy infrastructure, oil depots, things like that, and eventually stop the fighting on land. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieFDaC8t9jU&t=129.0s)]
*  I'm not seeing any great appetite for stopping the fighting on the land from Moscow because they are slowly winning there, very slowly, incrementally pushing the Ukrainians back. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieFDaC8t9jU&t=145.0s)]
*  So they're not in a hurry to stop the fighting there, but they would like to protect their oil installations, which are getting a hammering from Ukraine's long range drones. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieFDaC8t9jU&t=156.0s)]
*  And there does seem to still be a huge gulf in demands between what Ukraine is willing to accept when it comes to a ceasefire and what Russia is willing to accept. Is there any sense that Russia is moving on its demands at all? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieFDaC8t9jU&t=166.0s)]
*  Not that I can see, no. I mean, the Ukrainians, I think, are still very bruised by that horrendous encounter in the Oval Office on the 28th of February, where President Zelensky got a real dressing down from Donald Trump and his vice president, JD Vance. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieFDaC8t9jU&t=180.0s)]
*  And since then, they've been taking a lot of advice, including from Britain's national security adviser, Jonathan Powell, who said to them, look, you've got to keep the Americans on board. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieFDaC8t9jU&t=197.0s)]
*  You cannot afford to lose U.S. support. The problem is that the American view under this administration, the Trump administration, is very close to Moscow's view. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieFDaC8t9jU&t=210.0s)]
*  It's quite different to that of the Biden administration. It's quite different to NATO's view, which is very clearly that Russia is the aggressor, that this was an unprovoked invasion by Russia of a sovereign country in 2022. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieFDaC8t9jU&t=220.0s)]
*  That's not Steve Witkoff's view. He's been making his views known that they are basically almost taking the Kremlin line. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieFDaC8t9jU&t=234.0s)]
*  Frank Gardner there in Riyadh. Well, earlier I spoke to Alexander Maresko, Ukrainian MP and chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, on what he hopes will come out of the talks. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieFDaC8t9jU&t=243.0s)]
*  But again, everything depends on Putin, and he's not interested in ceasefire or peace. And he's a major hurdle on the way to ceasefire. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieFDaC8t9jU&t=273.0s)]
*  Ukraine has agreed unconditionally to Mr. Trump's ceasefire proposal. Russia, Putin has rejected it. And that's why I don't have high expectations. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieFDaC8t9jU&t=284.0s)]
*  So what would be a good outcome from these talks? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieFDaC8t9jU&t=294.0s)]
*  Well, I think on a positive note, it would be great at least to have partial ceasefire with regard to critical energy infrastructure, our power grid. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieFDaC8t9jU&t=299.0s)]
*  But again, we have seen many times that Putin makes the promise and then he violates it immediately. That's why it might be the best result, the best outcome. But again, I remain doubtful. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieFDaC8t9jU&t=312.0s)]
*  President Zelensky has said that Vladimir Putin needs to be pushed, in his words, to bring an end to the fighting. How can he be pushed? What do you think incentives can be given to him? A carrot or stick here? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieFDaC8t9jU&t=325.0s)]
*  Well, in case of Putin, he takes carrots as a sign of weakness, unfortunately. It doesn't work that way. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieFDaC8t9jU&t=338.0s)]
*  And the thing is that you don't need negotiations because he will never honor the result of negotiations or some kind of agreement. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieFDaC8t9jU&t=345.0s)]
*  The only way to deal with Putin is from the position of strength. And the only way to make him to do anything is to put more pressure in the form of sanctions, for example, sanctions against Russian energy, banking and financial sectors of economy, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieFDaC8t9jU&t=353.0s)]
*  in the form of secondary sanctions against those companies and countries which help Putin to circumvent primary sanctions and also by providing more military aid to Ukraine. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieFDaC8t9jU&t=371.0s)]
*  That's the only way the West can deal with the aggressor. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieFDaC8t9jU&t=383.0s)]
*  And what's your view about the US's role here and how they're conducting themselves and their comments about Putin? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieFDaC8t9jU&t=388.0s)]
*  Well, we were extremely disappointed and shocked by the recent statements by the President Trump envoy, Mr. Witkov, because he's parroting Putin's propaganda. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieFDaC8t9jU&t=396.0s)]
*  And we are very concerned about this. It's totally unacceptable what he said. And it's Putin's lies. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieFDaC8t9jU&t=410.0s)]
*  It means that he's either totally unprofessional and not fit for his position, for his role, which is very important, or he's like acting in the interests of Putin. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieFDaC8t9jU&t=417.0s)]
*  So I'm confused personally about these statements. And I think that President Trump should make very clearly that the United States will continue to support territorial integrity of Ukraine because it has always been US foreign policy. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieFDaC8t9jU&t=429.0s)]
*  And it's in the best national interest of the United States. Ukrainian MP Oleksandr Morozov could go there. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieFDaC8t9jU&t=444.0s)]
