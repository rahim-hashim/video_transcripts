Video Description: President Volodymr Zelensky and US Vice-President JD Vance have been discussing the war in Ukraine in a meeting on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
 
It comes after Vance criticised European leaders over free speech and democracy at the summit, telling world leaders "there is a new sheriff in town", referring to US President Donald Trump.
 
Earlier Zelensky said he doesn’t see a “ready US plan” to end the Ukraine war.

Trump had said US, Russian and Ukrainian officials would meet in Munich - but Moscow said they are not sending a delegation to the summit.

# Zelensky meeting with US Vice President | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [February 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE)
*  Let us return to Munich and that major security conference dominated by Ukraine. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=0.0s)]
*  It represents one of the most consequential meetings in decades after Donald Trump stunned [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=5.84s)]
*  allies with his phone call to Vladimir Putin on Wednesday and his plans to negotiate with [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=10.92s)]
*  Moscow to end the war. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=15.24s)]
*  That left many Europeans accusing the US of Russian appeasement. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=17.8s)]
*  So let's recap where we are at the end of this week. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=22.0s)]
*  The US Vice President, JD Vance, has warned Russia that it might impose economic sanctions [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=26.08s)]
*  if the country refused to agree what he called a good peace deal with Ukraine. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  Later, he told The Gathering, there's a new sheriff in town in Washington. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=35.44s)]
*  But some senior American senators at the conference have called for the US to continue arming [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=40.64s)]
*  Ukraine with one advising Mr Trump not to be afraid of Moscow. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=45.36s)]
*  President Zelensky said he didn't believe the US has a plan for peace yet and that Ukraine [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=50.96s)]
*  will never recognise the occupied territories as Russian. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=55.92s)]
*  And he insisted his country does still want to join NATO. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=59.52s)]
*  Meanwhile, Germany's president said Europe had to accept that President Trump's administration [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=62.760000000000005s)]
*  wouldn't respect established rules of trusted relationships in international politics. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=68.08s)]
*  A reminder that President Zelensky is currently meeting with the US president when there's [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=73.76s)]
*  either pictures or comment. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=79.64s)]
*  We'll bring that immediately to you here on the programme. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=81.28s)]
*  But in the last what, hour, hour and a half we've heard from Ukraine's president, he [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=84.8s)]
*  responded to the suggestion that Donald Trump was emboldening Vladimir Putin. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=89.36s)]
*  We, we had such conversations with Putin, direct conversation about ceasefire. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=114.8s)]
*  But he will not just, you know, ceasefire and that's all. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=121.24s)]
*  That's why I said to president, yes, but I think phone calls are phone calls. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=124.39999999999999s)]
*  Let's forget about it. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=128.84s)]
*  I think what is very important, the meeting, not to make any decisions about Ukraine without [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=129.84s)]
*  Ukraine. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=136.8s)]
*  This is principle position we will never accept, accept it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=137.8s)]
*  When I said that we will never accept, I'm not speaking just about me. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=141.4s)]
*  I'm speaking about all our people, all our nation. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=145.52s)]
*  People will not stop. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=149.04000000000002s)]
*  We will give him pause. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=150.04000000000002s)]
*  Without the real security guarantee, we will give him pause. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=151.52s)]
*  I don't want to, you know, be those person in the history who helped Putin to occupy [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  my country. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=159.88s)]
*  I don't want it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=161.84s)]
*  And that's why I will never do it. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=163.64000000000001s)]
*  I will never do it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=167.24s)]
*  And that is very important for me to pressure Putin, put all the sanctions. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=168.84s)]
*  I think President Trump is ready to do it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=174.0s)]
*  He has all this power to do it. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=176.36s)]
*  Well, that was President Zelensky speaking at that town hall in the last hour or so. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=178.36s)]
*  Also there was the Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who was asked if he was comfortable [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=182.96s)]
*  with Donald Trump doing deals with authoritarian leaders like President Putin before consulting [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=187.52s)]
*  European allies. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=193.52s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=194.52s)]
*  It doesn't matter to me who Trump calls or when he calls. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=196.44s)]
*  It matters to me how it ends. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=199.94s)]
*  Afghanistan ended poorly. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=202.48s)]
*  Do you all agree with that? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=203.48s)]
*  Well, this will not end poorly. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=204.92s)]
*  President Trump is not going to do in Ukraine what we did in Afghanistan. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=208.26s)]
*  He's going to try to find a way to make sure this war ends sooner rather than later. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=212.35999999999999s)]
*  And when I talk to people about at home why it matters, Putin won't stop unless somebody [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=217.78s)]
*  stops him. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=222.16s)]
*  Well, you're stopping him. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=223.16s)]
*  But he'll keep going unless you get the conditions right. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=224.32s)]
*  So here's what I think is going to happen. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=227.24s)]
*  I think he's going to find a way to end this war in a fashion that Putin would be a fool [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=229.07999999999998s)]
*  to do it again. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=233.84s)]
*  Very quickly, how do you deter Putin? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=235.66s)]
*  Yarn this guy to the teeth. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=238.04s)]
*  You give him a bunch of F-16s, not a few F-16s. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=241.07999999999998s)]
*  You give them a tacoms. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=245.12s)]
*  You give them tanks because they will fight. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=246.12s)]
*  Remind me not to invade Ukraine, okay? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=249.76s)]
*  It just doesn't work out well. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=251.72s)]
*  So let's arm this guy. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=253.88s)]
*  Let's do the minerals agreement so we'll have American business interests. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=255.72s)]
*  Putin doesn't understand what's going on. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=259.4s)]
*  If we sign this minerals agreement, Putin is screwed because Trump will defend the deal. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=260.92s)]
*  So the best thing that's going to happen here is he's going to do a deal with you, I hope, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=267.0s)]
*  and he will defend America's interests. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=271.9s)]
*  So this war is going to come to an end, I hope, sooner rather than later, and it's going [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=274.76s)]
*  to come to an end in a way where it won't happen again. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=279.0s)]
*  I have every confidence in the world that Donald Trump will end this war in a way that [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=281.44s)]
*  there will be no third invasion of Ukraine. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=286.48s)]
*  Well, that was Lindsay Graham now in Poland. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=288.88s)]
*  The US Defense Secretary, Pete Hegseth, has held talks with his Polish counterpart, and [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=291.6s)]
*  he repeated his warning that Europe had to take more responsibility for their own security [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=296.96s)]
*  and that Ukraine joining NATO was, quote, unlikely. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=302.04s)]
*  So my job today in Brussels was to introduce realism to the conversation. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=306.44s)]
*  The reality that returning to 2014 as borders as part of a negotiated settlement is unlikely. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=313.76s)]
*  The reality of US troops in Ukraine is unlikely. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=320.88s)]
*  The reality of Ukraine membership in NATO as a part of a negotiated settlement, unlikely. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=325.2s)]
*  And I stand by the comments that I made on that first day in the Ukraine contact group, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=332.14s)]
*  and that's for all the press out there. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=337.76s)]
*  It's difficult for them to understand that. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=339.74s)]
*  We stand by the statements we made in reality about the status of US forces or Ukraine's [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=341.46s)]
*  involvement in NATO and the unlikely nature of that. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=348.21999999999997s)]
*  That said, I would never put constraints around what the President of the United States would [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=351.58s)]
*  be willing to negotiate with the sovereign leaders of both Russia and Ukraine. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=357.18s)]
*  Well, after meeting with the German president a little earlier in the day, the US Vice President [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=362.26s)]
*  JD Vance addressed that same conference in Munich and provoked anger after accusing [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=367.98s)]
*  European countries of backsliding on free speech. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=373.94s)]
*  So I come here today not just with an observation, but with an offer. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=378.06s)]
*  First as the Biden administration seem desperate to silence people for speaking their minds, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=382.94s)]
*  so the Trump administration will do precisely the opposite and I hope that we can work together [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=387.78s)]
*  on that. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=393.42s)]
*  In Washington, there is a new sheriff in town and under Donald Trump's leadership, we may [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=394.42s)]
*  disagree with your views, but we will fight to defend your right to offer it in the public [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=400.22s)]
*  square, agree or disagree. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=405.06s)]
*  Well, that was JD Vance. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=407.46s)]
*  He is currently meeting with President Zelensky. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=408.98s)]
*  Let's speak to Ukraine's former President Petro Poroshenko, who joins me live from Kyiv. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=411.46s)]
*  Thank you so much for being here on BBC News. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=417.06s)]
*  Let me start by asking you, how worried are you that Donald Trump might try to negotiate [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=420.46s)]
*  an end to this war without Ukraine being there at the table? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=426.58s)]
*  This is unacceptable and I don't believe that President Trump will do that because I worked [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=432.9s)]
*  with President Trump for three years and I know for sure that if we have a plan and have [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=438.82s)]
*  a scenario, President Trump will definitely keep it and there is no exist any plan of [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=446.82s)]
*  General Kellogg or National Security Advisor Vance or Vice President Vance. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=454.2s)]
*  There is a plan of President Trump and one of the key points for this plan is nothing [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=460.18s)]
*  about Ukraine without Ukraine. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=467.32s)]
*  This is the principle I established and I worked with Trump during the time of my President [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=468.96000000000004s)]
*  term. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=475.32s)]
*  Nothing about Europe without Europe. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=477.24s)]
*  This is also a key point. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=479.28000000000003s)]
*  With that situation, you cannot find out any other nation in the world who wants peace [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=482.56s)]
*  more than we, Ukraine, because we pay the highest price for that. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=487.16s)]
*  I hate to interrupt you but we are just getting the feed of the pictures of Zelensky and the [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=494.16s)]
*  US Vice President. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=500.72s)]
*  I'm just going to play that on the screen. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=501.72s)]
*  Great, thank you all. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=502.72s)]
*  Take care guys. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=503.72s)]
*  Ukraine is not ready to come to the table with Putin. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=504.72s)]
*  If Ukraine is not ready to speak with Putin at the table, how do you move forward? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=505.72s)]
*  Will you still negotiate? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=506.72s)]
*  Well look, I think the way that this conversation moves us forward is first of all you have great [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=507.72s)]
*  members of the Ukrainian delegation and you have great members of the Ukrainian delegation [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=510.72s)]
*  and you have great members of the Ukrainian delegation and you have great members of the [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=511.72s)]
*  Ukrainian delegation and you have great members of the Ukrainian delegation and you have great [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=512.72s)]
*  members of the Ukrainian delegation and you have great members of the Ukrainian delegation [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=513.72s)]
*  and you have great members of the Ukrainian delegation and you have great members of the [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=514.72s)]
*  Ukrainian delegation and you have great members of the Ukrainian delegation and you have [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=515.72s)]
*  I think the way that this conversation moves us forward is first of all you have great [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=517.72s)]
*  members of the Ukrainian delegation. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=521.52s)]
*  You have our incredible Secretary of State Marco Rubio here. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=523.76s)]
*  We have General Kellogg. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=527.48s)]
*  It's important for us to get together and start to have the conversations that are going [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=529.0s)]
*  to be necessary to bring this thing to a close. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=532.12s)]
*  That's all I'm going to say for now because I want to preserve the optionality here from [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=534.6s)]
*  the negotiators and our respective teams to bring this thing to a responsible close. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=538.36s)]
*  Thank you all and have a good night. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=542.8000000000001s)]
*  What is the timeline? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=543.8000000000001s)]
*  Well, an absolute avalanche of questions with those two leaders not saying any more as I [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=544.8s)]
*  suspect the cameras are going to be ushered out of that room in the next few seconds but [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=565.4799999999999s)]
*  J.D. Vance you heard very briefly from President Zelensky so that meeting those the pictures [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=570.6s)]
*  they'll now get down to real talk so a little later I suspect we'll get a little more from [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=577.44s)]
*  those two leaders. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=583.0s)]
*  Petro Poroshenko apologies to break away that was important just to show our viewers what [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=584.16s)]
*  is currently happening in Munich. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=589.5600000000001s)]
*  You were talking about Ukraine needing to be there at the negotiating table. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=592.48s)]
*  Were you concerned to hear Donald Trump earlier in the week appear to make really obvious [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=598.48s)]
*  concessions which was that there would be no NATO membership from Ukraine? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=604.72s)]
*  His defence secretary saying they would not go back to the borders of 2014. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=610.8800000000001s)]
*  Did that worry you when you heard some of those things even before the negotiations [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=615.94s)]
*  start to end this war? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=620.72s)]
*  I can declare you the absolutely crystal clear Ukrainian position. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=623.06s)]
*  I want to remind you the words of the President Reagan then we maintain peace through strength. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=628.7399999999999s)]
*  Exactly this phrase was used in the President Trump because peace through weakness is only [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=637.02s)]
*  invite the aggression. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=644.3399999999999s)]
*  We have a five non-compromised point five red lines. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=645.54s)]
*  Point number one this is no compromise on the sovereignty and national identity of [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=651.02s)]
*  Ukraine we never be the Russian colony. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=655.42s)]
*  Point number two non-compromise on the territory integrity of Ukraine. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=659.86s)]
*  Point number three non-compromise on the armed forces of Ukraine and it limits because this [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=663.86s)]
*  is the guarantee for existing of Ukrainian sovereign independent states. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=668.14s)]
*  Point number four non-compromise on sanction because this is the strong motivation for [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=672.8199999999999s)]
*  Putin to keep him at the table of negotiation. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=678.36s)]
*  And point number five non-compromise on NATO and EU. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=680.9200000000001s)]
*  And President Trump is absolutely right. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=685.08s)]
*  I hate the idea that we will discuss the NATO membership of Ukraine with Putin. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=686.9200000000001s)]
*  Putin shouldn't have any veto right and any red light. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=693.52s)]
*  This is the 30 NATO member states position and position of Ukrainian people. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=698.0400000000001s)]
*  I'm proud that I'm introducing Ukrainian constitution the future membership of Ukraine [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=704.72s)]
*  and NATO. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=710.52s)]
*  I hear your five points. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=711.52s)]
*  It'll be interesting to see how much of that is taken on board by the Americans and how [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=716.24s)]
*  much may in the end be wishful thinking. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=721.28s)]
*  But if Ukraine has to make compromises what compromises do you think you could make? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=724.6800000000001s)]
*  Everything else outside of these five points is possible. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=733.12s)]
*  I think that we can erase any obstacle. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=738.72s)]
*  We should believe in our victory. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=746.48s)]
*  And with that situation I really count on President Trump. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=749.08s)]
*  And for having that we should bring Ukraine to negotiations stronger. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=753.08s)]
*  We should have weapons, long range missile, air defence. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=758.16s)]
*  And with this situation we should understand that this is at stake. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=763.12s)]
*  Ukraine exists. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=770.48s)]
*  Does it survive as a Ukrainian state or will it be destroyed? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=771.48s)]
*  Do you think it's likely to get more sanctions, more weapons, already unlikely given everything [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=776.0799999999999s)]
*  that has come from the current White House? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=781.64s)]
*  Do you think that's really possible going into any sort of negotiations to get more [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=785.28s)]
*  armaments, more sanctions? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=790.3199999999999s)]
*  I don't even think about that. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=793.12s)]
*  I'm confident in that. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=795.0799999999999s)]
*  Because I know for sure Putin don't want peace. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=797.0799999999999s)]
*  Don't trust Putin. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=801.56s)]
*  Don't expect that Putin will accept the position of Ukraine or the position of President Trump [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=803.28s)]
*  or I hope joint position. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=808.8s)]
*  We have only one condition when we can reach the results to make negotiation position stronger. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=811.56s)]
*  And if Putin do not accept Trump should be decisive enough to give us more weapons, to [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=819.04s)]
*  give us more sanctions, to make us strengthen transatlantic unity and to keep democracy [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=825.9599999999999s)]
*  and reform in Ukraine, to keep the support of Ukraine. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=832.4599999999999s)]
*  And I was the president of the country in the state of war. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=837.3599999999999s)]
*  And if you don't believe in your victory, nothing can happen. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=840.24s)]
*  You will lose. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=843.36s)]
*  What would happen if the deal put to Ukraine and put to Vladimir Putin is basically the [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=844.8s)]
*  territory that Russia has taken, they keep and some sort of long format of status is [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=851.44s)]
*  then talked about. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=861.24s)]
*  Is that acceptable or unacceptable? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=862.8s)]
*  We will not accept any loss of Ukrainian territory. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=866.56s)]
*  Point number one. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=873.8s)]
*  Point number two. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=875.4799999999999s)]
*  I kindly ask... [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=876.8399999999999s)]
*  What happens though, before you get to point number two, what happens if that is the deal [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=878.64s)]
*  that's presented to you? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=882.7199999999999s)]
*  We do not accept official status of Ukrainian occupied territory as a Russian territory. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=885.8399999999999s)]
*  I want to remind you that I signed together with President Trump so-called Pompeo Declaration [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=892.96s)]
*  of the Crimea and other occupied territory. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=899.6s)]
*  And there was absolutely strong message from President Trump that United States never recognize [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=902.44s)]
*  any occupied Ukrainian territory. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=909.5400000000001s)]
*  I'm absolutely confident... [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=912.48s)]
*  If that though... [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=914.12s)]
*  Let me put a question to you though. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=915.12s)]
*  If that is part of the deal that is put to Ukraine and that is what Donald Trump actually [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=917.02s)]
*  considers is the plan, what choice does Ukraine have because you can't continue this war without [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=922.4s)]
*  the Americans, can you? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=929.92s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=932.28s)]
*  But we cannot lose this war. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=933.84s)]
*  And again, please learn the lesson 1938 in Munich and think that if it would be appeasement [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=935.76s)]
*  for the aggressor, that would be a losing, that would be defeat of the country. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=944.4s)]
*  And I know for sure President Trump, he never accept the scenario and he will lose. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=951.68s)]
*  And I strongly support, make America great again, I really happy, make Europe great again [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=959.2399999999999s)]
*  and make Ukraine great again, not Russia. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=966.7199999999999s)]
*  Make Russia small again. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=970.9599999999999s)]
*  One more question. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=972.8399999999999s)]
*  One more question then. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=973.8399999999999s)]
*  Do you accept now that NATO membership is not going to happen? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=975.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, because this is the homework for Ukraine. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=980.6s)]
*  We should prepare our country for NATO, not only by military means, but also by means of [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=986.16s)]
*  democracy, means of freedom, means rule of law, means fundamental, means fighting against [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=991.9599999999999s)]
*  corruption. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=999.3199999999999s)]
*  We have lots of things to be done. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=1000.3199999999999s)]
*  And with this position, I want to just have one principle fact. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=1002.1999999999999s)]
*  The future membership of Ukraine in NATO should be on the table. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=1008.36s)]
*  We have the door of NATO open for us since 2008 with the Bucharest summit of NATO. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=1012.84s)]
*  Sure, but you heard what the US defence secretary said. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=1018.8000000000001s)]
*  He said it again today. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=1021.92s)]
*  He's in no doubt that it's unrealistic. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=1023.44s)]
*  I think that it is before meeting with Putin. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=1029.32s)]
*  Again, I don't believe that Putin will effectively cooperate for implementation of President [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=1034.56s)]
*  Trump plan. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=1044.8799999999999s)]
*  With this situation, I think it was a test. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=1046.24s)]
*  Does Ukraine accept it or not? [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=1051.8s)]
*  Does other NATO member states accept it or not? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=1053.6799999999998s)]
*  And definitely any of NATO member states can put the situation on hold, but nobody can [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=1056.8799999999999s)]
*  close a NATO door for Ukraine. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=1063.92s)]
*  Petro Poroshenko, we have to leave it there. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=1067.6000000000001s)]
*  Thank you so much for taking time to speak to us here at BBC News. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=1070.1200000000001s)]
*  Just as we were hearing the last answer, let me tell you, the EU's top diplomat, Kaya Kalles, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=1074.4s)]
*  has just said listening to JD Vance's speech a little earlier, it was as if they're trying [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=1079.6000000000001s)]
*  to pick a fight with us. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=1084.5600000000002s)]
*  So that's quite a response to what the US vice president told delegates there in Munich [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=1086.6000000000001s)]
*  a short while ago. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=1092.6s)]
*  We'll have more in just a moment around the world and across the UK. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=1093.6s)]
*  You're watching BBC News. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6nlUVMFbNE&t=1096.72s)]
