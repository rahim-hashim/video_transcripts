Video Description: India has closed its main border crossing with Pakistan, expelled its military diplomats and suspended a landmark water-sharing treaty following an attack that killed 26 people in Indian-administered Kashmir.
 
Pakistan has denied involvement in the attack and will convene a national security meeting on Thursday to discuss a response to the measures taken by India.
 
Gunmen burst out of forests and opened fire on visitors with automatic weapons in the attack near the picturesque tourist town of Pahalgam.
 
There's been no official confirmation yet on who carried out the brutal attack but some media reports say a group linked to Pakistan-based organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba may have claimed responsibility.
