Video Description: Canada's next prime minister, Mark Carney, vowed to win the trade war against US President Donald Trump, after a landslide victory to replace Justin Trudeau.

Carney, who will be sworn in as PM in the coming days, pledges retaliatory tariffs on US goods until "Americans show us respect‚Äù.

The 59-year-old, who has never held elected office, easily won the leadership race with 86% of the vote.
 
Carney is likely to announce a speedy general election, and although the gap is narrowing with the Conservative opposition, the polls show them still in the lead

# Canada's next PM Mark Carney vows to win trade war with Trump | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk)
*  Now, Canada will never ever be part of America. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=0.0s)]
*  Those were the words of the country's incoming Prime Minister Mark Carney, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=3.48s)]
*  who won a resounding victory in the race to succeed Justin Trudeau. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=7.08s)]
*  He promised to win the trade war against the US, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=10.76s)]
*  and he hit back against Donald Trump's threat to make Canada the 51st state. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=13.16s)]
*  Mr Carney, to remind you, is the former governor of the Bank of England. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=18.12s)]
*  He has never been elected as an MP, let alone served in a cabinet post, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  but received 85% of the vote to be elected as the new leader of the governing Liberal Party. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=25.72s)]
*  He thanked his supporters and said he would ensure the party continued to stand [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=31.56s)]
*  for fiscal responsibility, social justice and international leadership. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=35.239999999999995s)]
*  In his speech, he also said the country, as I mentioned, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=40.4s)]
*  would never be part of America in any way, shape or form. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=43.36s)]
*  These are dark days. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  Dark days brought on by a country we can no longer trust. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  We are getting over the shock, but let us never forget the lessons. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=58.559999999999995s)]
*  We have to look after ourselves, and we have to look out for each other. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=65.56s)]
*  We need to pull together. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  Our correspondent, John Sudworth, was in Ottawa as Mr Carney's victory was announced. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=77.0s)]
*  This was a thumping victory for Mark Carney. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=82.08s)]
*  We saw him on the stage here, accepting the leadership of the party, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=85.76s)]
*  and of course, by default, he will soon be Canada's next prime minister. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=91.12s)]
*  It is an extraordinary result for the central banker, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  who despite having a lot of leadership experience, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=100.80000000000001s)]
*  of course, has very little political experience. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=103.56s)]
*  But politics in this country has been turned on its head in recent weeks, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=107.96s)]
*  largely because of what's been happening on the other side of its southern border, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=112.4s)]
*  with Mr Trump launching attacks on this country's economy, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=116.92s)]
*  with the trade war, and also saying that he wants to make Canada [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=122.24s)]
*  the 51st state of America. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=126.32s)]
*  That is something Mr Carney said he would never allow to happen. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=128.6s)]
*  You can see the assembled ranks of the media behind me [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=134.0s)]
*  and you can see their studios built there. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=137.4s)]
*  The anticipation across the board is that Mark Carney will now call [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=139.79999999999998s)]
*  an early general election in an attempt to make his leadership [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=144.32s)]
*  of this country his own. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  He still faces an uphill struggle. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=152.24s)]
*  The Conservatives are leading in the polls, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=154.12s)]
*  but that gap has been narrowing dramatically recently [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=157.35999999999999s)]
*  because of that geopolitical dynamic. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=161.2s)]
*  That once seemed tired after three terms in office [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=164.84s)]
*  and facing mounting public anger over the cost of living [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=167.92s)]
*  suddenly feels very optimistic. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=172.48s)]
*  And this upcoming election will be one that is just as much [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=174.88s)]
*  about sovereignty as it is the economy. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=180.44s)]
*  And that is in large part because of President Trump. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=184.32s)]
*  On sub-warfare in Ottawa, let's speak to Drew Fagan, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=188.56s)]
*  a professor at the Munk School of Global Affairs [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=191.12s)]
*  and Public Policy at the University of Toronto. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=193.12s)]
*  Drew, good to see you again. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=195.76s)]
*  So Mark Carney, really the man of this particular moment. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=197.48000000000002s)]
*  Can you kind of flesh out a bit more for us the environment [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=201.4s)]
*  in Canada at the moment with this trade war that's taking place [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=204.16s)]
*  with the US and these threats constantly from President Trump [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=207.6s)]
*  to make Canada the 51st state? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=211.12s)]
*  Well, it is an extraordinary time. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=213.48000000000002s)]
*  We expected challenges after Donald Trump was re-elected [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=216.20000000000002s)]
*  in November, but nothing like this. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=220.6s)]
*  He's upended the free trade agreement that we've depended [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=223.24s)]
*  on for decades, both of us have benefited from it, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=226.88s)]
*  both countries, and he's gone further. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=230.52s)]
*  He's essentially said that he's looking to a next Canada, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=233.44s)]
*  which is there's history in that, goes back 100 years, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=236.92000000000002s)]
*  150 years, but nothing in modern times. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=240.24s)]
*  So the political environment here has completely changed, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=244.6s)]
*  not just in terms of the political parties [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=248.72s)]
*  and where they stand, but also the fundamental issue [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=251.44s)]
*  driving the country. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=254.68s)]
*  Whereas just months ago, it was sort of the cost of living, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=256.16s)]
*  housing prices, everyday issues like that, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=259.24s)]
*  now it's existential. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=262.24s)]
*  Drew, I've been looking at some newspaper headlines [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=264.4s)]
*  in Canada today, and of course they cover [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=266.6s)]
*  the resounding victory of Mark Carney. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=269.04s)]
*  But the very next thing they say is what next? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=271.36s)]
*  He's promising a plan, what details do we know [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=274.8s)]
*  about what his plan is? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=277.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, the plan right now is probably to go to an election [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=279.68s)]
*  and do so very quickly, possibly within a week, 10 days, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=283.6s)]
*  almost as soon as he has officially taken power. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=289.36s)]
*  For one reason, he doesn't have a seat [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=293.04s)]
*  in the House of Commons, he has very little [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=294.56s)]
*  political experience, obviously, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=296.36s)]
*  except for running for leader, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=298.88s)]
*  but he does have fundamental experiences [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=300.28000000000003s)]
*  as probably the most senior technocrat in the country, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=302.6s)]
*  and again in Great Britain as governor of the Bank of Canada, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=306.0s)]
*  governor of the Bank of England. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=308.64s)]
*  He is viewed in polling as the person best placed [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=310.03999999999996s)]
*  to take on Donald Trump. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=314.59999999999997s)]
*  And that is a huge card right now [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=316.68s)]
*  as compared to the conservative leader, Pierre Poliev. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=319.56s)]
*  The conservatives are still marginally head in the polls, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=322.67999999999995s)]
*  but there's no question that the wind [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=326.44s)]
*  is behind the liberals right now. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=328.76s)]
*  What are the conservatives saying? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=330.47999999999996s)]
*  How is Mr. Poliev playing this right now? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=332.28s)]
*  Because the attack ads have already started. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=334.84000000000003s)]
*  They absolutely have, elitist and just like Justin. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=337.32s)]
*  So the view of Justin Trudeau is that over the last decade, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=342.36s)]
*  he's emphasized and made progress [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=346.76s)]
*  on fundamental social issues like climate change, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=349.52000000000004s)]
*  indigenous reconciliation, but less focused on the economy. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=352.68s)]
*  And so the Pierre Poliev had been looking, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=358.24s)]
*  had been expecting to emphasize that. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=362.76s)]
*  He's trying to tie Mark Carney closely to Justin Trudeau. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=365.68s)]
*  As I say, the headline is just like Trudeau, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=369.48s)]
*  just like Justin, but we'll see how successful that is, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=372.88s)]
*  because given Mark Carney's capacity [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=377.12s)]
*  in overseeing an economy from his previous roles, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=380.44s)]
*  and what he says will be a closer focus [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=383.28s)]
*  on the economy going forward, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=386.12s)]
*  he'll try to, and possibly successfully, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=388.88s)]
*  make a real difference between the future [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=393.2s)]
*  under the liberals and the past. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=395.6s)]
*  Drew, it's impossible right now to know from day to day [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=397.32s)]
*  what Donald Trump is going to do [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=400.44s)]
*  and what might happen indeed with the trade war. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=402.72s)]
*  How are Canadians handling all of this uncertainty? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=405.24s)]
*  Well, I think as we've always been, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=408.96000000000004s)]
*  the ideas were not nearly as big as the United States. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=412.2s)]
*  We're a middle weight and they're a super heavy weight. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=415.64s)]
*  We need to be resilient, we need to be united, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=417.92s)]
*  and we need to be smarter in our negotiations. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=421.32s)]
*  And I think that's part of the reason [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=425.04s)]
*  why people are getting behind Mark Carney, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=426.76s)]
*  given his global experience. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=429.0s)]
*  Drew Fagan, great to have you with us again. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=431.44s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=432.92s)]
*  Thank you, Lucy. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6HdxQBPeTk&t=434.36s)]
