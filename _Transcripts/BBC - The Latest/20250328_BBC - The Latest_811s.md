Video Description: Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the billionaire co-owner of Manchester United, has told BBC Sports Editor Dan Roan that the football club has “come off the rails” but will show grit and resilience and “come out the other side fighting”. 

The 72-year-old spent £1.3 billion buying a 29% stake in the club in 2024, in a deal which saw Ineos take control of football operations.  Ratcliffe, a lifelong Manchester United fan, is chairman of the petrochemicals company which has a big sport investment arm.

In a wide-ranging interview with BBC Sport earlier this month Ratcliffe addressed the side's recent struggles on the pitch, as they languish in the bottom third of the Premier League table. 

He said some Manchester United players are "not good enough" and some are "overpaid”.   Midfielder Casemiro, striker Rasmus Hojlund, goalkeeper Andre Onana, and wingers Antony and Jadon Sancho - who are on loan at other clubs - were name-checked by the billionaire as players his regime had "inherited".

Ratcliffe also spoke of the club's financial difficulties, saying it was set to run out of money by the end of 2025, unless it took action which he admitted was "unpopular". 

Yet despite the financial and team issues he referred to, Ratcliffe repeated a pledge that Manchester United would win silverware by 2028.

# Man Utd owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe says club “will come out fighting” | Extended interview | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q)
*  So Jim, good to see you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you for your time. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=1.36s)]
*  How would you describe your first year [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=3.0s)]
*  as co-owner of Manchester United? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=5.48s)]
*  Well, I think we are sort of roughly where [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=8.48s)]
*  we thought we would be. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=10.92s)]
*  But it's obviously been quite challenging, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=11.92s)]
*  because there's been a lot to do and quite a lot of issues [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=14.6s)]
*  in the club that we've needed to resolve. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=17.64s)]
*  You said it's kind of where you expect it to be. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=21.6s)]
*  But is the challenge facing you even greater [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=23.68s)]
*  than you anticipated? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=26.12s)]
*  I mean, the nature of the challenge [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=28.96s)]
*  is what we thought it would be. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=30.44s)]
*  But the scale of it probably is slightly bigger. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=32.8s)]
*  But I mean, we're sort of at the moment [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=34.92s)]
*  in the process of change. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=38.36s)]
*  Because United obviously has had 12... [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=40.92s)]
*  Since Alex or Alex retired in 2013, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=43.84s)]
*  the club's not performed at the level [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=48.04s)]
*  that's been expected of it. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  And there are reasons for that, clearly. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=51.64s)]
*  And I think unless you want that to continue, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=54.6s)]
*  there has to be a period of change. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=56.72s)]
*  And we're in the middle of a period of change [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=57.8s)]
*  at the moment. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=59.559999999999995s)]
*  You know, nobody likes change. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=61.36s)]
*  It's uncomfortable. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=62.599999999999994s)]
*  And we're in the midst of it. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=64.08s)]
*  You've said that you're aiming for the Premier League title [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=66.64s)]
*  again within three years, by 2028. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=68.92s)]
*  You've dubbed it Mission 21, a 21st title. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=71.67999999999999s)]
*  When you look at the table, does it [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=74.4s)]
*  seem like Mission Impossible rather than Mission 21 [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  right now? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=78.56s)]
*  No, I don't think it's Mission. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=79.96s)]
*  It's good to have goals and objectives. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=81.92s)]
*  And it's quite good to put a title, rather than just [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=83.64s)]
*  a bland statement that at some stage [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=86.80000000000001s)]
*  we're going to win the Premier League again. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=88.24000000000001s)]
*  I'm not Mystic Meg. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=90.56s)]
*  I don't have a magic wand. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=91.68s)]
*  I can't see into the future, obviously. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=93.16000000000001s)]
*  But I think if you look at Arsenal, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=95.08000000000001s)]
*  you look at Liverpool, you look at the period of time [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=97.24000000000001s)]
*  it took them to get the house in order [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=99.48s)]
*  and get back to winning ways, that's probably [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=101.68s)]
*  maybe slightly on the short end of the spectrum. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=104.88000000000001s)]
*  But it's not impossible. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=107.56s)]
*  But when you look at the table, you see yourself down in 14, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=109.04s)]
*  36 points behind Liverpool. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=112.16000000000001s)]
*  How does it make you feel? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=114.36000000000001s)]
*  It's obviously not where we would like to be. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=116.72s)]
*  But we are in a period of change. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=119.84s)]
*  We haven't had much time to change the squad. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=122.04s)]
*  We've got a new coach. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=127.04s)]
*  He came in mid-season. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=128.28s)]
*  And we've got a long list of injuries. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=131.0s)]
*  If I actually look at the squad that's available to Ruben, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=134.08s)]
*  I think he's doing a really good job, to be honest. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=137.56s)]
*  Have there been times over the past year, Jim, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=140.52s)]
*  where you've regretted investing in United? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=142.44s)]
*  Regretted the transaction? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=146.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=148.16s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=148.64s)]
*  No. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=149.32s)]
*  No, I think I didn't expect it to be a walk in the park. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=149.84s)]
*  It's quite tough sometimes reading the press, obviously. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=155.8s)]
*  But in a way, I'd rather the press had a go at me [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=158.76s)]
*  than Ruben, the coach. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=162.44s)]
*  People are entitled to their opinions. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=165.36s)]
*  But in my view, I think we are on the trajectory [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=167.84s)]
*  that I thought we would be on. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=170.88s)]
*  We're in a process of change at the moment. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=173.0s)]
*  We put a new management team in place. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=174.79999999999998s)]
*  We didn't get that all right at the beginning, obviously. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=177.6s)]
*  But I think today we've got a very good management team [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=180.44s)]
*  in place. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=182.24s)]
*  We were dealing with the financial issues in the club, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=182.84s)]
*  because the club has got financial issues, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=186.24s)]
*  and we need to address those. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=187.96s)]
*  You mentioned criticism. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  There's been criticism as well from the media, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=190.32s)]
*  but from fans, too. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=193.44s)]
*  You'll have seen the protests before the match [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=194.6s)]
*  against Arsenal. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=196.48s)]
*  Do you understand those fans' anger? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=197.72s)]
*  Yeah, and I sympathise with them, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=200.4s)]
*  because Manchester United is not where it's expected to be. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=204.16s)]
*  We're expected to be winning the Premier League [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=207.8s)]
*  and challenging for the Champions League. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=210.4s)]
*  And we're not there at the moment. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=212.52s)]
*  But I think we need to get the house back in order [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  before we can get back to our winning ways. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=218.08s)]
*  And that's a process. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=220.20000000000002s)]
*  It's not a light switch. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=223.28s)]
*  I mean, if you look at, just to give you an example, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=225.16s)]
*  if you look at the players that we're buying this summer, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=227.36s)]
*  that we didn't buy, we're buying Anthony, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=230.76000000000002s)]
*  we're buying Casemiro, we're buying Inano, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=236.20000000000002s)]
*  we're buying Hoyland, we're buying Sancho. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=238.44000000000003s)]
*  These are all things from the past, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=243.64000000000001s)]
*  but we're not where we've inherited those things, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=245.20000000000002s)]
*  or we have to sort that out. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=248.76000000000002s)]
*  So for Sancho, who now obviously plays for Chelsea, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  and we pay half his wages, we're paying £17 million [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=252.76000000000002s)]
*  to buy in the summer. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=255.16000000000003s)]
*  So it takes time for us to move away from the past [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=256.72s)]
*  into a new place in the future. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=261.20000000000005s)]
*  To what extent are you still dealing [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=265.6s)]
*  with the problems of the past? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=267.76000000000005s)]
*  Or after a year, though, is this on you to some extent now? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=268.84000000000003s)]
*  Manchester United would have run out of cash by the end [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=272.96000000000004s)]
*  of this year, by the end of 2025, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=276.68s)]
*  after me having put $300 million in. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=280.24s)]
*  And if we buy no new players in the summer, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=283.56s)]
*  if we hadn't implemented all the cost programmes [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=286.91999999999996s)]
*  and restructurings that we have done over the last 12 months, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=291.4s)]
*  I do feel sympathy with the fans, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=295.28s)]
*  but I'm not actually surprised at where we are in the league, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=296.88s)]
*  because Rubens only got a certain size of squad he can do. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=302.2s)]
*  I mean, quite a number of those players [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=305.12s)]
*  are either injured or they're not available to him. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=306.88s)]
*  Do you accept that you've contributed [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=309.2s)]
*  to the predicament that the club finds itself? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=311.76s)]
*  We're not perfect, and we're on a journey. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=316.12s)]
*  And there have been a couple of errors along the way. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=318.56s)]
*  But I think in the main, all the things that we're doing [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=321.52s)]
*  are the right things for the club. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=324.03999999999996s)]
*  And the club's going to finish up [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=325.44s)]
*  in a very, very different place in three years time [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=327.2s)]
*  to where it's been in the past, in my view. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=329.03999999999996s)]
*  I think it will become the most profitable club in the world. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=330.88s)]
*  In three years time, Manchester United will be. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=334.71999999999997s)]
*  That will be my prediction for Manchester. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=336.84s)]
*  It will become the most profitable club in the world. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=338.4s)]
*  I think we may well finish up with the most iconic football [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=340.64s)]
*  stadium in the world. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=345.15999999999997s)]
*  And I think we will finish up winning Silverware again. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=346.52s)]
*  But I think if we were to build the most iconic football [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=350.0s)]
*  stadium in the world, which I think we will do, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=353.08s)]
*  then that will attract the billion fans we've [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=356.08s)]
*  got around the world. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=359.8s)]
*  They'll all want to come to Manchester. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=361.52s)]
*  One of the reasons the fans were protesting [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=363.59999999999997s)]
*  was over ticket price increases. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=365.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=367.15999999999997s)]
*  Explain again why you had to do that. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=368.47999999999996s)]
*  My general principles on ticket pricing should be fair. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=370.36s)]
*  It should be affordable for the people in Manchester. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=372.76s)]
*  And we do need to look after the under 16s [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=375.92s)]
*  and the older people who don't have as much money. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=378.68s)]
*  But at the same time, ticket income [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=381.96s)]
*  is a part of the overall income of the club. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=384.84s)]
*  Are there likely to be more increases for season tickets [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=387.15999999999997s)]
*  next season? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=389.71999999999997s)]
*  I think there will be some modest price increases. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=390.6s)]
*  And I think we will try to hold the under 16 tickets [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=393.88s)]
*  at the prices that they saw last season. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=400.0s)]
*  It's not just the ticket price increases, is it, Jim? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=402.36s)]
*  It's also the cost cutting that you've instigated. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=405.0s)]
*  And obviously, there's been hundreds of redundancies last [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=408.52s)]
*  year and hundreds more to come. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=410.64s)]
*  Again, why is there a need to do that? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=413.71999999999997s)]
*  I mean, the simple answer is the club runs out of money [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=416.08s)]
*  at Christmas if we don't do those things. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=418.32s)]
*  But ultimately, if you look at running a club the size [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=421.2s)]
*  of Manchester United with income of about 650 million pounds, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=424.44s)]
*  you spend a part of that 650 on operating the club [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=428.47999999999996s)]
*  and a part of it on the squad. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=431.64s)]
*  Where do you want to spend the money? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=433.2s)]
*  Do you want to spend it on operating the club [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=434.56s)]
*  or do you want to spend it on the squad? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=435.88s)]
*  Is there a danger that you cross the line between efficiency [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=437.35999999999996s)]
*  and ruthlessness that potentially could [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=441.4s)]
*  take the land of United? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=444.24s)]
*  Well, I know I don't enjoy reading the newspaper very much [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=446.08s)]
*  these days, I have to say. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=448.88s)]
*  But I think I know it's unpopular. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=449.88s)]
*  This period of change is uncomfortable for people. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=457.04s)]
*  And some of the decisions we have to make are unpleasant. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=459.48s)]
*  But they are necessary. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=462.40000000000003s)]
*  Some would say, well, if we haven't kept Eric Tenhag [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=463.84000000000003s)]
*  and backed him to the tune of 200 million pounds [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=468.40000000000003s)]
*  in the summer and then sacked him a few weeks later, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=470.64000000000004s)]
*  if we hadn't paid millions to secure Dan Ashworth [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=474.20000000000005s)]
*  and then let him go a few months after he started, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=478.28000000000003s)]
*  this is tens of millions of pounds worth of compensation [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=481.20000000000005s)]
*  cost that we've racked up. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=483.68s)]
*  Probably 20 million, yeah. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=484.72s)]
*  Maybe we wouldn't need to cut as many jobs, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=486.04s)]
*  cut these perks, raise ticket prices. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=488.36s)]
*  But also remember, I put $300 million [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=491.88s)]
*  into the club in January, and that's all gone. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=496.36s)]
*  So yeah, I agree. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=501.0s)]
*  Eric Tenhag, the Dan Ashworth decisions were errors. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=503.0s)]
*  I think there were some mitigating circumstances, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=506.16s)]
*  but ultimately they were errors. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=509.88s)]
*  I accept that, and I apologize for that. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=513.04s)]
*  But at the end of the day, we have to get the fundamentals [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=516.64s)]
*  right in the club. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=518.76s)]
*  The Dan Ashworth situation, you told me last February [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=519.6s)]
*  this is somebody best in the world at what they do. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=525.12s)]
*  You were prepared to wait a long time to secure his services. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=526.9200000000001s)]
*  And then he spent around as much time on gardening leave [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=529.6s)]
*  as he actually did in the job before you went [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=533.32s)]
*  your separate ways. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=535.72s)]
*  Can you explain what exactly went wrong there? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=536.5600000000001s)]
*  No, it was an error on our part. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=539.28s)]
*  And all I would say is chemistry, really. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=543.84s)]
*  I don't really want to go into the details. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=546.68s)]
*  I think we are where we are. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=550.04s)]
*  We've moved on, the chemistry issue. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=551.64s)]
*  And with Eric, it's been suggested that you, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=554.08s)]
*  after the club finished eighth last season, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=558.32s)]
*  were keen to make a change, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=561.72s)]
*  but others perhaps felt differently. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=563.4s)]
*  Is that the case? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=565.16s)]
*  Can you explain to me, light on that at all? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=566.0s)]
*  It was a very difficult decision to make at short notice. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=568.2s)]
*  And also, it's quite difficult to extract Eric [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=572.8s)]
*  from Eric's performance in the previous season [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=575.28s)]
*  from the management team he had been working with [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=578.3199999999999s)]
*  in the previous. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=580.68s)]
*  If I look today, there's a great relationship [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=581.52s)]
*  between Ruben and Jason. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=585.28s)]
*  Jason Wilcox, the sporting director. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=587.1199999999999s)]
*  And Jason gives Ruben a lot of support. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=589.16s)]
*  But Eric didn't benefit from that. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=592.04s)]
*  It's quite difficult to understand in that previous season [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=594.0799999999999s)]
*  to what extent Eric maybe wasn't performing as we'd hoped, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=596.7199999999999s)]
*  or it was the circumstances [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=600.68s)]
*  in which Eric was trying to perform. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=602.1999999999999s)]
*  And we couldn't get to the bottom of that problem. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=604.0799999999999s)]
*  It became clearer, obviously, three months later. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=606.68s)]
*  And we got it wrong, but we've moved on. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=609.8s)]
*  I think we've corrected it, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=613.9599999999999s)]
*  and we're in a very different place today. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=614.92s)]
*  You said earlier, we don't mind people making mistakes [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=617.7199999999999s)]
*  at Ineos, but try not to make the same mistake twice. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=620.56s)]
*  Do you accept that those two episodes, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=624.04s)]
*  10 Hrg Ashworth, given the cost of it, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=626.04s)]
*  has called into question Ineos's decision-making at United? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=630.04s)]
*  And do you feel confident that you've learned [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=633.84s)]
*  from those experiences sufficiently? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=635.52s)]
*  Yeah, no, we have. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=637.52s)]
*  I mean, there's no question we've learned. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=638.36s)]
*  I hope we don't make those types of mistakes again. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=639.44s)]
*  But one needs to be careful we don't just focus [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=642.36s)]
*  on two things at once, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=645.64s)]
*  because there are many things that we've done [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=648.12s)]
*  which I think are going quite well. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=649.44s)]
*  Has it got to a stage with Ruben [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=651.04s)]
*  where you just have to stick with him now, come what may, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=652.88s)]
*  and see it long-term? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=655.68s)]
*  It's not that I have to stick with Ruben. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=656.52s)]
*  I think Ruben is an outstanding young manager. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=657.36s)]
*  I really do. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=660.12s)]
*  I think he's an excellent manager [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=660.96s)]
*  and I think he'll be there for a long time. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=662.44s)]
*  But he's lost 10 matches in 25 or so games. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=663.76s)]
*  I mean, you're down to 14th. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=667.16s)]
*  This is historically bad. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=668.16s)]
*  Decades have passed since United were in that position. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=669.84s)]
*  The squad he's got at his disposal [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=672.76s)]
*  with the injury list he's got at his disposal. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=675.2s)]
*  And he comes in mid-season where he's had no time [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=677.92s)]
*  to train the players in his style of play. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=681.12s)]
*  I think he's done really well. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=683.36s)]
*  How much money will he have to spend [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=685.16s)]
*  in the summer to reinforce the squad [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=686.76s)]
*  and get the players he needs to play in the way he wants to? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=688.64s)]
*  Or does that depend on selling players as well? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=690.6800000000001s)]
*  There will be a budget for him [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=693.08s)]
*  and I'm not going to reveal that. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=694.24s)]
*  But obviously that budget changes depending upon [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=695.72s)]
*  who we may choose to sell [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=699.0400000000001s)]
*  because that will supplement the budget. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=700.48s)]
*  What did you make of the hard line stance [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=702.08s)]
*  he took with Marcus Rashford? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=703.96s)]
*  Did that have your support? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=705.48s)]
*  Yep. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=706.9200000000001s)]
*  And why was that stance taken? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=707.84s)]
*  Because he wants a dressing room [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=710.44s)]
*  that is full of people [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=714.32s)]
*  who are totally committed to winning football matches. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=718.2s)]
*  You mentioned some of the players [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=723.28s)]
*  that I think Ineos have inherited effectively, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=724.48s)]
*  the likes of Anthony and Hoyland and Ana Casemiro. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=726.24s)]
*  Are you saying that those players aren't good enough for United? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=730.72s)]
*  No, I'm not saying... [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=734.2s)]
*  I'm just saying that we've... [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=735.2s)]
*  Or overpaid? What are you getting out there? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=736.2s)]
*  Well, some are not good enough. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=738.32s)]
*  Some probably are overpaid. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=740.9200000000001s)]
*  But for us to mould the squad [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=742.72s)]
*  that we are fully responsible for and accountable for [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=747.0400000000001s)]
*  will take time. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=750.24s)]
*  And despite the struggles this season, this year, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=751.24s)]
*  I sense that you're even more determined than ever [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=753.36s)]
*  to reverse this decline [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=755.52s)]
*  and get the club back to where it needs to be. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=759.2s)]
*  Do you want that to be your legacy ultimately, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=761.12s)]
*  what you're remembered for? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=763.32s)]
*  You know, and I recognise that I'm unpopular at the moment. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=764.5600000000001s)]
*  But I am prepared to be [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=767.52s)]
*  and I can deal with being unpopular for a period of time. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=770.1600000000001s)]
*  Because I believe that what we're doing is the right thing [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=773.56s)]
*  and will get us... [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=777.6s)]
*  I mean, Manchester United has come off the rails. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=778.6s)]
*  We need to get it back on the rails. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=781.6s)]
*  And I believe what we're doing, we'll put it back on the rails [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=783.6s)]
*  and we'll finish up, you know, being where Liverpool are today [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=786.12s)]
*  or where Real Madrid are today in the future. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=790.84s)]
*  You know, we need to stick together at the moment [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=793.64s)]
*  through this difficult period. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=795.36s)]
*  And, you know, when the going gets tough, you know, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=796.64s)]
*  people need to stick with it. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=803.12s)]
*  They need to show a bit of grit and resilience, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=804.96s)]
*  don't wilt and come out the other side fighting. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=806.64s)]
*  And that's what we will do. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjP6Qf1Sd8Q&t=809.64s)]
