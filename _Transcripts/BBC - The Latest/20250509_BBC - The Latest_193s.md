Video Description: President Vladimir Putin has led Russia's Victory Day commemorations with a parade in Red Square and heightened security after days of Ukrainian strikes targeting the capital.
 
Chinese President Xi Jinping joined Putin as he told thousands of soldiers and more than 20 international leaders that Russia remembered the lessons of World War Two.
 
The Russian leader used his speech to tie the war to today's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and said all of Russia was behind what he called the "special military operation" - now well into its fourth year.

*  writing on social media he said he was committed to securing a lasting peace. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UdN8ThVHDE&t=65.44s)]
*  Mr Trump's message comes after he held a phone call with Ukraine's President Volodymyr [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UdN8ThVHDE&t=70.24s)]
*  Zelensky who said Kiev is ready for the ceasefire starting this minute and that it would be [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UdN8ThVHDE&t=74.19999999999999s)]
*  a real indicator of movement towards peace. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UdN8ThVHDE&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  Meanwhile, in Ukraine itself, fighting has continued with authorities there saying Russia [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UdN8ThVHDE&t=82.6s)]
*  continues to attack across the entire front despite an order from President Putin for [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UdN8ThVHDE&t=87.28s)]
*  a three-day ceasefire. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UdN8ThVHDE&t=92.72s)]
*  For its part, Russia accuses Ukraine of trying to make new incursions in the Kursk region. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UdN8ThVHDE&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  Earlier on, our security correspondent Frank Gardner, who's in Kiev, told us more about [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UdN8ThVHDE&t=100.91999999999999s)]
*  where the ceasefire is holding and where it isn't. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UdN8ThVHDE&t=105.72s)]
*  It's really a ceasefire in two parts because where it is largely holding is over the skies [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UdN8ThVHDE&t=109.24s)]
*  here in Kiev and other major cities where in previous nights there have been absolute [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UdN8ThVHDE&t=114.47999999999999s)]
*  waves of Russian-scented drones coming across, occasionally ballistic missiles, anti-aircraft [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UdN8ThVHDE&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  defence engaging them. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UdN8ThVHDE&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  That hasn't happened for the last two nights. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UdN8ThVHDE&t=128.76s)]
*  So in terms of the air activity over most of Ukraine, the ceasefire is being observed. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UdN8ThVHDE&t=131.12s)]
*  There have been a couple of exceptions in Poltava and Kherson. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UdN8ThVHDE&t=138.24s)]
*  But where the ceasefire is most definitely not working is on the front line. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UdN8ThVHDE&t=141.60000000000002s)]
*  And it's a big front line, remember. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UdN8ThVHDE&t=146.56s)]
*  It's more than 1,000 kilometres long, but there are exchanges of artillery, of mortar [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UdN8ThVHDE&t=147.88s)]
*  fire, of glide bombs. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UdN8ThVHDE&t=152.68s)]
*  Ukraine a few hours ago accused Russia of launching nearly 100 glide bombs. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UdN8ThVHDE&t=155.24s)]
*  These are old-fashioned Soviet heavy dumb bombs that are fitted with fins and GPS guidance [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UdN8ThVHDE&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  systems that are then launched often from the Russian side of the border and aimed across [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UdN8ThVHDE&t=166.95999999999998s)]
*  the border at targets inside Ukraine. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UdN8ThVHDE&t=171.76s)]
*  So Ukraine was never particularly optimistic that this ceasefire would be a full ceasefire. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UdN8ThVHDE&t=174.83999999999997s)]
*  They've called it a smoke break. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UdN8ThVHDE&t=181.64s)]
*  They want a full 30-day comprehensive ceasefire on land, sea and air, which America backs [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UdN8ThVHDE&t=184.64s)]
*  but Russia will not sign up to. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UdN8ThVHDE&t=190.67999999999998s)]
