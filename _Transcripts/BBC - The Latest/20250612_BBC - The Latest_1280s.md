*  city of Umbad, hitting a hostel for trainee doctors. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=15.32s)]
*  Of those on board, the Boeing Dreamliner 787-53 were British nationals. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=19.32s)]
*  Miraculously one passenger, a British man, has survived and was able to walk away. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=25.4s)]
*  We'll hear from his family tonight. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=30.599999999999998s)]
*  The flight took off at 1.40pm local time on a 10-hour flight to Gatwick. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=33.48s)]
*  It was only 600 feet or so in the air when it came down less than a minute later. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=39.64s)]
*  The number of victims on the ground is still unknown. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  What caused it to crash is still unclear. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=48.12s)]
*  We'll piece together what we know. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=50.44s)]
*  And tonight we'll hear from our correspondent, Yogita Limai, who's at the scene of the crash, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=53.24s)]
*  and Samira Hussain at the local hospital. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=57.24s)]
*  First let's join Yogita at the site of the crash. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  Rita, an acrid smell of burning rubber, wood, plastic, hangs thick in the air here at the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=66.48s)]
*  crash site. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=73.16s)]
*  The buildings that you can see behind me completely charred and there's a row of those leading [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=74.56s)]
*  right up to the place where the aircraft actually crashed. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=80.11999999999999s)]
*  It's been cordoned off now, but we were there earlier and literally we were walking through [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=84.39999999999999s)]
*  charred pieces of metal along the way. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=89.16s)]
*  We saw bodies that were being pulled out, parts of rubble that were still smoking, parts [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=91.96s)]
*  of rubble that were still on fire. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=97.25999999999999s)]
*  And we still don't know how many people who were in this densely residential area, populated [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=100.6s)]
*  area, were killed in that crash. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=106.36s)]
*  And here is how events unfolded today. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=109.6s)]
*  It was meant to be a nine hour journey, a plane carrying hundreds of passengers, hundreds [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=116.36s)]
*  of dreams. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=121.47999999999999s)]
*  But just after takeoff, and in what must have been terrifying moments for those on board, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  this flight made a frantic May Day call. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=128.64s)]
*  But when air traffic control responded, silence followed by a deafening explosion. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=131.95999999999998s)]
*  All of it caught on camera. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=137.79999999999998s)]
*  The plane crashed just outside the airport complex on buildings used as accommodation [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=143.6s)]
*  by medical students at a government college and hospital. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=148.83999999999997s)]
*  Firefighters and emergency responders were rushed in. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=154.76s)]
*  Tackling the blaze caused by a plane tank full of fuel, not an easy task. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=158.23999999999998s)]
*  Many locals ran in to help. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=164.16s)]
*  We met one of them later in the day. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=166.4s)]
*  Ravi Vacheta described what he saw. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=168.32000000000002s)]
*  I heard a loud explosion. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=172.68s)]
*  Then I went to the spot and saw smoke blowing out. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=174.88000000000002s)]
*  We went in with the emergency response team and helped to pull the bodies out. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  Everything was charred. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  It was very difficult and the heat coming from it was intense. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=184.32000000000002s)]
*  Several hours after the crash, the wreckage was still smoking. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=189.88000000000002s)]
*  Looking into the night, rescuers pulled out more dead. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=194.2s)]
*  You can see there's a tree that has been upturned and is still smoking here. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=200.76s)]
*  And behind me, literally, everything is charred. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=204.4s)]
*  It's actually quite hard to even talk because the air is still smelling very acrid. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  It's still full of smoke. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=212.28s)]
*  I'm just going to try to walk around and show you the scale of the destruction there. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=213.56s)]
*  That's where the plane crashed. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=219.4s)]
*  But literally, there's a row of buildings about. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=220.76s)]
*  I've counted five or six of them that have been completely charred. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=223.84s)]
*  So the scale of devastation on the ground as well where the crash occurred, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=227.28s)]
*  the residential area where the crash occurred is just massive. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=231.24s)]
*  It's still unclear how many residents have died. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=237.64000000000001s)]
*  But Air India has said all passengers were killed except one person. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=240.48000000000002s)]
*  This British national who was on board the aircraft miraculously walked out alive. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=246.92000000000002s)]
*  He's being treated in hospital. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=253.0s)]
*  He's one of more than 50 British nationals who were on board the plane. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=256.6s)]
*  That was also carrying more than 160 Indians and Canadian and Portuguese nationals. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=260.40000000000003s)]
*  For families who had just seen their loved ones off at the airport, a gut-wrenching time. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=267.84000000000003s)]
*  My brother was on the plane, one man cries. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=275.76s)]
*  My sister-in-law was going to London. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=283.2s)]
*  Within an hour, I got news the plane had crashed. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=285.47999999999996s)]
*  I had left for Ahmedabad, then I came back. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=288.52s)]
*  We don't know anything. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=291.03999999999996s)]
*  We've not been able to enter the hospital. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=292.64s)]
*  First, we were forced to roam on the streets for an hour and a half. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=295.59999999999997s)]
*  They kept saying, stay here, don't stay here. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=299.88s)]
*  We have come to see our relatives, not to be sent around in circles. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=303.15999999999997s)]
*  Only three years ago, Air India became a private airline from being India's national carrier, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=307.4s)]
*  bought by an Indian business giant, the Tata Group. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=312.84s)]
*  At a time when it was trying to revamp its image to that of a polished, reliable airline, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=316.67999999999995s)]
*  this is a major trial for its leadership. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=321.79999999999995s)]
*  We are actively working with the authorities on all emergency response efforts. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=324.79999999999995s)]
*  A special team of caregivers from Air India is on their way to Ahmedabad to help them. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=330.67999999999995s)]
*  We are going to visit Ahmedabad to provide additional support. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=336.32s)]
*  Investigations will take time, but anything we can do now, we are doing. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=341.28s)]
*  The last deadly incident of this scale in India was also of an Air India plane, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=347.28s)]
*  which crashed in the southern city of Kaurikode five years ago. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=352.24s)]
*  For the carrier, there will be difficult questions to answer. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=356.96s)]
*  Yogita Lamaie, BBC News, Ahmedabad. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=361.68s)]
*  Vishwas Kumar Ramesh, he's the sole survivor of the crash, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=366.4s)]
*  and he's a 40-year-old businessman from Leicester. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=369.68s)]
*  And this is where he was sitting in seat 11A, near the front of the plane, ahead of the wings. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=373.08s)]
*  Vishwas is now being treated in hospital, but his brother Ajay was also on the plane, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=379.84s)]
*  and Air India says there were no other survivors. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=384.71999999999997s)]
*  Their family lives in Leicester. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=387.8s)]
*  Our correspondent Navtesh Johal has been talking to them. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=389.36s)]
*  The man believed to be the sole survivor. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=392.32000000000005s)]
*  Vishwas Kumar Ramesh miraculously appears to walk away from where so many have perished today. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=397.8s)]
*  He was on the flight from Ahmedabad to London with his brother Ajay. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=405.20000000000005s)]
*  This is him in hospital, where he's now being treated. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=409.48s)]
*  His remarkable escape has seen him visited in his bed by the Indian Minister of Home Affairs. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=414.40000000000003s)]
*  Back at his family home in Leicester, there was relief from one of his brothers upon seeing those images. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=420.84s)]
*  But concern remains about Ajay. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=427.12s)]
*  Obviously he feels great, doing well. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=430.52s)]
*  Fine, I guess. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=434.52s)]
*  He's just more worried about the other brother, that's all. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=436.04s)]
*  Tell me a little bit about your brothers. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=439.68s)]
*  I could just go on and on, I guess, all day. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=443.48s)]
*  There's no words to describe them, to be honest. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=446.92s)]
*  They were all in shock as soon as we heard what happened. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=450.56s)]
*  Just utter shock, that's all. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=453.56s)]
*  Speechless. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=456.56s)]
*  Vishwas has a wife and a young son. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=458.56s)]
*  He was born in India but has lived in the UK for more than 20 years. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=461.56s)]
*  This boarding pass shows that he was sat in seat 11A. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=465.56s)]
*  It was a window seat, located in the front half of the plane. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=469.56s)]
*  The family says Ajay was sat next to him. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=473.56s)]
*  Vishwas told his family he heard a blast from the aircraft. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=476.56s)]
*  What has Vishwas told you about what happened to him so far? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=480.56s)]
*  Honestly, he himself has no idea how he survived, how he got out of the plane. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=483.56s)]
*  When he called us, he was just more worried about my other brother. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=490.56s)]
*  Just find Ajay, find Ajay. That's all he cares about at the moment. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=493.56s)]
*  That's his concern, that's all he wants, is to find your brother. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=496.56s)]
*  He doesn't care about himself. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=498.56s)]
*  The family has been overwhelmed by support from relatives, neighbours and the wider community. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=501.56s)]
*  But they all fear the worst for Ajay. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=505.56s)]
*  Everyone is upset. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=508.56s)]
*  Ajay, how are you doing? This is your cousin who... [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=510.56s)]
*  I'm feeling absolutely upset. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=513.56s)]
*  He's not my cousin, he's also one of my best friends as well. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=515.56s)]
*  So I'm feeling upset. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=519.56s)]
*  The scenes outside this house in Leicester reflect a community in shock and grief. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=521.56s)]
*  This city is home to thousands of people with links to the state of Gujarat. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=526.56s)]
*  Here, this tragedy feels close to home. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=531.56s)]
*  Navtej Johal, BBC News, Leicester. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=534.56s)]
*  Well, we're learning more tonight about the people who died in the crash. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=538.56s)]
*  Among the 52 British people who lost their lives are Javid and Mariam Saeed from London, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=542.56s)]
*  who died alongside their two young children. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=548.56s)]
*  And Akhil Nanabawa and Hannah Varadji and their daughter Sarah from Gloucester. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=551.56s)]
*  Prayers have been held tonight for some of the victims. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=556.56s)]
*  Seema Kitecha reports. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=559.56s)]
*  Hindu prayers for the dead and the families who will never see their loved ones again. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=562.56s)]
*  Several members of this congregation knew someone on that fatal flight. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=569.56s)]
*  It's a really big loss for us and we all know the person. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=573.56s)]
*  I'm from Gujarat and my dad is just nearby. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=579.56s)]
*  We pray today. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=584.56s)]
*  There are hundreds of thousands of people of Gujarati heritage in the UK. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=591.56s)]
*  And this flight was coming from Gujarat. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=595.56s)]
*  But what the worshippers here have made clear is that this prayer is not just for one community. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=598.56s)]
*  It is for all the communities affected by this crash. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=602.56s)]
*  How did you know so much about this? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=606.56s)]
*  I was called in the morning. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=608.56s)]
*  The former Chief Minister of Gujarat Vijay Rupani was a close friend of the priest here [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=609.56s)]
*  and is believed to have been on the plane. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=614.56s)]
*  He gave us encouragement, always support to the Gujarati community. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=616.56s)]
*  It's very sad news. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=620.56s)]
*  In one family you lost one person, but the entire community you lost so many people. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=622.56s)]
*  How you can cope? And that's the reason we kept the prayers here. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=628.56s)]
*  We are at the airport just boarding. Goodbye India. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=632.56s)]
*  Others in their prayers. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=638.56s)]
*  A married couple, Jamie and Fingal Greenlaw Meek, who run a wellness and spiritual retreat in London. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=640.56s)]
*  This was their last Instagram post before their flight. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=646.56s)]
*  Also Javed Ali Sayed and Mariam Javed Ali Sayed. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=650.56s)]
*  They were killed along with their two children. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=655.56s)]
*  They lived in West London. Mariam had a job at Harrods and Javed worked at a West London hotel. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=657.56s)]
*  And Akhil Nannabhava and Hanna Varadji also died alongside their four-year-old daughter Sara, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=664.56s)]
*  who's been described as a ray of sunshine. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=671.56s)]
*  Tonight a sense of shared grief hangs heavily here, as people remember those so tragically lost, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=675.56s)]
*  4,000 miles away. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=682.56s)]
*  Sima Kitecha, BBC News. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=684.56s)]
*  The Prime Minister, Sakir Starmer, spoke in Downing Street this evening about the crash and its impact on people here. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=687.56s)]
*  Well, the images and news from India is absolutely devastating. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=694.56s)]
*  And I speak for the entire country in saying our thoughts are with each and every one of those involved. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=698.56s)]
*  There will be British and Indian families across the land who are absolutely impacted by this. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=704.56s)]
*  And our thoughts first and foremost are with them. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=710.56s)]
*  Obviously the investigation is going on. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=712.56s)]
*  We've dispatched an investigation team that's been deployed. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=714.56s)]
*  The Foreign Secretary is leading on this and we'll obviously update as soon as we can. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=718.56s)]
*  At least 50 injured medical students are being treated in hospital after the plane crashed into a doctor's hostel in the city. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=724.56s)]
*  Others were injured at the scene where the plane came down. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=731.56s)]
*  The bodies of the dead were taken to the civil hospital in Ahmedabad. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=735.56s)]
*  From where we can join Samira Hussain now. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=739.56s)]
*  Samira. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=741.56s)]
*  Rita, after the horror of the day, it is the grim reckoning of the night. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=745.56s)]
*  Things are pretty quiet here at the hospital as reality sets in. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=750.56s)]
*  This is no longer a search for survivors but the painstaking task of identifying the dead. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=754.56s)]
*  The rush to save survivors, the force of the crash and the explosion that followed most didn't stand a chance. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=765.56s)]
*  Sonal Ben's aunt and uncle were visiting from London. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=776.56s)]
*  We dropped her off and in just a few minutes we got the message to come to civil hospital. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=781.56s)]
*  Tulsi Bhai Bill saw the flames and ran towards the crash site. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=787.56s)]
*  We pulled out two, three bodies. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=794.56s)]
*  We ourselves got very scared. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=796.56s)]
*  When I was pulling out one of the bodies, a hand came into my hand. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=798.56s)]
*  We rushed the bodies to the hospital. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=803.56s)]
*  Several hours after the crash, people still searching for news. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=806.56s)]
*  But the rescue operation now officially over. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=811.56s)]
*  Everyone on that plane has died, save for just one person. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=815.56s)]
*  And so now the arduous task of identifying the bodies has begun. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=821.56s)]
*  So family members have all assembled here and they're coming to give DNA samples. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=825.56s)]
*  Because the bodies are so disfigured, the only way to be able to match people is by testing their DNA. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=831.56s)]
*  India's Home Minister says the true number of dead will take time. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=840.56s)]
*  We will give the official death toll after the DNA is taken and their identities have been confirmed by the authorities. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=847.56s)]
*  But even when all the dead have been accounted for, the grieving for them will only have just begun. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=853.56s)]
*  Terrible scenes there at the hospital. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=860.56s)]
*  But establishing the number of people who've died and exactly what happened is going to take time, isn't it? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=862.56s)]
*  Absolutely. What the hospital officials are saying here that it could take 72 hours for that DNA testing to be complete. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=870.56s)]
*  So family members are just left waiting to hear. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=880.56s)]
*  And of course, it's not just the people that were in the plane, that were on that plane, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=884.56s)]
*  but then there were also the people that were at the college that also need to be identified. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=889.56s)]
*  This is just a grueling time and I just want to sort of set the scene here. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=896.56s)]
*  You know, this is the main hospital where many of the bodies were brought. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=900.56s)]
*  And earlier today it was quite a scene. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=904.56s)]
*  There were so many people that were coming and it wasn't just family members and friends, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=907.56s)]
*  but it was just people in the community. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=911.56s)]
*  You have to understand that this is just such a horrific crash. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=913.56s)]
*  And so many people were just overcome with grief that they wanted to be here to offer their support. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=918.56s)]
*  People have been distributing water to people. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=924.56s)]
*  They've been offering food. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=927.56s)]
*  One man who operates a tea stall decided to close it down and just give out biscuits to all the people that have been working here. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=929.56s)]
*  It's a time where the community here is really trying to come together as officials are trying to figure out exactly what happened. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=936.56s)]
*  Samira, thank you. Samira Hussain reporting there. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=945.56s)]
*  Well, details of the plane's last moments and footage from the crash site are still emerging. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=948.56s)]
*  BBC verifies Merlin Thomas has been looking at what might have caused the crash. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=955.56s)]
*  The plane, a Boeing 7878 Dreamliner, takes off from a Metherbath airport at 1338 local time, bound for London Gatwick. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=960.56s)]
*  Tracking website FlightRadar24 shows the last location of flight tracking data at 625 feet altitude here. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=970.56s)]
*  We showed experts the footage who say that the plane appears to be pitching up to try to gain altitude. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=979.56s)]
*  And you can see its landing gear is down, when normally it would be retracted within 10 to 15 seconds of flight. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=985.56s)]
*  The crash site and its aftermath is just over one and a half kilometres from the end of the runway. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=993.56s)]
*  The tail of the plane is lodged in a building here. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=999.56s)]
*  It's part of the BJ Medical College. It's on the site of a hospital complex. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1004.56s)]
*  At least 50 medical students have been taken to hospital. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1009.56s)]
*  We know where this is because we've matched these buildings and aftermath to publicly available photos from the scene. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1012.56s)]
*  The Dreamliner 7878 has been in operation with Air India since 2014. So what could be the possible cause? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1018.56s)]
*  For some reason enough lift wasn't being generated to keep the aircraft climbing. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1027.56s)]
*  That's usually associated with not enough thrust for some reason or another. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1033.56s)]
*  But more than stating that would be to get into the realms of speculation. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1039.56s)]
*  Some experts told BBC Verify the plane's wing flaps didn't appear to be extended, which could be a factor which led to the crash. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1044.56s)]
*  Others say the video quality makes it too hard to tell. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1052.56s)]
*  The investigators will certainly look at the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder to determine if those flaps and slats were not extended or whether they were. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1056.56s)]
*  If it appeared to be an airplane issue or if it was a pilot issue and failure to set the flaps and slats where they should have. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1067.56s)]
*  Now investigators will hope to find the black box amongst the wreckage to piece together what happened. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1076.56s)]
*  Merlin Thomas, BBC News. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1082.56s)]
*  This is the first fatal accident involving a Boeing 787 passenger jet known as the Dreamliner. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1086.56s)]
*  Nick Marsh, our transport correspondent, is here with me. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1093.56s)]
*  And Nick, what sort of record does this type of aircraft have? What has Boeing said? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1097.56s)]
*  Well, until today, Rita, a very good record. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1101.56s)]
*  The 787 Dreamliner is a mainstay really of this kind of intercontinental travel. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1104.56s)]
*  I mean, it was only last month that Boeing was celebrating its billionth passenger on this type of aircraft. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1109.56s)]
*  You know, it just shows you how popular and how reliable it's been until now. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1116.56s)]
*  The issue is that when you have news like this, you hear the word Boeing, you hear crash. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1122.56s)]
*  You think of those fatal incidents in places like Indonesia, Ethiopia, where hundreds of people died. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1128.56s)]
*  Now that was Boeing's fault. That was faulty software, which was an issue. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1135.56s)]
*  And that's what caused those planes to go down. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1139.56s)]
*  Today is different, firstly, because those incidents involved a different model, the 737 Max. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1142.56s)]
*  This is the 787, completely different. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1147.56s)]
*  Secondly, and very importantly, as we've been hearing there in Merlin's report, we don't know what caused this crash. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1149.56s)]
*  There is no suggestion at all that Boeing, the manufacturer, really is to blame at all. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1155.56s)]
*  But in any case, it's Boeing again, its names being associated with bad news. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1160.56s)]
*  They've been losing so much money recently, and this is going to be another challenge for the company. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1164.56s)]
*  OK, thank you very much. Nick Marsh there. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1169.56s)]
*  Let's get a final word with our correspondent, Yogita Lemay, who's in Ahmedabad. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1172.56s)]
*  And Yogita, this is an accident with catastrophic consequences. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1177.56s)]
*  What will happen in the next hours and days? [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1181.56s)]
*  Well, for the next few hours, for the next few days, I think we're going to see the operation continue here. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1186.56s)]
*  And I'm going to show you why again, just to try to give you a sense of the scale. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1193.56s)]
*  So those burnt out buildings behind me, those are at least 500 meters from the crash site [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1197.56s)]
*  because this plane, which had a full fuel tank, crashed. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1203.56s)]
*  The flames that came in engulfed all of this. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1207.56s)]
*  There are earth movers here on standby. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1210.56s)]
*  The actual crash site is down this road. There are barricades here. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1213.56s)]
*  We can't go further at the moment. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1216.56s)]
*  But earlier today, we were able to get there. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1218.56s)]
*  And it's basically this whole row of buildings which were set ablaze, which are completely charred. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1221.56s)]
*  So this operation is going to take some time. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1227.56s)]
*  There are expectations here that Prime Minister Narendra Modi might be visiting, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1230.56s)]
*  although we don't have confirmation of that yet. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1235.56s)]
*  This is his home state of Gujarat. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1238.56s)]
*  But the biggest and most difficult questions, of course, for Air India, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1241.56s)]
*  it's announced compensation for the victims, roughly £86,000, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1245.56s)]
*  for the family of each person who was killed. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1249.56s)]
*  But difficult questions about what happened on that airplane. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1252.56s)]
*  And for a company that was trying to revamp its image, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1257.56s)]
*  that was trying to say it's a modern, new, sleek Air India, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1260.56s)]
*  it was privatized three years ago after being India's national carrier. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1264.56s)]
*  This, what's happened today, is going to come as a deadly, crushing blow. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1268.56s)]
*  Thank you. Yogi Talimai there, reporting from Ahmedabad. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seJzlq7k8RY&t=1275.56s)]
