# What a new Stalin statue says about Russia's attempt to reshape history | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtR7unv62Wg)
*  In Russia, not only do people not know what the future will hold, they don't know what [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtR7unv62Wg&t=0.0s)]
*  the past will hold. The past here is constantly changing. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtR7unv62Wg&t=13.700000000000001s)]
*  So I'm going down into the Moscow Metro because somewhere here, deep underground, a ghost [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtR7unv62Wg&t=23.62s)]
*  of Russia's past has reappeared. And there he is, Joseph Stalin, a brand new [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtR7unv62Wg&t=29.82s)]
*  statue of the Soviet dictator. Now there was a time after his death when all the Stalin [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtR7unv62Wg&t=44.3s)]
*  statues in Russia were removed, were knocked down, when Stalin's cult of personality and [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtR7unv62Wg&t=50.34s)]
*  his crimes against the people were officially condemned. The great terror, the millions [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtR7unv62Wg&t=56.96s)]
*  sent to the Gulag, the hundreds of thousands of people executed. But Stalin monuments have [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtR7unv62Wg&t=62.56s)]
*  been popping up again all over Russia. Today the authorities are focusing on Stalin the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtR7unv62Wg&t=67.28s)]
*  strongman, Stalin the victorious wartime leader. Stalin is being rehabilitated. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtR7unv62Wg&t=72.48s)]
*  What do young people today think about Stalin? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtR7unv62Wg&t=80.2s)]
*  Well, I think that Joseph Stalin is unfairly hated. He did a lot to our nation that we [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtR7unv62Wg&t=84.2s)]
*  still use. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtR7unv62Wg&t=94.72s)]
*  There was of course the Stalin terror and many people suffered in the Gulags. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtR7unv62Wg&t=99.08s)]
*  From this point of view, we cannot blame only Stalin because it was a system. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtR7unv62Wg&t=105.84s)]
*  But it's not just Joseph Stalin who's making a [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtR7unv62Wg&t=135.84s)]
*  comeback. So would you believe is the USSR. I'll explain how a little bit later. But [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtR7unv62Wg&t=165.68s)]
*  I mean the Soviet Union. It's long gone, right? It fell apart more than 30 years ago. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtR7unv62Wg&t=172.04000000000002s)]
*  There's even a museum dedicated to it here in the centre of Moscow. I've just been to [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtR7unv62Wg&t=177.72s)]
*  take a look. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtR7unv62Wg&t=182.8s)]
*  It's a real Aladdin's cave, or perhaps I should say Lenin's cave, full of the sights [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtR7unv62Wg&t=183.8s)]
*  and the sounds and even the smells of a country that has passed into history. And yet, just [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtR7unv62Wg&t=204.24s)]
*  a few days ago, one of President Putin's advisors suggested that legally the USSR [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtR7unv62Wg&t=210.32s)]
*  still exists because when it was being dissolved, allegedly there were procedural violations. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtR7unv62Wg&t=216.72s)]
*  And he said that to try to make out that Russia's war in Ukraine is an internal matter for Moscow. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtR7unv62Wg&t=223.72s)]
*  And then a former Russian prime minister came out and backed him up. Just over there by [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtR7unv62Wg&t=231.0s)]
*  some ultra-nationalists who agree and who want the Soviet Union back. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtR7unv62Wg&t=235.08s)]
*  I'm not saying we're definitely going to wake up one morning to find that the USSR is back. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtR7unv62Wg&t=266.08s)]
*  But it's interesting that the idea is being planted. And it's interesting too how the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtR7unv62Wg&t=289.88s)]
*  past is being reinterpreted, remoulded here under the influence of current events, the [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtR7unv62Wg&t=293.88s)]
*  war in Ukraine, confrontation with the West, the push for patriotism. Now Moscow accuses [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtR7unv62Wg&t=298.68s)]
*  the West all the time of rewriting history. What's happening here does feel like an attempt [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtR7unv62Wg&t=304.88s)]
*  by the Russian authorities to reshape the past, to try to justify the present. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtR7unv62Wg&t=311.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtR7unv62Wg&t=323.88s)]
