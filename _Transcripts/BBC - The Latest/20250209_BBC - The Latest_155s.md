*  And there have also been emotional scenes in Thailand after five farm workers who were abducted [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4F0OO_cnoc&t=0.0s)]
*  during the 7th of October attacks have returned home 10 days after they were released. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4F0OO_cnoc&t=5.44s)]
*  All the five men were greeted by relatives at Bangkok airport and they spent nearly 500 days [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4F0OO_cnoc&t=10.96s)]
*  in captivity. Nearly all of the foreign workers abducted during the attack were Thais. Israel [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4F0OO_cnoc&t=16.4s)]
*  employs some 30,000 of them as farm laborers making them one of the largest migrant groups [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4F0OO_cnoc&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  in the country. Thai's foreign minister thanked all of those involved in securing their release [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4F0OO_cnoc&t=28.08s)]
*  saying that Thailand had never given up hope. Our South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4F0OO_cnoc&t=33.04s)]
*  was there as the hostages arrived home in Bangkok. So the long ordeal of the five Thai farm workers [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4F0OO_cnoc&t=38.16s)]
*  is now over after they arrived back this morning here at Bangkok's main international airport [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4F0OO_cnoc&t=46.4s)]
*  giving a traditional Thai greeting to waiting reporters. For some there was then an emotional [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4F0OO_cnoc&t=52.16s)]
*  reunion with their families. They have been held for the past 10 days in an Israeli hospital while [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4F0OO_cnoc&t=58.0s)]
*  their health has been checked but it does appear to be remarkably good unlike many of the Israeli [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4F0OO_cnoc&t=64.88s)]
*  hostages after their 480 days being held by Hamas and under that intense Israeli bombardment of Gaza. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4F0OO_cnoc&t=71.44s)]
*  Now until the agreement between Israel and Hamas last month the Thai government had no idea that [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4F0OO_cnoc&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  these men were still alive. Thailand had been negotiating from the start using intermediaries [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4F0OO_cnoc&t=87.44s)]
*  like Iran and Qatar for the release of the 31 Thais who were abducted in that Hamas attack. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4F0OO_cnoc&t=93.6s)]
*  23 were freed within just a few weeks but there have been almost no news about the remaining six [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4F0OO_cnoc&t=100.4s)]
*  who were still alive or believed to be alive in the past year until last month that they heard [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4F0OO_cnoc&t=107.52s)]
*  these five were going to be freed along with the first groups of Israeli hostages. There is still [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4F0OO_cnoc&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  one Thai man from the northeast who's still missing. Now in the immediate aftermath of the Hamas attack [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4F0OO_cnoc&t=119.92s)]
*  thousands of Thais who go to Israel every year to work on the farms there they're very much a [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4F0OO_cnoc&t=125.92s)]
*  backbone of the Israeli agricultural economy came back here worried about their safety but many of [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4F0OO_cnoc&t=131.28s)]
