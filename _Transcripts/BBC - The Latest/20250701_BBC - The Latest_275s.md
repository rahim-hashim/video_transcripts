Video Description: Spain had its hottest June on record as scorching temperatures continue to grip Europe.
National weather service Aemet said the country's "extremely hot" June 2025 "has pulverised records", and surpassed the normal average for July and August.
Parts of Spain and Portugal recorded their highest ever June temperatures, with 46C registered at El Granado in south-west Spain, a day after records were broken in Mora in central Portugal.
Elsewhere on the continent on Tuesday, tens of thousands of people have been evacuated because of wildfires in western Turkey, while two people died in Italy following separate heat-related deaths.

**BBC - The Latest:** [July 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM)
*  The heat wave that has gripped large parts of Europe is showing no signs of abating. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=0.0s)]
*  Health warnings are still in place across many countries. Two people have died in Italy [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=4.88s)]
*  now as the temperatures continue to soar there. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=8.72s)]
*  We can show you again the scene in Rome. The very famous Spanish Steps sweltering there [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=12.48s)]
*  in Rome today is set to endure for at least another 10 days, with Italy's health ministry [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=18.2s)]
*  placing 16 cities under its highest heat alert. France has read alerts in places across six [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=23.36s)]
*  regions including Paris. There's the Eiffel Tower. Well, the top of it today, it's too [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=29.44s)]
*  hot up there. That has been closed to tourists. And in the last few minutes, Spain's Weather [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=33.28s)]
*  Service has confirmed the country has had its hottest June ever, with temperatures there [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=38.72s)]
*  expected to remain above 40 degrees for the next couple of days. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=43.6s)]
*  Let's find out more now. We can join our correspondents Guy Hedgego in Madrid and [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=48.32s)]
*  Anna Holligan, who joins us now from Cagden, which is a seaside area near The Hague. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=52.96s)]
*  Anna, I'm going to start with you as people swim behind you. I was in the Netherlands [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=58.4s)]
*  last week wearing five layers of clothes. I was absolutely freezing, so it is remarkable [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  to see you there on the beach with people swimming. How have the Dutch been dealing with the heat? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=67.6s)]
*  It sounds like you chose the wrong week to be here. The temperatures have absolutely soared [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  over the last couple of days. I'm actually speaking to you from, I'm standing in the North Sea, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  in fact, in Cagden, just on the edge of The Hague. It's relatively quiet here because I'm on the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=84.48s)]
*  edge of a nudist beach, but I'm just going to spin the camera around in the other direction [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=90.0s)]
*  to show you, as far as the eye can see, parasols. People have escaped the sweltering heat of the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=95.04s)]
*  city to find some rest right here on the beach. And up at the beach bars, they're offering free [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=103.2s)]
*  sun cream. So measures are being taken. A code yellow weather warning is in place for the entire [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=110.64s)]
*  country. Code orange in three provinces. Garbage collectors and construction workers started work [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=116.56s)]
*  early. A tropical heat plan is in place for schools, so some of them are finishing early. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=123.84s)]
*  After school sports activities have been cancelled or postponed. The annual National Slavery [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=128.96s)]
*  Memorial Keti Koti was also moved to earlier in the day. So really, really sweltering temperatures [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=135.44s)]
*  here around 30, 35, 36 degrees, reaching up to 39 degrees in some parts of the country. So yes, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=143.04s)]
*  these people behind me here in the North Sea, they absolutely have the right idea. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=151.44s)]
*  Guy, I'm sure you're envious that Anna has her feet in the nice, cold North Sea there as you [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=156.64s)]
*  swelter in Madrid. Before we come to you with the situation in Spain, I've just had an alert from [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=161.28s)]
*  Portugal. They have also registered their highest June temperature, 46.6 degrees Celsius in Portugal. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=166.32s)]
*  So the Iberian Peninsula also incredibly hot. What have the meteorological services had to say [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=173.44s)]
*  about the month of June, though, overall? Well, we were expecting the Spanish meteorological [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=179.67999999999998s)]
*  agency to confirm that this was the hottest June on record. They said that a few days ago. That was [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=188.8s)]
*  before the heat wave even began. They said it already looked like being the hottest June on record. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=194.64000000000001s)]
*  That has obviously turned out to be the case. On Saturday, we had that temperature recorded down [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=199.36s)]
*  in El Granado in the south of the country of 46 degrees Celsius. That was the hottest temperature [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=204.96s)]
*  ever recorded in June as well. So everything has been pointing towards records being broken. And [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=212.08s)]
*  we saw another record broken in Barcelona yesterday. Barcelona had its hottest day ever in June, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=218.0s)]
*  37.4 degrees Celsius. So now we're going, we're coming into July. So the business is normal. I [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=223.28s)]
*  think people are expecting the temperatures to remain extremely high. I think the thing about [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=230.64s)]
*  this heat wave is that it's come so early. That has rather taken people by surprise. But the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=236.4s)]
*  recommendations, the information we're getting from the authorities is the kind of information [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=244.4s)]
*  we would normally be getting in the middle of July or middle of August. I just stay out of the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=248.56s)]
*  heat during this time of day, drink water, elderly people, people with underlying health conditions [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=252.72s)]
*  need to be particularly careful. All of that sort of information, it's been coming several weeks [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=258.8s)]
*  earlier than people would normally expect. Guy, we'll let you get into the shade. Thank you so [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=263.36s)]
*  much. Anna, I think you should stick to the right side of the beach, as it were. But good to see you [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=268.8s)]
*  as well and stay cool. Thank you. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMKMC5GxDM&t=273.44s)]
