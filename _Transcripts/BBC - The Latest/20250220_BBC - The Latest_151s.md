Video Description: A huge sinkhole in a street in Surrey, UK has caused the county council to declare a major incident.
 
The original hole first appeared in Godstone High Street late on Monday night, growing to at least 65ft (20m) long by Tuesday lunchtime.
 
Families have been evacuated from their homes over fears of an explosion caused by exposed cables, with one resident saying the street now "sounded like a waterfall".
 
Once councillor said the sinkhole could prevent people from returning home for months.

# Huge sinkhole in Surrey swallows up more of street | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW_gPtuFN-o)
*  We're back here. Investigations are continuing into the cause of a giant sinkhole that's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW_gPtuFN-o&t=0.0s)]
*  opened up in a Surrey village. The 65 foot or 20 metre long hole has swallowed up much [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW_gPtuFN-o&t=5.28s)]
*  of a main road in Godstone. People evacuated from 30 homes nearby have not been told when [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW_gPtuFN-o&t=12.4s)]
*  they can return. Tom Simons reports. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW_gPtuFN-o&t=18.52s)]
*  It appeared late on Monday night. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW_gPtuFN-o&t=21.98s)]
*  We can see the water just starting to come out. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW_gPtuFN-o&t=24.96s)]
*  There was no hole there at the time. And then 20 minutes later we find out that we've got [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW_gPtuFN-o&t=27.86s)]
*  no water and that massive wave of cold had come. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW_gPtuFN-o&t=33.42s)]
*  Then we got a massive knock on the door and the buzzer was just going off frantically. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW_gPtuFN-o&t=35.9s)]
*  And I thought at first you wonder what it is. Is it a prank? Who is it? And it was the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW_gPtuFN-o&t=39.7s)]
*  police just telling us that we had to leave immediately in case of an explosion because [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW_gPtuFN-o&t=45.260000000000005s)]
*  the pipes were all crossed with each other. And then we had to just get what we couldn't [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW_gPtuFN-o&t=50.18s)]
*  and leave. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW_gPtuFN-o&t=54.739999999999995s)]
*  And now Godstone, a lively Surrey village, is split in two by this gaping sinkhole, 65 [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW_gPtuFN-o&t=56.559999999999995s)]
*  feet long. A whole section of the village is cordoned off and people living in 30 flats [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW_gPtuFN-o&t=62.959999999999994s)]
*  and houses have had to leave. Some are in hotels or staying with relatives. Some residents [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW_gPtuFN-o&t=67.88s)]
*  have had trouble getting help from their house insurers. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW_gPtuFN-o&t=74.12s)]
*  It's a big hole and it was growing at the time and I think it's no fault of their own [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW_gPtuFN-o&t=77.44s)]
*  that they're in these circumstances. And for me it's a very clear event that insurance [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW_gPtuFN-o&t=82.24s)]
*  companies should help with if they possibly can. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW_gPtuFN-o&t=88.39999999999999s)]
*  But tonight Sarah Lewis came home from a funeral with a carful, a partner and a six year old. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW_gPtuFN-o&t=92.08s)]
*  She's been trying to get help from her insurer all day. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW_gPtuFN-o&t=98.63999999999999s)]
*  They've just come back and said they're going to put us in an Airbnb but only for one week. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW_gPtuFN-o&t=102.44s)]
*  But lots of our other neighbours haven't been able to get any accommodation. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW_gPtuFN-o&t=106.52s)]
*  Well it's now about 6.30 and frankly people are a bit confused by what's going on. Most [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW_gPtuFN-o&t=112.08s)]
*  of these people have somewhere to stay tonight but they were told there was going to be a [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW_gPtuFN-o&t=116.44s)]
*  public meeting to give them more information and so far it hasn't happened. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW_gPtuFN-o&t=119.8s)]
*  A councillor arrived and confirmed no meeting tonight, a misunderstanding. The district [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW_gPtuFN-o&t=124.32s)]
*  council has promised help for those turned down by their insurers and advice centre will [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW_gPtuFN-o&t=130.56s)]
*  open again tomorrow. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW_gPtuFN-o&t=136.4s)]
*  As for the hole, the reason it appeared hasn't been confirmed. It could take months to repair [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW_gPtuFN-o&t=138.56s)]
*  and reunite Godston's divided halves. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW_gPtuFN-o&t=144.12s)]
*  Tom Simons, BBC News, Surrey. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW_gPtuFN-o&t=147.16s)]
