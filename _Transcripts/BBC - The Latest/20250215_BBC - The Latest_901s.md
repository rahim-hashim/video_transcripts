Video Description: Hamas has released three Israeli hostages, after days of fears over future of the Gaza ceasefire.

The hostages are now back in Israel.

Israel is releasing 369 Palestinian prisoners in return - a few went to the West Bank, the majority are now arriving in Gaza.

Hamas said on Monday it would not release hostages this weekend, blaming Israel for alleged violations of the ceasefire. Israel had said if hostages weren't released by midday (local time) on Saturday, it would resume attacks on Gaza.

*  that have been holding them over the last 16 months, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=29.119999999999997s)]
*  Palestinian Islamic Jihad. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=31.599999999999998s)]

*  Sagi Dekelchen and Sasha Trufanov. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=36.96s)]
*  They were paraded before being handed over to the Red Cross. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=41.0s)]
*  The men, who had spent nearly 500 days in captivity, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=45.08s)]
*  will undergo medical examination and meet family members. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=48.8s)]
*  Now, these are live pictures from rain in southern Israel, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=53.44s)]
*  where you can see they're a helicopter waiting [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=57.16s)]
*  to bring those three hostages to Tel Aviv, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  where they are going to undergo quite a thorough investigation [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=63.239999999999995s)]
*  and quite a thorough medical examination, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=67.67999999999999s)]
*  both external medical examination, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=69.24s)]
*  but also psychological evaluation to try to determine [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=71.44s)]
*  whether they are in a stable state now [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=75.64s)]
*  to be able to readapt to their normal lives. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=78.56s)]
*  Sagi Dekelchen, one of the three men who has been released, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=81.32s)]
*  has now met his wife, who gave birth to their third child [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=86.72s)]
*  in December 2023, two months after he was captured. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=92.0s)]
*  And he has said, I am great. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=96.19999999999999s)]
*  He is meeting his third daughter for the first time. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=98.6s)]
*  You can see there one of the helicopters [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=100.88s)]
*  preparing to take off, a short trip to Tel Aviv, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=102.8s)]
*  where they will now have medical examinations. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=106.28s)]
*  Now, these are also live pictures [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=110.44s)]
*  that are coming to us from off a prison [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=112.72s)]
*  in the occupied West Bank, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=115.47999999999999s)]
*  where 369 Palestinians are due to be released. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=117.08s)]
*  Some of them already have been released, indeed, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=121.64s)]
*  as part of this ceasefire deal. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  These are Palestinian prisoners who were held, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  in some of them, for life sentences convicted [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=129.6s)]
*  of very serious crimes, murder and attempted murder [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=133.72s)]
*  and attacks on Israelis, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=137.88s)]
*  but the majority were arrested and held [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=139.84s)]
*  after the 7th of October. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=142.6s)]
*  The exchange was thrown into doubt earlier this week, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=145.48000000000002s)]
*  after Hamas said it would suspend the release, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=148.12s)]
*  accusing Israel of violating the truth, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=151.20000000000002s)]
*  something it denied. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=154.32000000000002s)]
*  But Egyptian and Qatari mediators [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=155.72s)]
*  helped to stop the ceasefire deal collapsing. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=158.20000000000002s)]
*  So you can see there, back in the skies above southern Israel, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=161.48000000000002s)]
*  that helicopter now in the air, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=164.92000000000002s)]
*  preparing to take the hostages to Tel Aviv, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=167.0s)]
*  where they will meet more of their families [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  and, as I say, they will have the medical checks [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=172.88s)]
*  and to spend a few more days in hospital. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, a lot of relief then about the three men [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=179.44s)]
*  who have been released today, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=182.12s)]
*  but there are still more than 70 hostages [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=183.2s)]
*  who are remaining in captivity in Gaza, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=185.44s)]
*  and a lot of trepidation, really, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=189.28s)]
*  from people here in hostage square over the fate of them. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  Among them is Nimrod Cohen, who is 20 years old. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=195.12s)]
*  He is a soldier in the Israeli Defense Forces, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=199.96s)]
*  and he was captured on the 7th of October. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=202.44000000000003s)]
*  A little earlier, I spoke to his mother, Vicky Cohen, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=205.12s)]
*  here on hostage square, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  and I asked her for her reaction to the releases today. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=209.36s)]
*  I'm very, very excited to see the picture [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=213.88000000000002s)]
*  of the three hostages that came back to the families [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=216.52s)]
*  after so long, but I'm very worried for my son, Nimrod, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=219.48000000000002s)]
*  who is still in captivity for almost 500 days. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=224.48000000000002s)]
*  He's not supposed to be released in the first phase, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=228.72s)]
*  only on the second, because he's a young man, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=232.72s)]
*  and I'm very worried for him. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=235.48000000000002s)]
*  I don't know what his situation, I know he's alive, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=237.72s)]
*  but I don't know if he's tortured, starved, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=241.20000000000002s)]
*  and I want him back home. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=245.28s)]
*  I want to hug him also, like the other families. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=247.92000000000002s)]
*  Can I ask, sorry, this is a difficult question, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=252.20000000000002s)]
*  but how do you know he's alive? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=254.60000000000002s)]
*  We got a sign of life from one of the hostages [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=257.23999999999995s)]
*  that came back this phase. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=260.59999999999997s)]
*  Who was with him together from December till May, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=264.23999999999995s)]
*  and he said he was okay, and we knew also from the video [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=270.55999999999995s)]
*  that Hamas released on that Saturday, the October 7th, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=276.55999999999995s)]
*  that Nimrod was taken alive. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=281.55999999999995s)]
*  He was not injured, but we don't know what his situation, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=283.08000000000004s)]
*  mentally and physically, today. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=288.16s)]
*  Just tell me about where he was taken from [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=291.04s)]
*  and what he was doing. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=293.36s)]
*  Nimrod is a soldier. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=295.12s)]
*  He was in his tank together with his team near the border [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=296.48s)]
*  when the Hamas terrorists came, entered Israel, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=300.52000000000004s)]
*  and he was only trying to defend the border, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=305.12s)]
*  ask the population, but he couldn't manage [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=310.28000000000003s)]
*  because there was a technical problem with the tank, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=314.16s)]
*  and the mess of terrorists came to them, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=317.32s)]
*  and they didn't have a chance. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=320.6s)]
*  Vicky, what has the last 16 months been like [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=323.36s)]
*  for you and your family? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=326.32s)]
*  Oh, it's a nightmare. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=327.64s)]
*  We don't live, we don't sleep. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=330.36s)]
*  There is unsentently about everything, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=334.4s)]
*  even about the deal, the first phase, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=336.88s)]
*  it can collapse every minute, it's very fragile, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=342.84s)]
*  and we are worried how long it will take, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=346.64s)]
*  how long I have to wait till I will see my son, Nimrod. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=349.23999999999995s)]
*  Vicky Cohen there, still waiting for news [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=359.71999999999997s)]
*  of her son, Nimrod, who she hopes will be released [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=362.12s)]
*  in phase two of the ceasefire deal, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=365.72s)]
*  if indeed we get to that point, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=367.68s)]
*  because as we were saying, there have been so many problems [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=369.52000000000004s)]
*  and so many doubts raised over the last week [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=373.76000000000005s)]
*  over the very fate of the ceasefire deal, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=377.20000000000005s)]
*  it seems to be hanging by a thread [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=379.04s)]
*  after Hamas threatened to suspend the release of hostages, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=381.16s)]
*  warning that Israel was, in its word, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=384.24s)]
*  violating the terms of the deal, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=386.24s)]
*  and Israel warned that if the releases did not happen today, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=388.36s)]
*  that the war in Gaza would resume. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=391.48s)]
*  It was left to regional mediators to try to bring it back on track, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=393.76000000000005s)]
*  Egyptians and Qataris managed to do so, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=397.92s)]
*  and for now it is holding, but there are big questions [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=401.24s)]
*  over whether the ceasefire deal can still survive [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=404.64000000000004s)]
*  and can be viable in the longer term. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=407.92s)]
*  Let's bring in Mohammed Hegazi, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=410.16s)]
*  who is a former Egyptian assistant foreign minister, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=411.8s)]
*  and therefore very much in one of the places [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=414.84000000000003s)]
*  that is central to the regional mediation [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=418.56s)]
*  in this ceasefire deal. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=421.16s)]
*  Mohammed Hegazi, thanks very much indeed for joining us here on BBC News. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=423.44s)]
*  How would you assess the chances of the negotiations progressing now [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=426.76s)]
*  in terms of moving towards a second phase of the ceasefire deal [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=431.91999999999996s)]
*  and whether this deal can actually last going forward? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=435.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, if the two parties adhere to their commitment, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=439.64s)]
*  then we have no problem. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=443.52s)]
*  It's almost two weeks now that the Israelis did not send their delegation [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=445.03999999999996s)]
*  to start negotiating the second phase. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=450.40000000000003s)]
*  So the delay of the release, and the second phase, by the way, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=454.32s)]
*  is the most important to the release of the largest number [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=458.36s)]
*  of the Israeli prisoners. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=463.24s)]
*  So this delay is unjustified. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=464.92s)]
*  The continuation of breaching the items and articles [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=468.32s)]
*  of the peace deal or the ceasefire [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=475.24s)]
*  brought us to a situation where the mediators have played [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=479.6s)]
*  over the past five days an extremely important dealing [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=485.2s)]
*  between the two parties, and successfully we saw the results today. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=491.16s)]
*  Palestinians are so happy. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=497.16s)]
*  So is the Israelis. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=499.28s)]
*  And I'm sure that if the Israeli government moves fast [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=501.12s)]
*  and open up a serious negotiation with the two negotiators, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=505.88s)]
*  then I can tell you that we trust that this very important deal will last. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=511.59999999999997s)]
*  And this is, I think, the chance, not through war, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=517.12s)]
*  not through resuming hostilities, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=520.6s)]
*  but it's to stick to a very important deal that we Americans and Qataris [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=524.1999999999999s)]
*  have spent with Israelis and Palestinians a great deal of efforts, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=529.8s)]
*  over 15 months of negotiation. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=534.56s)]
*  So time has come that everybody realized that this deal [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=538.0799999999999s)]
*  is the only peace deal on the table. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=542.68s)]
*  The alternative is destructive to the prisoners, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=545.68s)]
*  it's destructive to Gaza's future and to the stability in the Middle East. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=548.72s)]
*  I think the rationale here is that the two mediators are not enough. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=554.1999999999999s)]
*  The American administration also is engaged. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=560.36s)]
*  This negotiation was run by the previous administration [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=563.84s)]
*  and the present one. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=568.48s)]
*  Ambassador Witkoff is in the region, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=570.48s)]
*  and I'm sure that he plays a very constructive role [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=572.72s)]
*  to bring the parties together. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=576.24s)]
*  It's up to the Israelis now to answer to the family [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=577.72s)]
*  and bleed of the people gathering next to you. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=581.6800000000001s)]
*  Let me ask you, Mohammed Hegazi, sorry to interrupt [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=586.76s)]
*  because we are running against the clock as ever. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=589.16s)]
*  As we were talking to you, we're watching live pictures [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=591.16s)]
*  from the occupied West Bank of families waiting for the release [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=594.16s)]
*  of Palestinians from the Israeli jails there. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=598.16s)]
*  But you mentioned the role that the Americans are playing in all of this. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=602.16s)]
*  Donald Trump, of course, in the last week or so has muddied the waters [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=606.16s)]
*  to a large extent by talking about how the Americans would take over [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=610.16s)]
*  and resettle the Palestinians from the Gaza Strip. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=615.56s)]
*  What is your reaction to that and the impact that his comments are having [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=619.56s)]
*  on the viability and sustainability of the ceasefire deal? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=624.56s)]
*  Can I ask about whether the Egyptians are indeed coming up with an alternative? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=645.16s)]
*  Because Donald Trump and the White House trying to calm things slightly [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=669.16s)]
*  after those comments in the last few days have said, well, you know, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=674.16s)]
*  if others have a viable alternative, now is the time to come up with it. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=677.16s)]
*  So is Egypt going to propose an alternative for Gaza's rebuilding? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=681.16s)]
*  Palestinians and Bahrain being the president of the current session of the Arab League. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=703.16s)]
*  And then we will submit it again to full endorsement in the Arab Summit on the 27th of February. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=709.16s)]
*  After that, we will bring to the attention of all the parties and the United States [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=718.16s)]
*  to represent a roadmap to the well-being of the whole region, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=724.16s)]
*  not only to Israel and Palestinians, but a stability that we've been all looking for. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=730.16s)]
*  I think the Egyptian plan is a great hope that needs support from all parties. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=736.16s)]
*  Mohammed Hegazi, former Egyptian assistant foreign minister, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=740.16s)]
*  thank you very much indeed for your thoughts and insights here on BBC News. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=746.16s)]
*  Well, a reminder that as part of the ceasefire deal, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=750.16s)]
*  Gazans are replacing to what remains of their homes, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=753.16s)]
*  many of them now just in rubble in northern Gaza. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=756.16s)]
*  And also the ceasefire deal should be seeing a surge of aid getting into Gaza. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=760.16s)]
*  And while quite a lot of supplies and vital humanitarian aid has been getting in, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=765.16s)]
*  one of the disputes between Hamas and Israel has been over the provision of mobile homes [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=770.16s)]
*  and caravans that are stacked up at the Egyptian border with Gaza. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=776.16s)]
*  And in Gaza, they desperately need those to go into the territory [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=780.16s)]
*  and they need shelter for displaced Gazans. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=784.16s)]
*  But Hamas has accused Israel of holding them up. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=787.16s)]
*  We wait to see whether or not they will get into the territory. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=790.16s)]
*  But of course, the humanitarian situation on the ground remains very, very, very bad [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=793.16s)]
*  after 16 months of this war. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=798.16s)]
*  Steve Cutts is CEO of Medical Aid for Palestinians, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=801.16s)]
*  and he outlined some of the vital needs that there are on the ground in Gaza. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=804.16s)]
*  Some aid is getting in, and I think that has to be welcomed. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=809.16s)]
*  And of course, we're incredibly pleased that the ceasefire plan is now back on course. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=812.16s)]
*  The temporary ceasefire does need to become a permanent ceasefire. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=817.16s)]
*  But so much is needed. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=821.16s)]
*  I mean, this isn't the end of the risk to the Palestinians in Gaza. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=822.16s)]
*  They are suffering from lack of medical treatment, they need shelters, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=827.16s)]
*  and shelters haven't been getting through to the extent needed. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=831.16s)]
*  There are food shortages and obviously clean, drinkable water. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=834.16s)]
*  There's a massive challenge ahead, and we would call the opening up of all routes into Gaza [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=838.16s)]
*  and the absolutely unfettered access of humanitarian assistance at this stage. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=843.16s)]
*  Steve Cutts there from Medical Aid for Palestinians. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=850.16s)]
*  So the three released Israeli hostages are on their way back here to Tel Aviv, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=853.16s)]
*  where they will be reunited with more families, more family members, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=858.16s)]
*  and then stay several days, we expect, in hospital. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=862.16s)]
*  And as we saw there from those pictures outside, off a prison in the West Bank, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=866.16s)]
*  more detainees are due to be released there as well, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=870.16s)]
*  also to be reunited with their families and with their loved ones. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=873.16s)]
*  You can see here a quick reminder of that release of the three men [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=878.16s)]
*  who were let out this morning after almost 500 days in captivity, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=883.16s)]
*  Sagi Dekelchen, Sasha Trutfanov and Yair Horn. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=889.16s)]
*  Now on their way back to be reunited with their families [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=893.16s)]
*  and to try to rebuild what remains of their shattered lives. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLPHcaUwt8E&t=897.16s)]
