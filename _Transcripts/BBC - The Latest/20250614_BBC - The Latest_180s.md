Video Description: A Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband were shot and killed in their home early on Saturday morning in what Governor Tim Walz called a "act of targeted political violence".
 
Walz said House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman, a Democrat, and her husband were killed.
 
State Senator John Hoffman, also a Democrat, and his wife were targeted in their home as well.
 
They were shot multiple times and are out of surgery, Walz said at a news conference.
 
Walz said the targeted shootings occurred in Brooklyn Park and Champlin, neighbouring cities to Minneapolis. A manhunt is underway for a suspect.

*  Now police are searching for the suspect who escaped after a shootout with officers. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYq9TueXRcw&t=24.96s)]
*  Minnesota Governor Tim Waltz said it was an act of political violence. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYq9TueXRcw&t=29.36s)]
*  We're here today because an unspeakable tragedy has unfolded in Minnesota. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYq9TueXRcw&t=35.2s)]
*  My good friend and colleague, Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYq9TueXRcw&t=39.36s)]
*  were shot and killed early this morning in what appears to be a politically motivated assassination. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYq9TueXRcw&t=43.44s)]
*  Our state lost a great leader and I lost a dearest of friends. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYq9TueXRcw&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  Speaker Hortman was someone who served the people of Minnesota with grace, compassion, humor. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYq9TueXRcw&t=53.92s)]
*  And a sense of service. She was a formidable public servant, a fixture and a giant in Minnesota. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYq9TueXRcw&t=59.36s)]
*  She woke up every day determined to make this state a better place. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYq9TueXRcw&t=67.92s)]
*  She is irreplaceable and we've been missed by so many. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYq9TueXRcw&t=73.2s)]
*  Minnesota's thoughts and prayers are with her family, her loved ones, her children and her parents. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYq9TueXRcw&t=77.92s)]
*  My prayers also go out to State Senator John Hoffman and his wife of that, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYq9TueXRcw&t=83.44s)]
*  who were each shot multiple times. The Hoffmans are out of surgery at this time and receiving care [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYq9TueXRcw&t=88.96s)]
*  and we are cautiously optimistic they will survive this assassination attempt. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYq9TueXRcw&t=94.88s)]
*  This was an act of targeted political violence. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYq9TueXRcw&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  Peaceful discourse is the foundation of our democracy. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYq9TueXRcw&t=105.6s)]
*  We don't settle our differences with violence or at gunpoint. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYq9TueXRcw&t=111.19999999999999s)]
*  In the state of Minnesota, and as recently as last week, in the most closely divided state legislature in the country, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYq9TueXRcw&t=114.72s)]
*  we sat down, we worked things out, we debated, we shook hands and compromised, and we served the state of Minnesota together. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYq9TueXRcw&t=121.76s)]
*  We proved that it's possible, even in these politically charged times, to find compromise [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYq9TueXRcw&t=131.76s)]
*  and adhere to the principles of democracy and civil discourse. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYq9TueXRcw&t=137.76s)]
*  We must all, Minnesota and across the country, stand against all forms of political violence. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYq9TueXRcw&t=141.76s)]
*  So Minnesota Governor Tim Waltz with that breaking news that a U.S. politician, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYq9TueXRcw&t=148.88s)]
*  State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband have been killed and in a separate shooting, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYq9TueXRcw&t=154.88s)]
*  Senator John Hoffman and his wife are recovering after surgery. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYq9TueXRcw&t=162.07999999999998s)]
