Video Description: A deal removing some trade barriers between the UK and US has been signed off by US President Donald Trump with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer at the G7 summit in Canada.
 
The move will bring into force parts of an agreement agreed between the two countries last month, and reduce tariffs on UK cars being shipped to the US.
 
The deal includes a 10% levy on most UK goods, including cars, and did not address the expected removal of charges on steel imports.

# Donald Trump signs order confirming parts of US-UK tariff deal | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ)
*  A deal has been signed off at the G7 between the US and the UK. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's over to Sally for the details. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=2.7600000000000002s)]
*  Sally. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=3.88s)]
*  Thanks very much, Lauren. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=4.44s)]
*  Yeah, let's tell you what's been going on, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=5.44s)]
*  because the US and the UK, as we've just mentioned, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=7.72s)]
*  has signed a tariff deal, which will [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=11.96s)]
*  see lower charges for certain products for both countries. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=13.88s)]
*  Speaking at the G7 summit in Alberta, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=17.48s)]
*  Prime Minister Sir Kirstama called the move [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=20.52s)]
*  a very important day for both sides. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=22.76s)]
*  It comes after weeks of talks to implement [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=25.88s)]
*  parts of the pact, which the UK government hopes [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=28.6s)]
*  will shield British businesses from the impact of Donald [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=31.360000000000003s)]
*  Trump's tariffs. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=35.28s)]
*  So the signed deal includes a 10% levy on most UK goods. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=36.88s)]
*  However, it did not address the expected removal [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=41.84s)]
*  of charges on UK steel exports to the US. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=44.64s)]
*  That's still being discussed. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=48.040000000000006s)]
*  In the order that Trump signed on Monday, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  the US said it would allow up to 100,000 cars into the US [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=52.72s)]
*  at the 10% tariff. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  And this is a big drop from the 27.5% American tax [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=60.08s)]
*  imposed on all imports of cars earlier this year. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=64.32s)]
*  Both leaders seem pleased with the agreement. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=68.52s)]
*  But you see, the level of enthusiasm is very good. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=71.67999999999999s)]
*  But the relationship that we have is fantastic. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  So I just want to congratulate you. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=77.6s)]
*  Donald, thank you very much. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=80.24s)]
*  This now implements on car tariffs and aerospace [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=82.56s)]
*  a really important agreement. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=87.0s)]
*  And so this is a very good day for both of our countries, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=88.44s)]
*  a real sign of strength. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=91.19999999999999s)]
*  So thank you again, Donald. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=92.44s)]
*  A really important day for both of us. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  Great people, great people. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=96.47999999999999s)]
*  Great deal, great people, important moment. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=99.63999999999999s)]
*  They're both bigging this up. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=102.19999999999999s)]
*  But what do others think of this deal? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=104.6s)]
*  Well, I talked to Kyle Handley, who's a professor of economics [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=106.19999999999999s)]
*  at the University of California, San Diego, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=109.19999999999999s)]
*  and he's not so convinced. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=111.72s)]
*  I'm not as excited about the deal as they are. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=114.28s)]
*  Tell me why. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=117.0s)]
*  So this is not much of a deal, I think, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=118.75999999999999s)]
*  from either the US or the United Kingdom perspective. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=121.96s)]
*  Donald Trump raised tariffs quite a bit on UK imports [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=124.96s)]
*  and then got the UK to reduce some barriers [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=129.16s)]
*  on some of its own products. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=132.68s)]
*  But most of those higher tariffs are still in place. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=134.0s)]
*  And now we are basically rationing [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=137.0s)]
*  how many cars can be exported and imported [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=140.72s)]
*  from the UK. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=144.44s)]
*  And I don't think that's going to work out very well [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=145.36s)]
*  for either side. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=150.08s)]
*  I mean, it's just gonna mean cars are more expensive [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=150.92000000000002s)]
*  and we're telling people how much they're allowed to sell. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=153.12s)]
*  Well, when I looked at the data for last year, for example, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=155.44s)]
*  to see how many cars Jaguar Land Rover sold to the US, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=159.44s)]
*  it was 100,000. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=162.6s)]
*  And actually the School of Motor Manufacturers and Traders [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=164.44s)]
*  says that for the UK as a whole, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=168.0s)]
*  it was just over 100,000 cars sold into the US [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=170.23999999999998s)]
*  from the UK in 2024. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=174.79999999999998s)]
*  So it would seem the cap is sitting [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=177.16s)]
*  at kind of the right level, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=179.76s)]
*  but it doesn't give room for expansion, does it really, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=181.56s)]
*  in terms of the lower tariffs? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=185.16s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think that's what worries me about it [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=187.72s)]
*  is they've set this number now based on last year's data. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=189.88s)]
*  And it's the government on both sides [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=194.32s)]
*  are essentially choosing the quantity. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=196.51999999999998s)]
*  And then they're gonna have to decide [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=198.72s)]
*  how do we allocate that quota to all of our UK manufacturers [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=200.12s)]
*  and who gets to export under the quota and who doesn't. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  And they may worry that they're gonna hit that limit [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=207.56s)]
*  some years and some years they won't. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=209.56s)]
*  And that means that it's gonna be difficult to know [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=211.68s)]
*  what your tariff liability really is. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=214.48000000000002s)]
*  So it creates, I think a more complex, less simple system. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=216.52s)]
*  But if you're looking to buy a Mini or a Bentley [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=221.36s)]
*  or a Jaguar car in the US, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=224.32s)]
*  a 10% hit is a lot better than nearly 30%, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=227.07999999999998s)]
*  which is where we could have been. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=230.92s)]
*  And also it's not just cars, it's the aerospace sector, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=232.88s)]
*  it's other sectors that will really benefit from this. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=236.04s)]
*  True, I agree with you on that. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=239.12s)]
*  I mean, the tariffs are gonna be lower [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=240.68s)]
*  than they otherwise would have been. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=243.44s)]
*  But if none of this had been started in the first place [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=245.79999999999998s)]
*  back in April by the Trump administration, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=248.35999999999999s)]
*  we'd all be paying much lower tariffs. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=251.6s)]
*  The devil is certainly in the detail. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=255.16s)]
*  What do people think on this side of the pond? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=257.28s)]
*  Will Walker-Arnott is director of private clients [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=259.32s)]
*  at Charles Stanley. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=262.16s)]
*  He gave me his reaction to the deal. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=263.28s)]
*  We're in a better position than we were post-liberation, David. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=266.04s)]
*  Actually, from the start of the year, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=270.12s)]
*  I think the UK economy is probably gonna suffer [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=272.0s)]
*  from these changes. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=274.36s)]
*  But you're quite right. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=275.28s)]
*  I think the automotive sector will be pleased. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=276.88s)]
*  They were putting pressure on Keir Starmer [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=279.12s)]
*  to get a deal across the line [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=280.92s)]
*  since this deal was first announced in May. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=282.40000000000003s)]
*  And it is gonna be of benefit to them. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=285.68s)]
*  Effectively, it is a cars for agriculture deal. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=288.32s)]
*  And we export, I think, about nine billion pounds worth [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=292.44s)]
*  of cars to the US each year. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=295.92s)]
*  And so they will be pleased with this reduction in tariffs. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=297.92s)]
*  And also, Will, we need to take into account, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=300.56s)]
*  I mean, at the G7, a lot of global leaders gathered, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=302.76s)]
*  all of whom want to cut a deal with President Trump. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=306.84000000000003s)]
*  Ursula von der Leyen had one-on-one conversations, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=310.08000000000004s)]
*  and she said they've made progress for the EU. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=313.28000000000003s)]
*  As Mark Carney did, he was first in line as host of G7 [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=316.52000000000004s)]
*  with a commitment from President Trump [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=320.6s)]
*  to agree something for Canada within 30 days. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=324.84000000000003s)]
*  Whereas for Saqiyah Starmer, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=327.8s)]
*  it was signed and sealed then and there. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=329.6s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it is a coup for the UK government. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=333.32000000000005s)]
*  We are first out the traps. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=336.12s)]
*  We're the first one to have a deal. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=337.52000000000004s)]
*  So that is great. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=339.04s)]
*  And it's great for the automotive sector [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=340.2s)]
*  and also the aerospace sector. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=342.52s)]
*  What was not included in the deal [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=344.2s)]
*  is worth also pointing out. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=345.96s)]
*  I think you alluded to earlier, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=347.52s)]
*  they haven't managed to reach an agreement on steel yet [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=349.24s)]
*  because there are some supply chain technicalities there. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=352.16s)]
*  We also haven't got any more detail on a deal [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=356.32s)]
*  in terms of the drug industry and the pharmaceutical industry. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=359.84s)]
*  So we're waiting to hear a little bit more there. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=364.12s)]
*  But you're quite right. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIkX8EnFlQ&t=366.48s)]
