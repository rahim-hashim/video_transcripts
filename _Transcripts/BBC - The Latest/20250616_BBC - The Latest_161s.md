Video Description: A man has been arrested on suspicion of killing a Democratic state lawmaker and her husband, after a two-day manhunt in the US state of Minnesota.
 
The chase came to an end in a wooded rural area west of Minneapolis, where he surrendered peacefully and ended up crawling towards officers, police said.
 
Vance Luther Boelter, 57, is charged with killing Melissa Hortman, a Minnesota Democrat, and her husband Mark. 
 
He is also alleged to have shot and wounded Democratic State Senator John Hoffman, and his wife Yvette, who are both now awake in hospital.
 
In a statement, President Donald Trump said "such horrific violence will not be tolerated in the United States of America," and authorities would be "prosecuting anyone involved to the fullest extent of the law".
