Video Description: A plane carrying the former president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, has left Manila after the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued a warrant accusing him of crimes against humanity over his deadly "war on drugs".
 
He was taken into police custody shortly after his arrival at the capital's international airport from Hong Kong.
 
Duterte, 79, contested his detention but within hours was on a chartered jet en route to The Hague in the Netherlands, where the ICC sits.
 
During Duterte's time in office, thousands of small-time drug dealers, users and others were killed without trial.

*  Hague in the Netherlands where the ICC sits. Let's go to The Hague now and speak to our [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUBnXJTDBU&t=32.0s)]
*  correspondent Anna Hulligan. Anna, it often takes years to get people who have have arrest [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUBnXJTDBU&t=37.0s)]
*  warrants issued against them on their way to The Hague. How is it different this time? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUBnXJTDBU&t=44.0s)]
*  It's remarkable. In international justice terms, this is moving at warp speed. The arrest [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUBnXJTDBU&t=51.0s)]
*  warrant was issued in secret under seal on 7 March. By 11, it became public. Shortly [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUBnXJTDBU&t=57.12s)]
*  after he had been at a protest in Hong Kong, arrived back in Manila, he was taken into [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUBnXJTDBU&t=64.84s)]
*  custody, we understand, by Interpol. During that time, he was on his daughter's Instagram [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUBnXJTDBU&t=70.48s)]
*  live feed asking to be tried in the Philippines. Shortly after that, he was put on a plane [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUBnXJTDBU&t=76.56s)]
*  from Manila to Dubai. He has been stopped over there. We have seen some images which [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUBnXJTDBU&t=81.44s)]
*  appear to show him having lunch. In the last hour, his plane departed from Dubai en route [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUBnXJTDBU&t=85.96000000000001s)]
*  to Rotterdam. We have seen a handful of protesters, supporters here at the ICC in The Hague. They [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUBnXJTDBU&t=93.0s)]
*  have just been told they need to go away and get a permit to protest. In fact, we expect [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUBnXJTDBU&t=99.64s)]
*  when he arrives here in The Hague, Rodrigo Duterte will become the first former Asian [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUBnXJTDBU&t=105.92s)]
*  leader to be indicted by the ICC. He will be taken to the ICC's detention centre, which [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUBnXJTDBU&t=112.4s)]
*  is not far from where I am. There he will be checked in, checked over by a doctor. Only [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUBnXJTDBU&t=118.92s)]
*  at that point, I think the ICC will probably confirm that he is indeed in the ICC's custody. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUBnXJTDBU&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  This is a historic day in terms of international justice. Just talk us through the charges [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUBnXJTDBU&t=131.16s)]
*  he is facing, Anna. Yes. In the last hour or so, I have been speaking to his supporters [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUBnXJTDBU&t=137.56s)]
*  here who say he was a great president, he was a good man and maybe there are questions [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUBnXJTDBU&t=146.68s)]
*  to be answered. In fact, according to the ICC arrest warrant, Rodrigo Duterte was responsible [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUBnXJTDBU&t=150.72s)]
*  for widespread systematic attacks on civilians, predominantly targeting drug users and drug [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUBnXJTDBU&t=156.64s)]
*  dealers in a covert clean-up campaign by his so-called death squad. So this was, according [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUBnXJTDBU&t=163.92s)]
*  to the ICC, state-sponsored campaign of murder. And those are the charges he will have to [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUBnXJTDBU&t=170.27999999999997s)]
*  answer here at The Hague. We expect Rodrigo Duterte to make his first appearance here [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUBnXJTDBU&t=176.04s)]
*  at the ICC in The Hague next week. Anna, thank you very much. Anna Hologun with the latest [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUBnXJTDBU&t=182.0s)]
*  on the proceedings at the International Criminal Court. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMUBnXJTDBU&t=187.16s)]
