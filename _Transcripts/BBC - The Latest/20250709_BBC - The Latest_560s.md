Video Description: Up to 20 people, including at least six children, have been killed in two Israeli airstrikes overnight in Gaza, Gaza's Hamas-run civil defence agency has said.
 
Ten members of the same family were killed during the first airstrike, as they were sheltering in the Al-Mawasi area of Khan Younis. A second airstrike on the Al-Shati camp near Gaza City, also left more than 30 wounded, the civil defence agencyâ€™s spokesperson said.
 
It comes as US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met for the second time to discuss the ongoing war in Gaza.
 
Before discussions resumed on Tuesday, a Palestinian source familiar with the talks told the BBC they have not made any headway.

# Children among 20 people reported killed overnight by Israeli strikes on Gaza | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc)
*  The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says freeing the hostages that remain in Gaza [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=0.0s)]
*  was the focus of his latest talks with President Trump at the White House. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=5.44s)]
*  The unscheduled meeting was the second time the two men have met [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=9.6s)]
*  in as many days to discuss efforts to agree on a six-day ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=13.52s)]
*  Earlier, Mr Trump's special envoy, Steve Witzkopf, said he was hopeful a six-day [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=19.04s)]
*  truce could be agreed by the end of this week. Meanwhile, a Palestinian official has told the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  BBC that the current round of ongoing indirect talks between Israel and Hamas in Qatar are [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=29.68s)]
*  stalling with a key sticking point being how aid should be delivered during any ceasefire. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=35.6s)]
*  In Gaza itself, the civil defence agency says that 20 people have been killed in overnight [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=41.28s)]
*  Israeli strikes, including at least six children. These pictures are from the Al-Shatzi camp in [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  northern Gaza. Reports say 10 people were killed there. Well, here's more of what Mr Netanyahu [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  posted on social media after his latest talks with President Trump. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=59.2s)]
*  Our Middle East editor Sebastian Asha is in Jerusalem and explains how close we might be [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=83.68s)]
*  to a potential ceasefire. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=89.2s)]
*  We knew there would be sticking points, we knew that it would be difficult. There seemed to be [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=119.2s)]
*  some technical details over the specifics of this particular ceasefire proposal as it's been laid [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=123.60000000000001s)]
*  out. What we're hearing from the Hamas side is they don't really feel that the Israeli negotiating [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=128.88s)]
*  team has been given the authority to answer their questions, so they don't feel that anything is [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=134.56s)]
*  moving there at the moment. From the Israeli side, we've heard some sense that things are [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=139.6s)]
*  moving forward, but there's also in the Israeli media some reports suggesting [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=145.28s)]
*  also that things could take some time. The Qataris, the main mediators here, the ones who [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=149.36s)]
*  are hosting the talks, have also said they believe that progress can be made, but it's likely [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=154.0s)]
*  to take days. And meanwhile, continued reports of killings in Gaza. What can you tell us about this, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=158.32s)]
*  Sebastian? Well, these reports we've had from the civil defence agency, the rescue workers in Gaza, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=164.4s)]
*  saying that at least 20 people have been killed in overnight Israeli strikes in two places in [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=173.28s)]
*  particular. And I mean, this is what we're seeing pretty much every day, even as these talks go on, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=179.28s)]
*  even as Mr Netanyahu and President Trump are holding these meetings, these two meetings they've [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=184.32s)]
*  now had in Washington. The daily life in Gaza that people there have got used to, which is that they [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=188.96s)]
*  are struggling to find food and they're still facing Israeli attacks, continues. All of that, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=196.56s)]
*  you would think, would give a boost, added momentum, added urgency to the talks, to the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=202.08s)]
*  sense of trying to get a ceasefire nailed down. And people in Gaza have voiced to us over the past [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=207.60000000000002s)]
*  few days their concern that this all may be a mirage and that nothing will really come of it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=212.8s)]
*  That was the BBC's Sebastian Asher in Jerusalem. Let's bring in Amy Shalan, director at Makan [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=219.28s)]
*  and chair of the British-Palestinian committee. Thank you for joining us on BBC News. We've been [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=225.84s)]
*  here so many times in the last few months on the brink of what appears to be a fresh [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=231.6s)]
*  ceasefire. What's your expectation this time around? Well, obviously everyone is hopeful that a ceasefire [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=237.2s)]
*  will come. Over the past 21 months, we've witnessed with ever increasing horror Israel's [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=244.48s)]
*  military violence against Palestinians in Gaza. And it's been live streamed in real time as [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=252.07999999999998s)]
*  Israel's committed worsening atrocities and unthinkably with the British government's [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=258.4s)]
*  continuing diplomatic and military support. And it's just worth reminding your viewers that Israel [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=263.52s)]
*  has attacked every single hospital in Gaza. Most are inaccessible or abandoned. And in areas under [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=271.2s)]
*  evacuation order, Israel has turned them into kill zones. And the few that have survived the [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=279.52s)]
*  bombardment of the health system are absolutely overwhelmed by the influx of injuries now. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=286.0s)]
*  They're still under attack. They're unable to keep up with the influx of injuries and also the [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=293.04s)]
*  spread of disease. We've seen starvation as a weapon of war. And now we're seeing also militarized [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=299.52s)]
*  aid and the dismantling or attempts to dismantle those systems that have historically been able to [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=306.48s)]
*  provide aid to the Palestinian people. So the baseline of this ceasefire also is not even to [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=315.92s)]
*  end the siege of Gaza or to stop the occupation. It's not even about reconstructing Gaza. And yet [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=323.76s)]
*  they're finding it so difficult to negotiate. It's not even about people returning to their homes. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=330.56s)]
*  It's now as low as stopping the execution of people who are seeking food. And it's really [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=336.88s)]
*  quite impossible to convey the magnitude and severity of what's happening in Gaza [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=343.92s)]
*  and the helplessness that people feel as a result in the face of not only Israel's actions, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=352.16s)]
*  but the complicity of governments like the UK that have been active partners with what's happening [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=359.2s)]
*  on the ground. Of course, the focus at the moment we understand from a Palestinian official is [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=366.0s)]
*  how aid will be distributed in Gaza. Israel says that its aid system it's set up is getting more [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=372.0s)]
*  foods to Gazans and the fact that people are being killed around some of these distribution sites, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=377.84000000000003s)]
*  it says it's been targeting suspects. But just tell us what is the situation when it comes to [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=383.36s)]
*  aid in the wider Gaza territory at the moment? Well, it's just very difficult. We've seen [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=388.56s)]
*  the pictures of people desperately trying to get to aid stations. There used to be widespread [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=395.91999999999996s)]
*  access to aid across Gaza. Now it's being confined to small spaces where people have to risk their [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=404.15999999999997s)]
*  lives in order to obtain food. The evidence is there and that has to be brought to a stop [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=410.47999999999996s)]
*  immediately. It's being used as a way to continue the starvation of Palestinian people [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=419.76s)]
*  and to fire on them and to threaten them and make them fearful of actually trying to get some support. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=428.71999999999997s)]
*  When you speak to Gazans, what are their expectations of what could bring about [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=437.44s)]
*  a fresh ceasefire and hopefully an end to this war? Well, they're just desperate for an end to [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=444.0s)]
*  the horrific killing that is going on but also they feel abandoned by the international community, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=452.40000000000003s)]
*  which has allowed for famine and mass displacement to engulf the territory. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=461.04s)]
*  And please remember, 90%, over 90% of Gaza's population has been forcibly displaced, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=467.76s)]
*  many of them multiple times, confined into ever-shrinking spaces. We now have bakeries [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=474.15999999999997s)]
*  and water systems inoperable and most of the arable land has been destroyed. And this devastation [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=480.64s)]
*  isn't collateral. It is part of a systematic campaign to dismantle and destroy the foundations [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=487.68s)]
*  of Palestinian life in Gaza. The targeted destruction of homes, schools, universities, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=494.96s)]
*  cultural institutions, places of worship and medical infrastructure, the deliberate targeting [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=501.84s)]
*  of doctors, of journalists, of academics and the obstruction of humanitarian aid and the creation [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=508.24s)]
*  of mass starvation and famine, this all demonstrates a strategic aim to eliminate [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=515.12s)]
*  Palestinian collective life. So what Palestinians want, what we need is real action in support of [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=521.28s)]
*  accountability and to ensure that all Palestinians can live in freedom, dignity and justice. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=528.0799999999999s)]
*  And of course, Amy, it's important to say that, of course, Israel's position is that it does not [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=536.0s)]
*  target individuals, doctors, professionals and others. And of course, the UK government has said [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=542.0799999999999s)]
*  that it is speaking out against the killing of civilians in Gaza as well. But Amy Shalan, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=549.12s)]
*  director of Makan, thank you so much for joining us on BBC News. We appreciate it. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htiQSD3jRHc&t=555.92s)]
