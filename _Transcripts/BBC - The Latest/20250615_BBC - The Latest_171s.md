**BBC - The Latest:** [June 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9kg2rhVgto)
*  Police in Minnesota say they've arrested and charged the man they suspect of being behind the shooting dead of a Democratic Party politician and her husband. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9kg2rhVgto&t=0.0s)]
*  Melissa and Mark Hortman were killed on Saturday at their home just north of Minneapolis. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9kg2rhVgto&t=9.0s)]
*  There's been a huge manhunt underway since then. Police gave an update a short time ago. Our reporter in Minnesota, Mike Wendling, was watching. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9kg2rhVgto&t=15.0s)]
*  We just got an update from police. They are giving details of how the suspect was apprehended after nearly 48 hours. It's just about to turn over into Monday here locally. We're hearing that he was armed, but he gave up without a fight and there was nobody injured. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9kg2rhVgto&t=25.0s)]
*  No police officers were injured in apprehending him. Earlier today, there was a lot of activity in a rural area about 50 miles, about 80 kilometers away from the city of Minneapolis. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9kg2rhVgto&t=41.0s)]
*  And it's near the home of the suspect, Vance Belter, and he was found nearby and he was taken into custody. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9kg2rhVgto&t=55.0s)]
*  And we must mention, of course, there was the tragic killing of Melissa and Mark Hortman. There was also survivors of these deadly attacks too who've been speaking to the media. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9kg2rhVgto&t=63.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. Other Democratic lawmakers were in an attack in a separate town. There was a list of 50 to 70 we're hearing other lawmakers from the Democratic Party who were on this list. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9kg2rhVgto&t=73.0s)]
*  Fortunately, they appeared to be in stable condition in hospital and all indications are that they will survive their injuries. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9kg2rhVgto&t=90.0s)]
*  But sadly and tragically, Melissa Hortman and her husband are dead. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9kg2rhVgto&t=102.0s)]
*  Yeah, that is State Senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, who were injured as well. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9kg2rhVgto&t=107.0s)]
*  And just to say, Mike, this has raised huge questions, hasn't it, about security surrounding politicians in the U.S.? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9kg2rhVgto&t=115.0s)]
*  Absolutely. We're also hearing from police that the suspect had a list not only of politicians here in Minnesota, but surrounding states throughout the Midwest. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9kg2rhVgto&t=121.0s)]
*  Obviously, this is not the first time that political violence has visited the U.S. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9kg2rhVgto&t=133.0s)]
*  We had two assassination attempts against President Trump last year. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9kg2rhVgto&t=138.0s)]
*  There has been other political violence. The governor of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro, had his house firebombed. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9kg2rhVgto&t=143.0s)]
*  In a political culture here in Minnesota that prides itself on being very collegial, very willing to cross party lines and very friendly, it's a shock. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9kg2rhVgto&t=150.0s)]
*  And people here are very astonished at the developments of the last two days. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9kg2rhVgto&t=161.0s)]
*  The BBC's Mike Wendling there. Now, funerals have been taking place. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9kg2rhVgto&t=167.0s)]
