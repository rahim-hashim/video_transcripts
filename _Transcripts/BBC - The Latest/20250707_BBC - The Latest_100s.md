**BBC - The Latest:** [July 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxYdIrDxJ4E)
*  At least 81 people are now known to have died in catastrophic flash floods that swept through parts of central Texas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxYdIrDxJ4E&t=0.0s)]
*  Dozens of people are still missing, including 10 girls who are attending a summer camp near the Guadalupe River in Kerr County. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxYdIrDxJ4E&t=8.0s)]
*  We're joined now by CBS News correspondent Jason Allen, who's in Kerrville, Texas. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxYdIrDxJ4E&t=15.0s)]
*  Jason, a lot of children have lost their lives and the death toll keeps rising. What is the latest there? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxYdIrDxJ4E&t=20.0s)]
*  It does keep rising. You mentioned that there are 81 people missing. There are 10 or 81 people confirmed dead. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxYdIrDxJ4E&t=28.0s)]
*  There are still 10 of those children missing and there are still a number of adults and other family members who are missing as well. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxYdIrDxJ4E&t=33.0s)]
*  Besides those children's campgrounds, which are scattered up and down both sides of the Guadalupe River here in Texas, there are many, many private campgrounds. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxYdIrDxJ4E&t=41.0s)]
*  This happened on the Fourth of July holiday. Many of those campgrounds, one of which we are in this morning, were full of people in RVs [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxYdIrDxJ4E&t=50.0s)]
*  staying in small cabins, some of them in tents. It's unknown right now how many of them evacuated safely and how many of them may have been caught up in the flood. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxYdIrDxJ4E&t=57.0s)]
*  First responders here, and this is a mix of both local and state and national resources, have completed their primary search of the river and maybe 100 yards, 100 meters on each side of the river. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxYdIrDxJ4E&t=67.0s)]
*  But those searches continue. Teams are going out in boats. They are looking in piles of debris. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxYdIrDxJ4E&t=79.0s)]
*  There have also been teams scouring the banks on foot in case there may be anybody left alive and also, of course, to try to discover the victims, others who may have been killed in this flash flood. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxYdIrDxJ4E&t=85.0s)]
*  Jason, thank you. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxYdIrDxJ4E&t=98.0s)]
