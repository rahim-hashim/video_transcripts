Video Description: The UK and US have not signed an international agreement on artificial intelligence (AI) at a global summit in Paris.
 
The statement, signed by France, China and India among other countries, pledges an "open", "inclusive" and "ethical" approach to the technology's development.
 
Downing Street said the UK "hadn't been able to agree all parts of the leaders' declaration" and would "only ever sign up to initiatives that are in UK national interests".
 
The statement signed by 60 countries says the summit has affirmed to reducing digital divides by promoting AI accessibility, and ensuring it is "transparent" and "safe", among other aims.

# UK and US refuse to sign international AI declaration | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw)
*  Now, dozens of nations have called for open and ethical artificial intelligence at the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=0.0s)]
*  AI summit in Paris. World leaders, top tech executives and policymakers gathered there [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=4.76s)]
*  to debate AI's impact on the whole future of world security, business, jobs and much [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=10.08s)]
*  more. The summit has been co-hosted by India, which has been announced as the next location [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=16.0s)]
*  and host for the next AI summit. But this time around, today, the US and the UK have [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=20.78s)]
*  failed to sign that final declaration on sustainable and inclusive AI. Well, India's Prime Minister [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=26.44s)]
*  Narendra Modi told the conference that AI is developing at an unprecedented scale and [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=32.28s)]
*  speed and called for global efforts to introduce governance rules. He also spoke of the potential [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=36.64s)]
*  for AI to create jobs. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  We are at the dawn of the AI age that will shape the course of humanity. Some people [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=44.76s)]
*  worry about machines becoming superior in intelligence to humans. But no one holds the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=55.08s)]
*  key to our collective future and shared destiny other than us humans. That sense of responsibility [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=67.64s)]
*  must guide us. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=85.24000000000001s)]
*  Narendra Modi, the Indian Prime Minister there, will the US Vice President JD Vance called [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=88.24000000000001s)]
*  on European countries to be optimistic about AI technology. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=93.28s)]
*  The Trump administration will ensure that the most powerful AI systems are built in [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=98.64s)]
*  the US with American designed and manufactured chips. Now, just because we're the leader [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=103.28s)]
*  doesn't mean we want to or need to go it alone, of course. And let me be emphatic about this [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=109.52000000000001s)]
*  point. America wants to partner with all of you. We want to embark on the AI revolution [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  before us with the spirit of openness and collaboration. But to create that kind of [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=122.28s)]
*  trust, we need international regulatory regimes that fosters the creation of AI technology [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=129.76s)]
*  rather than strangles it. And we need our European friends in particular to look to [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=137.28s)]
*  this new frontier with optimism rather than trepidation. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=142.24s)]
*  Well, although the summit is taking place as India has been co-hosting that event alongside [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=145.8s)]
*  the French. So I'm joined now by the co-founder of the AI for India program, Shashi Shekhar [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=151.56s)]
*  Vempati. Thank you very much for being with us. When you look at what the final declaration [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=157.48s)]
*  has said and what they might have achieved this week, what has changed as a result of [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=162.72s)]
*  this summit, do you think? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=167.84s)]
*  I think it's clearly brought, you know, center stage focus on, you know, not just looking [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=169.88s)]
*  at the risks and the safety angle of AI, but also to look at the opportunities. And I think [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=176.32s)]
*  that's where Prime Minister Modi and India kind of stand at the crossroads of these two [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=181.36s)]
*  very different perspectives on AI. There's the perspective about risks and safety. Well, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=186.16000000000003s)]
*  and then there's the American perspective, which is on opportunities and aspirations. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=193.24s)]
*  And if you look at Mr. Modi's remarks today, he's clearly focused that we should not just [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=197.60000000000002s)]
*  overly be concerned about the risks, but we should also look at the potential opportunities. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=203.32000000000002s)]
*  There's something that he has led by example. He's been someone who's been a pioneer in [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=209.28s)]
*  experimenting with new technologies. Though he was a victim himself of AI-based deepfakes [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=214.20000000000002s)]
*  during the election campaign, he was also the first one to use AI for his political [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=220.08s)]
*  speeches, translating them in multiple Indian languages. So again, a leader who has shown [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=226.04000000000002s)]
*  that don't just be focused on the risks and the downsides of AI, but also look at the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=232.12s)]
*  potential opportunities. And he was talking there in the clip that we played about the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=237.84s)]
*  potential for new jobs and that obviously there's a huge fear around mass job losses [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=243.28s)]
*  and what that could do to the structure of societies and its human connection. What is [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=248.6s)]
*  India actually doing policy-wise on that? Where do you think the new jobs are coming? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=254.32s)]
*  Because Mr. Modi talked about upskilling and re-skilling the population. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=260.0s)]
*  Sure. So if you look at the focus of the Modi government on AI, it has centered around what [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=263.92s)]
*  is called the India AI mission. It has broadly three areas of focus. The first is on building [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=270.36s)]
*  compute capacity within India. So there's a whole program to build a cloud-based public-private [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=276.84s)]
*  partnership model for providing compute capacity for AI developers and researchers. So that is one [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=283.48s)]
*  aspect of the program. The other is, of course, making publicly available data sets so that [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=290.92s)]
*  models are built with Indian data, Indian context in mind. And that's opening up an entire area of [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=297.08000000000004s)]
*  opportunity, not only on the AI development side, but more importantly, on the data enrichment side. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=302.92s)]
*  And that's a sweet spot for India, which has traditionally provided IT services, business [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=309.64s)]
*  processing, outsourcing services, and global capability centers. So there's a big opportunity [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=315.48s)]
*  there in curating data sets, enriching them, making them AI ready. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=321.08000000000004s)]
*  Just 10 seconds. Is it dangerous that the US and the UK didn't sign at the end? 10 seconds. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=328.36s)]
*  No, I don't think so. I think it's a conversation and I think Mr. Modi is going to the US tomorrow. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=334.28000000000003s)]
*  I'm sure the conversation will continue when the summit comes back to India. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=339.96000000000004s)]
*  Okay, Shashi Shekhar, Vimpati, thank you very much indeed for being with us. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gTV1Az6qiw&t=343.0s)]
