**BBC - The Latest:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI)
*  Let's take you live now to Istanbul in Turkey. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=0.0s)]
*  And these are protests after the arrest of President Erdogan's main rival, the mayor of Istanbul. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=4.08s)]
*  There have been two days of protests, actually. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  Now, President Erdogan said he won't tolerate threats to public order. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=15.6s)]
*  He says Turkey won't give in to what he calls vandalism and street terror. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=20.56s)]
*  But the mayor of Istanbul, who was detained on Wednesday, along with others from his party, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=26.24s)]
*  had been expected to be formally named as that party their presidential candidate for the CHP [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=32.64s)]
*  party. Now, further protests are expected. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=40.56s)]
*  Let's get the very latest then on what's going on in Turkey after that arrest, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  and we can talk to our reporter, Emily Wither. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=48.8s)]
*  Emily, just bring us up to date with what's happening. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=51.44s)]
*  At the moment, there's a bit of a war of words going on between the leader of the opposition [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  party, Özgür Ozil. Now, that's the party that Ekrem Ememoli belongs to, and President Erdogan. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=58.88s)]
*  There was a bit of a turning point last night, because for the first time, the opposition party, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=66.16s)]
*  the CHP, directly called for people to go onto the streets. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  This statement was made by the head of the opposition party, Özgür Ozil. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=74.80000000000001s)]
*  He delivered a big speech to Istanbul, to crowds that were gathered in protest, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  outside the municipality building, which was Ememoli's office. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=83.91999999999999s)]
*  And I'll just read you directly what he said. He said, hey, Erdogan, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=87.44s)]
*  you're most scared of the streets. We are now on the streets. We are in the squares. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=91.03999999999999s)]
*  Continue to be afraid. So that was the first direct call from the opposition [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=96.24s)]
*  for people to come out onto the streets. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  We then heard in the last hour or so from President Erdogan. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=103.19999999999999s)]
*  He was speaking at an event here in Istanbul, and he hit back. He said that [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=106.96s)]
*  the CHP, the street that the CHP, the opposition party, are talking about, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=112.72s)]
*  is a dead-end street. This is street terrorism, which is a very clear warning to protesters, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=117.2s)]
*  because the government has banned public demonstrations and gatherings for the next [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=123.84s)]
*  couple of days. That's now been extended into next week. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=128.56s)]
*  And we are seeing quite a heavy police crackdown. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=132.24s)]
*  Last night, police used water cannons, tear gas, and what we suspect is rubber bullets. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=135.44s)]
*  And that warning, calling it terrorism, suggests that there will be more arrests [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=142.4s)]
*  on the streets as well if people go out and protest. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=146.56s)]
*  So a real showdown, really, between the president and his supporters [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=149.28s)]
*  and the opposition and those protesters? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  Absolutely. And I think we might see that showdown potentially come to a head this [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  weekend, because a couple of key things are going to happen. Firstly, it's the weekend, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=161.84s)]
*  which means we might see more demonstrators come out onto the streets, even though there are tens [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=166.0s)]
*  of thousands of people on the streets. It is mostly students. And this is a city of over 16 [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=170.96s)]
*  million people. And so the numbers are not quite large enough, I think, to put real pressure on [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=176.96s)]
*  President Erdogan. We could see those numbers build now into the weekend with people not working, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=182.08s)]
*  and also because the opposition party has called them to the streets. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  The other thing that will happen is the CHP, the opposition party, is still expected to name [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=191.84s)]
*  Imumolu, regardless of what happens to him, their presidential challenger in any future elections. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=198.08s)]
*  We will also likely hear on Saturday or Sunday whether Ekrem Imumolu is going to be charged [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=204.96s)]
*  or whether he will be released. I think the feeling is that he will be charged and he could [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=211.6s)]
*  end up going to jail. There's one other thing that's going to happen on Sunday. The CHP, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=217.04s)]
*  the opposition party, has called for a symbolic vote. So that means they're also calling people [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=222.72s)]
*  to come and vote for Imumolu in ballot boxes that they're setting up all over towns and cities [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=228.64s)]
*  across the country. This is going to be a symbolic vote to show support for this detained Mayor Ekrem [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=234.32s)]
*  Imumolu. OK, Emily, thank you so much for that update. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyugyNO-dTI&t=240.48s)]
