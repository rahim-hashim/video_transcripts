# Signal chat journalist speaks to BBC. #Signal #Trump #BBCNews
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXc5B763Db4)
*  What's going on here? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXc5B763Db4&t=0.0s)]
*  Why'd you even invite me to the chat? [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXc5B763Db4&t=1.76s)]
*  Clearly, if Pete Hegseth, the Secretary of Defense, is texting me, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXc5B763Db4&t=4.32s)]
*  telling me that an attack is about to be launched on Yemen, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXc5B763Db4&t=8.84s)]
*  and telling me what kind of aircraft are going to be used, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXc5B763Db4&t=12.0s)]
*  and what kind of weapons are going to be used, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXc5B763Db4&t=14.68s)]
*  and when the bombs are going to fall, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXc5B763Db4&t=16.44s)]
*  two hours after the email, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXc5B763Db4&t=18.84s)]
*  two hours after the text is received, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXc5B763Db4&t=20.76s)]
*  that seems sensitive information, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXc5B763Db4&t=23.56s)]
*  sensitive war planning information to me. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXc5B763Db4&t=26.12s)]
*  Once Donald Trump said there was nothing to see here, essentially, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXc5B763Db4&t=27.96s)]
*  and once Tulsi Gabbard, the Director of National Intelligence, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXc5B763Db4&t=31.44s)]
*  and John Ratcliffe, the head of the CIA, all said, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXc5B763Db4&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  there's no sensitive information there, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXc5B763Db4&t=36.88s)]
*  no classified information, etc. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXc5B763Db4&t=38.32s)]
*  Well, we felt like, hmm, well, we disagree, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXc5B763Db4&t=40.6s)]
*  and they're saying that, and we're the ones who have the email, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXc5B763Db4&t=44.040000000000006s)]
*  so the text, so maybe people should see them. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXc5B763Db4&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  You know, they didn't come back with anything substantive. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXc5B763Db4&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  Some of them didn't even answer our queries. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXc5B763Db4&t=52.56s)]
*  And at a certain point, the public interest comes into play, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXc5B763Db4&t=56.12s)]
*  and we felt like the people of the United States [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXc5B763Db4&t=59.04s)]
*  should read these texts from their leaders themselves, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXc5B763Db4&t=62.12s)]
*  and then make the decision if this was a wise thing to do, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXc5B763Db4&t=66.64s)]
*  to do this on signal. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXc5B763Db4&t=69.72s)]
