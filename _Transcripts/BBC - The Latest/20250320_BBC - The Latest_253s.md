Video Description: President Donald Trump has suggested the US could take ownership of power plants in Ukraine to ensure their security.

White House officials said the proposal came in Trump's phone call with Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday - but the Ukrainian president says only the Zaporizhzhia plant was discussed.

Zelensky said lasting peace was achievable this year after the "positive" phone call. Trump described the phone call as "very good".

Meanwhile, the UK will be holding talks later today with senior military officers from countries interested in a proposed peacekeeping force for Ukraine.

*  President Zelensky and President Trump, which was very important for both leaders given [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dANuT9bM-U&t=103.78s)]
*  their last conversation was in the Oval Office. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dANuT9bM-U&t=109.26s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. I mean, it's the Americans, for all their suggestions of heading in different [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dANuT9bM-U&t=113.18s)]
*  directions are going to remain important in this process. So it's very important for Ukraine, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dANuT9bM-U&t=120.9s)]
*  as I think other leaders such as Prime Minister Stammer have sort of impressed upon them to [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dANuT9bM-U&t=127.42s)]
*  keep close to them and have productive relations with them. So, yes, that was an important [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dANuT9bM-U&t=133.54s)]
*  development. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dANuT9bM-U&t=140.94s)]
*  What do you make of this idea of the US owning certain key power plants in Ukraine? I mean, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dANuT9bM-U&t=141.94s)]
*  President Zelensky saying they really only discussed the Zaporozhye nuclear plant, but [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dANuT9bM-U&t=150.98s)]
*  the idea that they would be safer if owned by the US? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dANuT9bM-U&t=155.5s)]
*  It's a little bit odd that maybe it's the kind of business money, whilst for most of [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dANuT9bM-U&t=161.18s)]
*  his life President Trump's instinct always seems to go towards kind of acquiring some [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dANuT9bM-U&t=166.54000000000002s)]
*  kind of property in the process. But if they were specifically talking about the Zaporozhye [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dANuT9bM-U&t=172.58s)]
*  plant, which is currently occupied by Russia, then perhaps it's an idea worth exploring. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dANuT9bM-U&t=179.34s)]
*  I think if that was as far as we could get for now, it would be a big game for Ukraine [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dANuT9bM-U&t=186.86s)]
*  if the Americans were running that plan rather than the Russians, which comes with obviously [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dANuT9bM-U&t=191.86s)]
*  all kinds of dangers. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dANuT9bM-U&t=198.74s)]
*  I mean, it's not an operational plant at the moment, and it's said to take at least a few [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dANuT9bM-U&t=200.62s)]
*  years before it could be up and running fully again anyway. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dANuT9bM-U&t=205.58s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's the case. But even nuclear plants that were only until recently [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dANuT9bM-U&t=210.3s)]
*  operated still require quite a lot, as does I understand it. I'm not a scientist, but [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dANuT9bM-U&t=218.06s)]
*  to keep them in a safe condition, there is still a lot that needs to happen. And I think [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dANuT9bM-U&t=223.94s)]
*  it's fairly clear that Russians cannot be trusted with that, even if it was passed over [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dANuT9bM-U&t=230.98000000000002s)]
*  to US operation would be not inclined to attack it at least, and you would have probably sensible [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dANuT9bM-U&t=238.42s)]
*  people actually controlling the material and the facility there. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dANuT9bM-U&t=246.14s)]
