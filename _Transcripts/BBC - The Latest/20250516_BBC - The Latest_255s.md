Video Description: US Secretary of State Marco Rubio says the US is "troubled" by the humanitarian situation in Gaza.
 
At least 140 Palestinians were reported killed since Thursday in Israeli air strikes, according to Gazan health officials.
 
Gaza has been under a complete Israeli blockade of all food and other humanitarian supplies for 10 weeks, and Israel has intensified its bombardment ahead of a planned expansion of their ground offensive in Gaza.
 
The US is Israel's main arms supplier and the language used by Rubio is unusual, but comes amid recent reports of a rift between US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

*  Well, the US Secretary of State says that the Trump administration was troubled by the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zNabmYO-DY&t=0.0s)]
*  humanitarian situation in Gaza, reeling under a total Israeli blockade. He spoke as at least [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zNabmYO-DY&t=5.2s)]
*  120 Palestinians were reported killed in Israeli airstrikes since Thursday. Israel says it's [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zNabmYO-DY&t=12.24s)]
*  targeting Hamas and that it will continue with plans to expand its offensive in the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zNabmYO-DY&t=19.64s)]
*  territory over the coming days. Though many victims were women and children in displacement [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zNabmYO-DY&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  camps, Israel says that the strikes were against legitimate militant targets. Mohamed Taha [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zNabmYO-DY&t=29.88s)]
*  is from BBC Arabic and he has more on the Israeli strikes that continue across Gaza. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zNabmYO-DY&t=36.92s)]
*  In Gaza, on the south, in Khan Yunis and Rafah, and on the north in Jabalia, Beit Leahya and [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zNabmYO-DY&t=44.2s)]
*  Beit Hanun, and I can say comfortably, however, Israel announced that they will start expanding [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zNabmYO-DY&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  the military operation in Gaza on Sunday. This expansion started from last night. So [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zNabmYO-DY&t=58.28s)]
*  the reports are coming from Gaza, from the north are telling us that the Israel ground [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zNabmYO-DY&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  forces are advancing towards this Jabalia, Beit Leahya. They are asking the women to [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zNabmYO-DY&t=71.08s)]
*  be separated from men, arresting some men, and then expanding the operation this way, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zNabmYO-DY&t=76.06s)]
*  asking the people to evacuate the north, including Al-Shifa Hospital north in the city of Gaza [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zNabmYO-DY&t=83.64s)]
*  and the Islamic University in the north as well, where there are many, many displaced [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zNabmYO-DY&t=89.64s)]
*  people are there. I mean, some of the descriptions on social media and also being reported of [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zNabmYO-DY&t=95.64s)]
*  the results of those strikes, I mean, are really, really quite upsetting, particularly [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zNabmYO-DY&t=103.36s)]
*  on the medical camp. What has the United States, Marco Rubio, said on this matter so far? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zNabmYO-DY&t=108.92s)]
*  Indeed, he said that the United States is troubled, but apparently troubled is not enough. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zNabmYO-DY&t=115.92s)]
*  As the United States, this trouble that the United States is feeling is not pushing them [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zNabmYO-DY&t=122.18s)]
*  to take a tougher stance towards the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zNabmYO-DY&t=128.66s)]
*  willingness to continue this war without any hope to reach ceasefire, to release the hostages. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zNabmYO-DY&t=134.82000000000002s)]
*  So amongst the Trump visit to the Middle East, we didn't see any big announcement regarding [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zNabmYO-DY&t=143.46s)]
*  Gaza. We saw big announcement regarding Syria, the lifting of sanctions or the meeting of [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zNabmYO-DY&t=150.98000000000002s)]
*  the president, the Syrian president. We saw announcement related to Iran. We saw announcement [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zNabmYO-DY&t=158.45999999999998s)]
*  related to the Houthis, but Gaza wasn't on the top of the agenda of Trump's visit to [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zNabmYO-DY&t=165.62s)]
*  the Middle East. This made people are really angry on social media. They are putting the [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zNabmYO-DY&t=171.45999999999998s)]
*  image of Donald Trump along with the image of the dead people in Gaza, saying that they [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zNabmYO-DY&t=176.7s)]
*  are dying at the end of the day by American ammunition. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zNabmYO-DY&t=182.62s)]
*  If this offensive continues and nothing is agreed as part of the negotiations, Sunday [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zNabmYO-DY&t=187.74s)]
*  is the deadline, we had that warning from the UN of an imminent famine. I mean, things [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zNabmYO-DY&t=193.12s)]
*  are very serious, aren't they? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zNabmYO-DY&t=200.24s)]
*  Well the people in Gaza are in more than few weeks they don't get any aid, any food, any [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zNabmYO-DY&t=202.82000000000002s)]
*  clean water or any medical equipment. This is not a secret. This is not something under [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zNabmYO-DY&t=210.82s)]
*  the table. This is something that the Israeli government are announcing. Now the position [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zNabmYO-DY&t=217.62s)]
*  of the Israeli government and the US government is that a private company should take over [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zNabmYO-DY&t=222.7s)]
*  the distribution of the aid in Gaza. The UN says that this will not work, this will not [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zNabmYO-DY&t=228.34s)]
*  be efficient and the aid will not be distributed efficiently on all people, but the United [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zNabmYO-DY&t=235.02s)]
*  States and Israel are apparently saying this is the only way not to make the aid fall in [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zNabmYO-DY&t=242.06s)]
*  the hands of Hamas and amongst all of that. People are dying from hunger more than dying [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zNabmYO-DY&t=247.82000000000002s)]
*  from the Israeli attacks. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zNabmYO-DY&t=252.9s)]
