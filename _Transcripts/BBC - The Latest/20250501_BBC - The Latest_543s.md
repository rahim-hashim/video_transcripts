Video Description: US National Security Adviser Mike Waltz is leaving his post with the Trump adminstration, according to media reports.
 
Waltz, who was the president's principal adviser on national security issues, has had a difficult tenure amid accusations that senior officials used insecure methods of communication to conduct government business.
 
Last month, he took responsibility for a group chat on the Signal messaging app in which high-ranking officials planned military strikes in Yemen in the company of a journalist who was inadvertently added.
 
Waltz's deputy Alex Nelson Wong has also reportedly been removed from his post in what appears to be a shakeup of the US' security establishment.

# Mike Waltz to leave national security adviser role, US media reports | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s)
*  I want to return to the breaking news coming out of Washington that the National Security [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=0.0s)]
*  Advisor Mike Waltz and his deputy are reported to be leaving their post. There you see it [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=4.4s)]
*  on the screen. CBS, our partner in America, reporting that in terms of sources talking [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=10.0s)]
*  to them. And let's speak to Tom Bateman, our State Department correspondent. And Tom, let [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=17.0s)]
*  me start by asking you about this breaking news. We'll come to that resources deal a [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=22.6s)]
*  little later. But these are the first casualties of this Trump administration for people who [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=26.68s)]
*  perhaps don't know some of the background. Just remind people about that whole huge controversy [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=34.08s)]
*  around the Signal Chat group. Yeah, absolutely. And first of all, to let you know that the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=40.0s)]
*  White House being asked about this, as you would imagine at the moment, saying that it [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=47.92s)]
*  on reports from anonymous sources. But as you say, our colleagues at CBS, quoting several [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=52.52s)]
*  sources saying that Mike Waltz and Alex Wong will leave their positions today. And as you [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=59.28s)]
*  say, that would be a highly significant moment, the first to leave their post in any senior [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=65.2s)]
*  official position in this second Trump administration. Now, as for Mike Waltz, it's interesting that [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=72.52000000000001s)]
*  we've heard a lot less from him publicly. He's been a lot less publicly visible over [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=79.84s)]
*  the last few weeks, having gone from a position of really high visibility in the administration. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=84.44000000000001s)]
*  I mean, I remember being in the room as a group of journalists interviewed him and Marco [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=89.92s)]
*  Rubio, the Secretary of State in Saudi Arabia, when the administration had just met the Russians, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  the first meeting between the US administration and the Russians in quite a significant amount [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=101.68s)]
*  of time. So he was at the highest profile levels of foreign policy for the administration. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=107.24s)]
*  And then we had March, which was that Signal Chat that was set up by Mike Waltz, the National [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=112.39999999999999s)]
*  Security Advisor, included several high level officials in that and others working for them. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=119.6s)]
*  And he had mistakenly included Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of the Atlantic magazine, who then [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=128.6s)]
*  broke the story about how this Signal Chat had been set up in which Pete Hegseth, the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=133.62s)]
*  defence secretary, shared what the administration denied was classified information, but was [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=138.14s)]
*  clearly attack plans for the bombing of Houthi positions in Yemen. But not only that row [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=143.89999999999998s)]
*  about classified information being used on a commercial chat application at the most [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=151.89999999999998s)]
*  of the US administration, but also sort of deeply embarrassing internal discussions between [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=158.62s)]
*  the members of the administration about, first of all, whether they wanted to go ahead with [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=165.14000000000001s)]
*  this plan to bomb the Houthis, because some members of the administration, particularly [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=169.98000000000002s)]
*  JD Vance, the vice president, and Pete Hegseth, the defence secretary, had been concerned [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=174.94s)]
*  about whether or not they were bailing out the Europeans, getting access through the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=181.86s)]
*  Suez Canal for trade routes that they argued were more beneficial to the Europeans than [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=186.38000000000002s)]
*  them. And you saw this discussion between JD Vance and Pete Hegseth, the defence secretary, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=191.22s)]
*  where the Europeans were described as pathetic, as freeloaders, and that there was a disdain [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=197.06s)]
*  for doing anything that would help the Europeans, but a sense that they would sort of be asked [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=203.74s)]
*  to pay for it later. So it had significant diplomatic and geopolitical consequences. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=208.02s)]
*  In the aftermath of that, questions started to emerge about whether Mike Walz's position [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=215.3s)]
*  was tenable. Donald Trump had come to his defence, described him as a good man when [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=219.9s)]
*  he was asked about it, seemed to sort of brush it away and dismiss it. But clearly behind [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=225.94s)]
*  the scenes, I think the president was asking a lot of questions about it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=230.38s)]
*  Tom, I just break in because we're looking at pictures of JD Vance at the Andrews Air [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=233.62s)]
*  Base, and he was heading towards the cameras, but now he's clamoured aboard the steps to [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=238.82s)]
*  the aircraft. He's on the phone, and I thought he might be, a question or two might be shouted [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=245.22s)]
*  out at him, but he hasn't been. Tom, I'll come back to you in a second, but I want to [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=252.04s)]
*  actually just bring in Bernd de Boesman, who is there at the White House for us. He's actually [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=255.29999999999998s)]
*  on the phone, and Bernd, Tom was just saying questions are being asked there at the White [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=260.98s)]
*  House about this breaking development. What are they saying officially? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=266.38s)]
*  Well, officially, they're not commenting on anonymous reporting, which has kind of become [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=271.74s)]
*  a standard line when there's reports from anonymous sources in US media. Now, behind [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=275.94s)]
*  closed doors, the perception is that something of this magnitude would almost certainly come [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=282.38s)]
*  from the mouth of the president himself. So all the all eyes and ears will be on President [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=286.38s)]
*  Trump. He has an event coming up just in a few minutes, a prayer event here at the White [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=290.66s)]
*  House. And then he later today, he's scheduled to fly to Alabama to give a commencement [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=294.86s)]
*  speech at a university. And there'll be a lot of questions being asked about him. But [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=300.54s)]
*  really, at the moment, the White House has been very, very quiet about this late breaking [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=305.66s)]
*  development. Was there a sense there amongst reporters, amongst the media that this was on [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=309.5s)]
*  the cards because there was just an enormous amount of scrutiny, an enormous amount of calls [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=317.06s)]
*  for a sacking at the time, but then it went quiet. And now this development. But had [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=323.86s)]
*  reporters seen it coming? Or is this a surprise? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=330.65999999999997s)]
*  I think most reporters here at the White House wouldn't be surprised if this is confirmed to [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=335.46s)]
*  be the case, particularly after Signalgate. Mr. Walz kind of seemed to disappear. Prior to [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=339.94s)]
*  that, he was kind of a very frequent fixture here outside the White House. He would often give early [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=346.02s)]
*  morning interviews to the television network before coming to address the reporters who were [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=351.3s)]
*  here at the time. This happened several times a week. But after Signalgate, which ultimately, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=356.90000000000003s)]
*  I think it's something that many observers here blamed him for adding Jeffrey Goldberg to the [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=362.42s)]
*  signals chat that was later publicized, he was kind of seen as being as the man responsible for [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=367.22s)]
*  that. And then he became kind of a much quieter presence at the White House. He would be at the [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=373.3s)]
*  events such as yesterday's cabinet meeting, but we would rarely hear from him in media [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=377.54s)]
*  interviews after that took place. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=381.14000000000004s)]
*  Let me go back to Tom Bateman. Tom, in terms of the choreography of this, why wasn't he fired [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=384.38s)]
*  pretty much immediately? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=393.18s)]
*  Well, that was a question that President Trump had been asked from the outset about this, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=396.90000000000003s)]
*  because such was the concern about the use of a commercial messaging chat app to discuss what were [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=401.54s)]
*  clearly, although the administration denied it, classified attack plans, the way in which it was [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=412.1s)]
*  set up with a whole series of individuals on the group, including the sort of aides to senior [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=419.62s)]
*  officials. You know, the question was kind of immediately asked about this appeared to be a [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=425.54s)]
*  kind of resignable or resigning offense because of what had taken place. But I think it was pretty [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=432.34000000000003s)]
*  clear that President Trump was perhaps waiting this out to see if the clamor died down and how [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=437.94s)]
*  survivable perhaps Mike Walz was in his position. The timing, of course, why now this lay into the [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=446.58000000000004s)]
*  situation is, I think, a second question about what has happened since then. And actually, at the [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=454.58s)]
*  moment that we've seen one of the highest profile foreign policy announcements that the [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=460.18s)]
*  administration has wanted to champion because they have just signed that minerals deal with the [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=465.94s)]
*  Ukrainians. That's something Donald Trump had been pressing for weeks. It led to that row in the Oval [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=471.62s)]
*  Office, the sort of humiliating attack on President Zelensky by President Trump and the [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=479.22s)]
*  Vice President, J.D. Vance at that moment. So actually now is a moment where they've really [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=485.46000000000004s)]
*  been sort of hailing and championing what they see as a big success in foreign policy, a big moment [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=490.90000000000003s)]
*  for them about the signing of this deal. So whether there's a connection between the way these things [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=495.94000000000005s)]
*  are being choreographed, I think another question. We'll have to wait to see exactly what President [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=501.14000000000004s)]
*  Trump says. And of course, if we get any word from Mike Walz himself. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=505.62s)]
*  Tom, we will leave it there. Thanks very much for taking us through just the early analysis [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=510.02s)]
*  of that breaking story. And Bernt, too, thank you there from the White House. And as Bernt was saying, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=515.46s)]
*  President Trump, due at a live event, a prayer event, I think he described it as in the next [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=521.78s)]
*  few minutes. And as both our correspondents were saying, news like this would, you would expect, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=526.9s)]
*  come from the President himself in terms of confirmation. So perhaps we might get that [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=532.98s)]
*  in the coming minutes. We'll keep an eye on that live event that the President is doing. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO_DJ9Jl05s&t=537.86s)]
