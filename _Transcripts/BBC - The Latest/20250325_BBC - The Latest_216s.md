Video Description: The cryptocurrency company Gridless is planning to build more mini power plants plants in rural villages across Africa, in order to bring electricity to remote areas and to mine for bitcoin.

Gridless already has six sites like this in Kenya, Malawi, and Zambia.

The company still faces resistance from some authorities and companies which see bitcoin as an energy-greedy and selfish use of electricity that might otherwise be used by rural people.

The environmental impact of the industry is also a major concern. It's estimated that bitcoin mining uses as much energy as a small country like Poland.

The BBCâ€™s Joe Tidy visited a mine in Zambia on the Zambezi river to see how one of the projects work.

# Bitcoin mining in Zambia | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfwLy8MWbe4)
*  A cryptocurrency company is planning to roll out mini power plants to rural villages in Africa. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfwLy8MWbe4&t=0.0s)]
*  It's in order to bring electricity to remote parts and to mine for Bitcoin. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfwLy8MWbe4&t=6.8s)]
*  The company has already proven that a similar model works after installing Bitcoin-generating mines [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfwLy8MWbe4&t=11.6s)]
*  to six different renewable energy plants in three different countries. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfwLy8MWbe4&t=17.6s)]
*  The project shows the potential benefits of this controversial energy-hungry system that powers Bitcoin. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfwLy8MWbe4&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  Joe Tidy has been to the remote mine on the Zambezi River to see one project in action. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfwLy8MWbe4&t=28.599999999999998s)]
*  The roar of the Zambezi River is deafening. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfwLy8MWbe4&t=36.4s)]
*  But there's another sound on the riverbanks here in northwest Zambia too. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfwLy8MWbe4&t=40.8s)]
*  The unmistakable whirring of a Bitcoin mine. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfwLy8MWbe4&t=44.8s)]
*  24 hours a day, this container full of powerful computers crunches through complex mathematical problems [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfwLy8MWbe4&t=48.8s)]
*  to earn Bitcoins as part of the global volunteer mining network. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfwLy8MWbe4&t=55.8s)]
*  It's very noisy, but it's a beautiful noise. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfwLy8MWbe4&t=59.8s)]
*  Because the truth is, this noise means we're making money. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfwLy8MWbe4&t=62.8s)]
*  It's an odd place for a high-tech crypto operation, but it makes sense as the electricity is so cheap here [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfwLy8MWbe4&t=66.8s)]
*  as it comes directly from the site's hydroelectric power plant. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfwLy8MWbe4&t=72.8s)]
*  Zengamina Hydro has been running for 17 years, but the Bitcoin mine has been a major boost since it was installed in 2023. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfwLy8MWbe4&t=77.8s)]
*  As it makes use of excess electricity. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfwLy8MWbe4&t=84.8s)]
*  We really struggled to make ends meet. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfwLy8MWbe4&t=87.8s)]
*  And every day we were wasting over 50% of the energy that we could generate, which also meant we're not earning from that. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfwLy8MWbe4&t=89.8s)]
*  What we lacked was an institutional, a major user of power in the area. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfwLy8MWbe4&t=97.8s)]
*  And the extra revenue, important to say, has also helped us keep the prices down for what we charge the local people, which is also very important. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfwLy8MWbe4&t=102.8s)]
*  A few miles away from the hydro plant, Damien only got power to his barber shop a couple of years ago, but it's been transformational. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfwLy8MWbe4&t=112.8s)]
*  Bitcoin mining didn't build Zengamina Hydro plant, but there's no doubt it's been a win. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfwLy8MWbe4&t=132.8s)]
*  Not just for the energy company and the Bitcoin miners, but also for the local town. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfwLy8MWbe4&t=137.8s)]
*  However, the plant has received a huge amount of investment and will soon be expanding. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfwLy8MWbe4&t=142.8s)]
*  They hope to sell any excess energy eventually back to the grid. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfwLy8MWbe4&t=146.8s)]
*  So Philip and team have got to hit the road and find a new place as perfect as this. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfwLy8MWbe4&t=150.8s)]
*  As well as searching for sites with excess energy, Gridless is now hoping to start building its own mini grid energy plants. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfwLy8MWbe4&t=158.8s)]
*  With its Bitcoin mine as the first major tenant. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfwLy8MWbe4&t=165.8s)]
*  I'm sure you'll have critics who will worry that the community want the energy, but you'll favor the mining. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfwLy8MWbe4&t=168.8s)]
*  It's a really good question and you're right, we get to ask that a lot. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfwLy8MWbe4&t=176.8s)]
*  The truth is that Bitcoin mining doesn't pay very high prices for electricity. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfwLy8MWbe4&t=180.8s)]
*  Our economic interest is to sell to the higher paying customer and that's always going to be the community. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfwLy8MWbe4&t=185.8s)]
*  But because of Bitcoin's reputation for energy use and environmental impact, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfwLy8MWbe4&t=191.8s)]
*  some governments and authorities remain uncomfortable with including it in electrification projects. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfwLy8MWbe4&t=195.8s)]
*  Setups like Zengamina are a tiny part of the overall mining picture, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfwLy8MWbe4&t=201.8s)]
*  but also a rare example of a controversial industry creating much more than just digital coins. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfwLy8MWbe4&t=206.8s)]
*  Joe Tidy, BBC News, in Zambia. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfwLy8MWbe4&t=213.8s)]
