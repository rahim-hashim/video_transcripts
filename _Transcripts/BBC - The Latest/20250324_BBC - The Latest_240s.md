Video Description: Greenland's politicians have condemned plans for high-profile US visits, in the wake of President Donald Trump's threats to take over the island.
 
Second Lady Usha Vance will make a cultural visit this week, and a separate trip is expected from Trump's National Security Adviser Mike Waltz.
 
Outgoing Greenlandic Prime Minister Mute Egede described the plan as aggressive, and said the duo had not been invited for meetings. Meanwhile, the island's likely next leader accused the US of showing a lack of respect.
 
Greenland - the world's biggest island, situated between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans - has been controlled by Denmark, nearly 3,000km (1,860 miles) away, for about 300 years.

# Greenland condemns planned visits by Usha Vance and Trump adviser | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8M0P6R51qA)
*  And let's turn to that because the Prime Minister of Greenland has condemned a planned visit to the island by the wife of the US Vice President and senior US politicians as quote a provocation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8M0P6R51qA&t=0.0s)]
*  It comes after the second leader, Usha Vance, said she'd be traveling to the semi-autonomous Danish territory with a delegation to visit historic sites and attend the annual dogsled race. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8M0P6R51qA&t=11.28s)]
*  The White House National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz, will also be on the trip and visit a US military base. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8M0P6R51qA&t=23.6s)]
*  President Trump has made the US annexation of Greenland a major talking point. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8M0P6R51qA&t=29.48s)]
*  Well, let's head to Washington and North America, correspondent, Nomiye Iqbal. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8M0P6R51qA&t=34.88s)]
*  And Nomiye, I read out the quotes there from the Premier of Greenland. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8M0P6R51qA&t=39.160000000000004s)]
*  The Danish foreign minister just in the last 10 minutes has described this visit as inappropriate. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8M0P6R51qA&t=44.92s)]
*  In terms of the White House, what are they saying about the nature of this visit? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8M0P6R51qA&t=51.88s)]
*  Well, first of all, the second lady, Usha Vance, even though it's a private visit, a private event, she's going with her son. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8M0P6R51qA&t=60.040000000000006s)]
*  She announced it on her official social media account. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8M0P6R51qA&t=68.44s)]
*  So it seems quite contradictory in that sense. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8M0P6R51qA&t=72.36s)]
*  I mean, she's not traveling with a press pool or anything like that. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8M0P6R51qA&t=76.56s)]
*  It is a private visit. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8M0P6R51qA&t=79.32000000000001s)]
*  In terms of the White House, let me just read to you what they have said. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8M0P6R51qA&t=81.16000000000001s)]
*  And this actually came from the National Security, so the NSC spokesman, Brian Hughes. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8M0P6R51qA&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  And he said that the US has a vested security interest in the Arctic region and it should not be a surprise [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8M0P6R51qA&t=90.88000000000001s)]
*  the National Security Advisor and the Secretary of Energy are visiting a US space base to get first hand [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8M0P6R51qA&t=95.84s)]
*  briefings from our service members on the ground. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8M0P6R51qA&t=101.44s)]
*  But, you know, let's I think the view is that Donald Trump is sending Usha Vance, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8M0P6R51qA&t=105.48s)]
*  who is someone that has taken a very much backseat to the administration. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8M0P6R51qA&t=113.64s)]
*  She is pretty quiet. She's low profile. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8M0P6R51qA&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  She is seen as somewhat of a charm offensive to go to Greenland, a country he wants to try and govern. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8M0P6R51qA&t=121.48s)]
*  Just to remind, you know, it's long been in Donald Trump's sights. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8M0P6R51qA&t=129.84s)]
*  He talked about Greenland in his first administration, trying to acquire the territory from Denmark. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8M0P6R51qA&t=133.4s)]
*  But it's only recently that he started to become much more serious about the endeavor. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8M0P6R51qA&t=140.28s)]
*  And the fact that the second lady is going and the fact that Mike Walsh is reportedly going suggests [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8M0P6R51qA&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  that he is incredibly serious about it. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8M0P6R51qA&t=152.20000000000002s)]
*  Yes. And when you listen to the president in this administration, he has talked about taking over Greenland [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8M0P6R51qA&t=155.24s)]
*  and saying that he's ruling nothing out economic or military means. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8M0P6R51qA&t=160.96s)]
*  Meanwhile, the vice president did interview with Fox saying that Denmark isn't being a good ally. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8M0P6R51qA&t=165.72s)]
*  Not being a good ally. How, Nomiya? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8M0P6R51qA&t=173.76s)]
*  Well, I guess it's the criticism, right? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8M0P6R51qA&t=179.36s)]
*  It's the fact that Denmark has been critical towards the US in that respect and not [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8M0P6R51qA&t=181.12s)]
*  wanting to negotiate with President Trump. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8M0P6R51qA&t=188.92000000000002s)]
*  You know, we see the way President Trump approaches foreign policy. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8M0P6R51qA&t=191.64000000000001s)]
*  Everything is up, it would seem, for sale, up for negotiation. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8M0P6R51qA&t=196.16s)]
*  And the fact that Denmark's been critical about it and made it quite clear that that they will not be [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8M0P6R51qA&t=199.24s)]
*  negotiating with Mr. Trump when it comes to Greenland is probably why they think that Mr. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8M0P6R51qA&t=205.84s)]
*  Vance thinks that they're not being a good ally. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8M0P6R51qA&t=211.48000000000002s)]
*  But, you know, just to reiterate, the US's argument on this is that, look, we have a base there. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8M0P6R51qA&t=214.92s)]
*  And so we have a right to to go there. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8M0P6R51qA&t=220.35999999999999s)]
*  But the fact that the lady sorry, the fact that Usher Vance, the second lady is going, I think is [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8M0P6R51qA&t=223.68s)]
*  even though it's not in an official capacity, as I as they have said, it's a private visit. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8M0P6R51qA&t=232.32s)]
*  The fact that she's going, I think, says a lot. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8M0P6R51qA&t=236.64s)]
