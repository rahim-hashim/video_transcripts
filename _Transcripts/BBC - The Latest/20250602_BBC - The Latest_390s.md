Video Description: Russian and Ukrainian delegations have arrived in Istanbul for a second round of peace talks. Both sides will present documents outlining their ceasefire demands. 
 
The meeting is still going ahead despite Ukraine's attack that destroyed 13 Russian bomber planes in a live scale drone attack on Russian airbases on Sunday. 
An earlier round of talks in Istanbul last month failed to bring about any significant outcome apart from a prisoner of war swap.

# Russia and Ukraine trade fire hours before Istanbul peace talks | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY)
*  Russian and Ukrainian delegations have arrived in Istanbul for a second round of peace talks. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=0.0s)]
*  Both sides will present documents outlining their ceasefire demands. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  The meeting is still going ahead despite Ukraine destroying 40 Russian bomber planes [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  in a large-scale drone attack on Russian air bases on Sunday. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=16.56s)]
*  This video appears to show the attack as drones were launched from inside Russia. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=21.2s)]
*  President Zelensky says Operation Spiderweb took more than a year and a half to plan [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=26.16s)]
*  and described it as absolutely brilliant. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=31.44s)]
*  The scale of the operation is vast, with the strikes hitting at least [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=35.04s)]
*  four different airfields from western Russia, Moscow and reaching the country's far east, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  thousands of miles from Ukraine. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=45.6s)]
*  Russia's defence ministry has said it shot down 162 Ukrainian drones [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=48.08s)]
*  fired overnight after Ukraine launched attacks on Russia's Kursk region that borders Ukraine. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=53.76s)]
*  Our correspondents Paul Adams in Kiev and Hugo Bashega in Istanbul [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  have been looking at the details of this latest round of Ukrainian strikes [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=66.72s)]
*  and what impacts they might have on any prospective peace deal. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=70.8s)]
*  We only have an account from Ukrainian sources on how this was conducted and they obviously [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=75.28s)]
*  want to present a narrative but it's a pretty astonishing narrative. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=82.16s)]
*  The idea that scores of drones were smuggled into Ukraine, loaded into pallets, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=86.56s)]
*  then put aboard trucks that were then driven possibly by unsuspecting drivers to these air bases [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  across the breadth of Russia where the drones were then launched remotely one by one [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=100.88s)]
*  and able to target those aircraft sitting on the tarmac. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=108.0s)]
*  This is an astonishing feat of intelligence and organisation which, as the Ukrainians have said, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=112.4s)]
*  has taken a long time to plan and execute and is clearly designed, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=120.8s)]
*  and would have been designed even a year and a half ago when they first came up with this idea, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=126.72s)]
*  to tell Russia and the world that Ukraine is not finished, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=130.88s)]
*  that it is not necessarily on the back foot, it may be losing territory inch by inch [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=135.76s)]
*  in the east of Ukraine, but that it is still capable of delivering heavy blows [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=141.04s)]
*  at the heart of Russia's military machine. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=146.95999999999998s)]
*  And a message not only to Russia, you say, to the rest of the world [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=150.16s)]
*  and importantly to the US as well ahead of these peace talks. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=154.32s)]
*  Yes, if people will remember the infamous encounter between President Zelensky and [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=160.32s)]
*  Donald Trump in the Oval Office earlier this year in which Donald Trump said to President Zelensky [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=165.2s)]
*  that he had no cards to play. Well, in the wake of what happened yesterday, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=171.2s)]
*  Ukrainians awash with internet memes showing President Zelensky dressed in a suit of cards [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=176.56s)]
*  or as the king of drones, as he's been dubbed in one social media post. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=184.0s)]
*  In other words, that the Ukrainians have become frustrated with the notion that somehow [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=191.36s)]
*  this is a country staring defeat in the face and willing to sue for peace at any price. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=199.04000000000002s)]
*  It is saying to Washington, no, that is not the case. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=205.44000000000003s)]
*  Do not work on the assumption that we are simply going to roll over and accept whatever peace you, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=208.72000000000003s)]
*  the United States, are able to extract from Russia. We have a say in this process too. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=214.88000000000002s)]
*  Let's bring in Hugo Bacheco who's live for us in Istanbul. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=220.72s)]
*  And Hugo, how are these strikes likely to impact this next round of peace talks there? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=224.64s)]
*  Well, I think it's very interesting because as Paul was saying, this sends a message not only [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=232.95999999999998s)]
*  to Russia but also to the US and other Western allies that Ukraine is still fighting, it hasn't [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=237.12s)]
*  been defeated and it is not going to be forced to accept major concessions to strike a deal. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=244.96s)]
*  I think here in Istanbul, few people are expecting a breakthrough because Russia and Ukraine remain [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=252.48000000000002s)]
*  far apart in these negotiations. Ukraine has demanded an unconditional ceasefire in these talks, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=258.32s)]
*  which has been rejected by Russia. And I think a lot of people are questioning Russia's real [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=263.92s)]
*  intentions here in these talks. The Ukrainians say that Russia is not really interested in [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=269.2s)]
*  pausing the conflict and ending the war. We've seen that in recent weeks Russia has actually [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=274.71999999999997s)]
*  intensified its air strikes on Ukraine. And Ukrainian officials also say that there have [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=280.8s)]
*  been indications that Russia is planning a summer offensive to try to seize even more [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=287.28s)]
*  Ukrainian territory. And they have been accusing President Putin of delaying tactics, of stalling [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=292.15999999999997s)]
*  for time in these negotiations, and of not really being interested in striking a deal. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=298.32s)]
*  And there may be a reason for that because both countries are under pressure from President Trump [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=302.96s)]
*  to reach a deal. The Ukrainians obviously need American military support, they want to stop the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=307.76s)]
*  violence in the country. And Russia is interested in the easing of economic sanctions. So that may [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=312.4s)]
*  be the reason why they are engaging in these negotiations. And many suspect they're not really [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=318.32s)]
*  interested in striking a deal here. Little hope of progress there in Istanbul, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=323.44s)]
*  Hugo. But do we know who's actually going to be in the room for these talks and what might be on [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=328.96s)]
*  the agenda? Yeah, so the Russian delegation is being led by a top Kremlin official and [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=334.64s)]
*  the Ukrainian team is being led by the Ukrainian defence minister. We haven't had the terms of [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=342.0s)]
*  the Russian demands made public. And we know that in recent weeks, Russian officials have [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=349.44s)]
*  continued to voice those demands that have already been rejected multiple times by the [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=357.35999999999996s)]
*  Ukrainians, such as a limit to the size of the Ukrainian military, also recognition of [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=362.88s)]
*  Ukrainian territory that has been seized by Russia, including Crimea. And the Ukrainians [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=369.03999999999996s)]
*  again are saying that they want a ceasefire now, unconditional ceasefire, before they can discuss [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=374.64s)]
*  terms of a long-term deal for this conflict, which again has been rejected by Russia. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpNwrpJVhSY&t=382.0s)]
