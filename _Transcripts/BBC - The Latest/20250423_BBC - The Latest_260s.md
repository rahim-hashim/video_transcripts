Video Description: A medieval cemetery unearthed near an airport in the UK has continued to raise questions for archaeologists, as the mystery surrounding it has multiplied.
 
The discovery of the site at Cardiff Airport dates to the 6th or 7th Century and was announced last year.
 
Dozens of skeletons were found lying in unusual positions with unexpected artefacts and now researchers have learned nearly all of those buried in the cemetery are women.
 
While their bones have shown signs of wear and tear, there are also surprising signs of wealth and luxury.

# Mystery of medieval cemetery near UK airport runway deepens | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [April 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U)
*  Archaeologists have been left baffled by a mysterious early medieval cemetery [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=0.0s)]
*  discovered close to Cardiff Airport. Some of the well-preserved skeletons have [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=5.96s)]
*  been found lying in unusual positions and unexpected artifacts are also causing [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=10.02s)]
*  confusion as our science editor Rebecca Morrell reports. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=15.32s)]
*  From beneath the ground a medieval mystery is slowly emerging. Located just outside of Cardiff, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=20.76s)]
*  a cemetery dating to the sixth or seventh century is being excavated. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=27.0s)]
*  Dozens of skeletons have been found but what archaeologists have unearthed has [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=31.12s)]
*  left them scratching their heads. Almost every skeleton unusually appears to be a [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=35.68s)]
*  woman suggesting this isn't an ordinary medieval community but that's not all. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  There are about 40 bodies buried in this half of the cemetery that's being [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=46.6s)]
*  excavated and each of their graves is dug out of a solid layer of limestone [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=51.72s)]
*  bedrock. Now most of the skeletons that have been found belong to adults but [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=57.76s)]
*  there are several children here and their burials are raising questions [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=62.44s)]
*  about this extraordinary cemetery. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=66.92s)]
*  Infant and child mortality was massively high during this period and there are [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=68.92s)]
*  only two children here. The earth that's been used to backfill the grave [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=74.48s)]
*  looks slightly different to that with some of the adults. It's darker, seems [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=78.88000000000001s)]
*  more organic. Potentially some time had elapsed between the burial of the adults [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=83.28s)]
*  and the burial of these two children. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=87.72000000000001s)]
*  More mysteries? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=89.44000000000001s)]
*  More mysteries, yes. Archaeology often does ask more questions, raise more [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  questions than it answers. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=94.64000000000001s)]
*  The people here led hard lives. Their bones show signs of wear and tear but there are [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=96.28s)]
*  also signs of wealth and luxury amidst the graves. This wasn't just a place [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=101.44000000000001s)]
*  where the dead were buried, people also came here to feast and drink with [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=105.76s)]
*  delicate pottery and finely decorated glass. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=109.72s)]
*  Glass is rare and where it is found these are sites of quite significant status. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=112.72s)]
*  The glass was probably made in the Levant, probably sort of Egypt area and [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=117.72s)]
*  then was manufactured into vessels we think in southern France and probably [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=124.88s)]
*  arrived here alongside wine in barrels. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=130.28s)]
*  Each person here seems to have been buried with great respect and care, apart [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=133.84s)]
*  from one found in a ditch at the edge of the site, tossed in without any [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=139.48s)]
*  ceremony. The bones have been brought to the lab at Cardiff University. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=144.4s)]
*  This person is an adult, all of their bones are fused, all of their teeth are [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=148.4s)]
*  erupted and we're pretty sure that this person was female. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=153.56s)]
*  And what sort of age would she have been do you think? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=157.4s)]
*  Maybe late 30s, early 40s. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=160.52s)]
*  The team don't know why she was treated so differently, perhaps she was an [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=163.52s)]
*  outcast or even a criminal but they're trying to find out as much as they can [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=168.52s)]
*  and the skeleton's teeth can provide vital clues. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=173.52s)]
*  A single tooth contains a whole life history from about the age of two right [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=176.52s)]
*  through to death, revealing everything from signs of poor health to what [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=181.52s)]
*  people ate at different times of their life and even where they came from. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  They've been eating a very consistent diet based on lots of carbs, not a lot [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=191.64000000000001s)]
*  of meat and that's true from their childhood into their adulthood and [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=196.64000000000001s)]
*  that's something we're seeing across the population. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  And any fish? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=202.64000000000001s)]
*  No fish whatsoever. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  As soon as the Romans leave we see an absence of fish signals in the diet. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=205.64000000000001s)]
*  It's one of the big mysteries. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  So who were these people? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=212.76s)]
*  Tests on ten of the skeletons show they came from different parts of Wales [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=214.76s)]
*  and possibly the south west of England too, but there's still much more to find out. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=218.76s)]
*  We're hoping to tell the story of the sort of individuals within the cemetery [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=223.76s)]
*  but also the kind of broader community. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=227.76s)]
*  We know a lot about the lives of kings and queens but much less about kind of [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=230.76s)]
*  everyday people and never before really have we been able to explore a single [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=235.76s)]
*  community in so much detail. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=241.88s)]
*  Only half of this cemetery has been uncovered so far. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=244.88s)]
*  More will be excavated over the summer. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=247.88s)]
*  But looking at what's been found already, archaeologists say they're expecting [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=249.88s)]
*  more surprises from this remarkable place. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C1qO0Ot70U&t=253.88s)]
