# Nightclub fire in North Macedonia leaves at least 51 dead | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI)
*  At least 51 people are thought to have been killed in a fire in a nightclub in North Macedonia. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI&t=0.0s)]
*  Many more have been injured in the blaze in the town of Kocani, around 100 kilometres east of the capital Skopje. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI&t=6.16s)]
*  The Macedonian state news agency says a band performing at the club was using fireworks, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI&t=13.44s)]
*  which is thought to be what led to the blaze. They say the fire then spread to the ceiling [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI&t=19.04s)]
*  and the roof of the building. More than a thousand people are believed to have been inside the venue [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI&t=23.92s)]
*  at the time. Let's talk to our Balkans correspondent, Guy Delauney. Guy, just tell us what you know about the latest here. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI&t=29.759999999999998s)]
*  So the band DNK were performing at the Pulse nightclub in Kocani and as you say that attracted [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI&t=39.12s)]
*  a really big crowd. Some reports saying around 1,500 people were inside the club at the time [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI&t=45.12s)]
*  and there's been footage posted on social media and on the Macedonian news sites [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  about what's been happening inside the nightclub. You can see the footage of flames spreading across [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI&t=56.96s)]
*  the ceiling. People, quite possibly staff at the nightclub, attempting to put out those flames [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI&t=62.72s)]
*  with fire extinguishers and then you get shots from outside the nightclub and you can see that [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI&t=68.56s)]
*  the entire building is entirely engulfed with flames and you can hear the sound of the flames [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI&t=73.28s)]
*  and the building burning as well in those videos. It's quite a horrendous sight and in terms of the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI&t=79.6s)]
*  number of injuries, the initial reports coming in from Kocani were that they had admitted 90 people [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI&t=84.16s)]
*  to the local hospital but they've since been transferring people to the capital Skopje because [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  there's a number of severe burns as you can imagine and the people have been injured. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI&t=94.0s)]
*  I do. It's the most unimaginable awful thing to happen on a night that was supposed to be [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI&t=98.24s)]
*  a fun night out. Guy, what are police saying about what they're doing? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI&t=103.19999999999999s)]
*  My police are saying that they are going to arrest and question everybody who's got anything to do [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI&t=107.28s)]
*  with the organisation of the event. Now, DNK were doing a short tour around venues in Macedonia. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI&t=112.56s)]
*  They're a well-known duo in Macedonia. Very much party music sort of thing you'd want to go to for [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  a night out if you're on for that in Macedonia. They were hitting the stage at midnight in the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  Pulse nightclub according to their own tour information but police will be wanting to interview [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI&t=130.64s)]
*  anybody to do with the band, anybody to do with the venue, anybody who has had anything to do with [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI&t=138.23999999999998s)]
*  I guess the inspection of the venue and its rating for safety. It's not very usual to hear about these [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI&t=142.48s)]
*  sorts of incidents at nightlife venues in North Macedonia. This is truly horrendous and it'll be [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI&t=149.6s)]
*  awfully shocking for people in that country. And it just seems to have spread so quickly, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI&t=155.44s)]
*  Guy. We hear that there was footage of sparks on the stage and those sparks [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI&t=160.8s)]
*  turned into a fire which got hold of the nightclub so quickly. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI&t=167.44s)]
*  Yes, and you can see the people who are at the venue, the customers, the people who have come to [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI&t=173.28s)]
*  hear the band. You can see that initially there doesn't seem to be any panic. People aren't [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI&t=178.72s)]
*  pushing for the exits in the footage that I've seen. There are announcements being made over [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI&t=183.76s)]
*  the loudspeakers, people are working with fire extinguishers, you can see sort of the flames [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI&t=188.64s)]
*  going across the ceiling but at that point there didn't seem to be any panics as things seem to [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  have deteriorated extremely quickly and that could explain the large numbers of people who've been [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI&t=198.16s)]
*  injured and from the reports that we're getting dozens of people killed. Guy, obviously the news [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI&t=203.76s)]
*  of this is just beginning to spread and sink in. Have there been reactions from senior politicians [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI&t=209.84s)]
*  and other figures? Well we know that Prime Minister Christian Mickowski is heading to [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI&t=216.16s)]
*  Kotzeny. Other government ministers are going to be there. I haven't heard any comments from them [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI&t=222.96s)]
*  yet but this is a real test of their leadership. North Macedonia is a young country, it's got [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI&t=228.16s)]
*  quite a lot of political divisions in it. At this sort of time, political leaders need to step up [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI&t=234.8s)]
*  and provide reassurance and answers for people who'll be suffering anguish at this time. Okay, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI&t=240.16s)]
*  Guy, thank you very much. Guy Delaney bringing us the latest on that disaster in the nightclub in [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI&t=245.6s)]
*  North Macedonia. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2ZsgtAMLI&t=250.56s)]
