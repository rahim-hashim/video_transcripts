Video Description: Germany has backed Ukrainian military strikes into Russian territory, after a weekend which saw Russia fire the highest number of drones and missiles into Ukraine since the war began.
 
Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that his backing would help Ukraine’s war effort, and it brings Germany alongside allies in the UK, France, and the US, who have previously removed all range limits on supplied arms.
 
At least 13 people were killed and dozens injured in Ukraine during the weekend attack in which 367 drones and missiles were used.

*  It comes as Germany says Kyiv is now free to use Western-supplied weapons [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3zoOL0Ku3Q&t=4.64s)]
*  to hit military targets deep inside Russia. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3zoOL0Ku3Q&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  Britain and the US lifted range restrictions on the weapons they supplied to Kyiv last year. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3zoOL0Ku3Q&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  The German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the move would help Ukraine to fight the war. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3zoOL0Ku3Q&t=17.04s)]
*  The comments from Germany follow a blistering series of attacks on Ukraine over the weekend, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3zoOL0Ku3Q&t=21.76s)]
*  in which Russia launched hundreds of drones along with at least nine cruise missiles. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3zoOL0Ku3Q&t=26.64s)]
*  Officials in Moscow suggested President Trump is, quote, emotionally overloaded [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3zoOL0Ku3Q&t=31.76s)]
*  after the US President said Vladimir Putin had gone absolutely crazy by escalating air strikes on Ukraine. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3zoOL0Ku3Q&t=36.4s)]
*  A little earlier I heard from Victoria Doriychenko, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3zoOL0Ku3Q&t=43.36s)]
*  program leader of the Future for Ukraine project at Cambridge University, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3zoOL0Ku3Q&t=46.64s)]
*  to get her response to the German Chancellor's comments [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3zoOL0Ku3Q&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  and what difference she thinks it will make to the Ukrainian war effort. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3zoOL0Ku3Q&t=53.28s)]
*  The German Chancellor just reinforced the words not only of Kirsten Starmann, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3zoOL0Ku3Q&t=56.72s)]
*  but also of President Macron and, of course, the position of the United States [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3zoOL0Ku3Q&t=61.04s)]
*  on having no longer any restrictions to have this long-range missile attacks and basically [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3zoOL0Ku3Q&t=65.36s)]
*  attacks is happening. Because to be precisely what you said, it's not only more than 300 [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3zoOL0Ku3Q&t=71.6s)]
*  shahats, it's actually 900 shahats in the last three days that were launched on civilians. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3zoOL0Ku3Q&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  To be precisely, not only on Kiev capital, where basically there were a combination of attacks [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3zoOL0Ku3Q&t=83.04s)]
*  with missiles, but also many other major cities. Basically, there was actually the celebrations of [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3zoOL0Ku3Q&t=88.0s)]
*  Kiev, what we say birthdays, when anniversary of the city comes. What does it make and what [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3zoOL0Ku3Q&t=94.56s)]
*  it means for Ukrainians? For most of all, it's not only to target the Russian civilians, but [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3zoOL0Ku3Q&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  actually to target the depots of where the most, what we said, of the weapon and the strikes where [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3zoOL0Ku3Q&t=105.36000000000001s)]
*  the Russian troops are launching. That will be definitely the game changer. Of course, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3zoOL0Ku3Q&t=111.68s)]
*  if the United States President Donald Trump's words are going to be true, of course, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3zoOL0Ku3Q&t=116.72000000000001s)]
*  Ukraine would love to see those sanctions to be in action. Because it was promised already since [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3zoOL0Ku3Q&t=121.2s)]
*  May 12 when no ceasefire from the Russian troops and Russian position was re-informed. Therefore, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3zoOL0Ku3Q&t=126.48s)]
*  sanctions didn't happen that time. We hope they're going to be happening at the beginning of June, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3zoOL0Ku3Q&t=134.4s)]
*  if supposedly, understandably, when the Congress is going to be out of its holidays and can vote [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3zoOL0Ku3Q&t=139.76s)]
*  for such sanctions, led by Lindsey Graham to be in action. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3zoOL0Ku3Q&t=146.88s)]
*  You mentioned President Trump then. Do you think there's anything significant about the change in [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3zoOL0Ku3Q&t=151.76s)]
*  his rhetoric regarding Mr Putin? Well, that's the point, because Donald Trump is zigzagging. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3zoOL0Ku3Q&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  Sometimes he's saying one thing and then reinforcing it from different actions. Sometimes it's a reverse [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3zoOL0Ku3Q&t=163.04s)]
*  thing. So now, finally, when he says that he is disappointed with the position of Kremlin leader, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3zoOL0Ku3Q&t=168.72s)]
*  it's not something new for Ukrainians and it's not something new for the European leaders itself. But [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3zoOL0Ku3Q&t=176.0s)]
*  being disappointed and making it in a real, let's say, actions, there are two different [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3zoOL0Ku3Q&t=181.52s)]
*  things. And we hope we can see these words being linked to actions. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3zoOL0Ku3Q&t=186.16s)]
