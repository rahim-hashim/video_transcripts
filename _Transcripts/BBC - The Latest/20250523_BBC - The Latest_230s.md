Video Description: The moment that Oceangate's Titan submersible was lost has been revealed in footage recorded on the sub's support ship.
 
Titan imploded about 90 minutes into a descent to see the wreck of the Titanic in June 2023, killing all five people on board.
 
The BBC has had unprecedented access to the US Coast Guard's (USCG) investigation for a documentary, Implosion: The Titanic Sub Disaster.
 
The footage was recently obtained by the USCG and shows Wendy Rush, the wife of Oceangate CEO Stockton Rush, hearing the sound of the implosion while watching on from the sub's support ship and asking: "What was that bang?"
 
Stockton Rush was on board the Titan sub, along with British explorer Hamish Harding, veteran French diver Paul Henri Nargeolet, the British-Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood and his 19-year-old son Suleman.

# Titan submersible footage captures moment of implosion | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc)
*  New evidence has been obtained by the US Coast Guard investigating the Titan submersible disaster in June 2023. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=0.0s)]
*  It captures the sound at the very moment the vessel imploded, 1000 metres below the surface. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=7.0s)]
*  It was on its way to view the wreck of the Titanic. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=12.0s)]
*  Well now a BBC documentary team has been given unprecedented access to the investigation. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=15.0s)]
*  Our science editor Rebecca Morell has more on that. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=21.0s)]
*  It was a trip that turned to tragedy. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=26.0s)]
*  A submersible heading to the Titanic, 3800 metres down. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=29.0s)]
*  But OceanGate's Titan sub suffered a catastrophic failure, killing all five people on board. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=35.0s)]
*  They were British explorer Hamish Harding, Suleiman Dawood and his father, British-Pakistani businessman Shazada Dawood, French diver P.H. Nagele and Stockton Rush, OceanGate's CEO. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=42.0s)]
*  The US Coast Guard's Marine Board of Investigation is looking into the disaster. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=54.0s)]
*  Footage they recently discovered from Titan's support ship has been submitted as evidence for their investigation. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=58.0s)]
*  You will hear a noise that is external to the ship, or external to the room I should say, and you will see their reaction to the noise. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=64.0s)]
*  Stockton Rush's wife Wendy is waiting for messages from the sub as it nears the sea floor. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=72.0s)]
*  What was that bang? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=84.0s)]
*  So at that point you said what was that bang? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=85.0s)]
*  What was that bang? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=87.0s)]
*  I'm going to back up and play it one more time. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=88.0s)]
*  It sounds like a door slamming. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=90.0s)]
*  Oh, I'm going to... [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=92.0s)]
*  What was that bang? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=97.0s)]
*  The noise is a sound of Titan imploding, but moments later Wendy Rush gets a message from the sub. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=99.0s)]
*  Drop two weights. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=105.0s)]
*  Titan drop two weights. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=110.0s)]
*  She mistakenly seems to think everything's OK, but in fact it's taken longer for the message to arrive than the sound of the implosion. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=112.0s)]
*  Everyone on board is dead. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=120.0s)]
*  The US Coast Guard says it has also now identified the moment the sub started to fail. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=124.0s)]
*  This is a full-scale model of the Titan submersible. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=129.0s)]
*  At the front there's a titanium dome with a viewport. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=133.0s)]
*  And at the rear is another dome covered by a tail cone. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=136.0s)]
*  The passengers were in this middle section, the hull. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=140.0s)]
*  It's made from carbon fibre, a material that's highly unpredictable at depth. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=144.0s)]
*  The hull is five inches, 13 centimetres thick, and it's made up of multiple layers. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=148.0s)]
*  But these layers can come apart, a known problem called delamination. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=154.0s)]
*  The sub was fitted with multiple sensors, and in 2022 during Titan's 80th dive they picked up a loud bang. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=160.0s)]
*  Stockton Rush said the noise was probably the sub shifting in its frame. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=168.0s)]
*  But analysis of the data now shows this was the layers of carbon fibre breaking apart. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=172.0s)]
*  Every dive after this one was a disaster waiting to happen. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=178.0s)]
*  Their system said there has been a fundamental change in the material of your carbon fibre, and it was no longer structurally sound. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=183.0s)]
*  Delamination at DIVADE was the beginning of the end. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=190.0s)]
*  And everyone that stepped on board the Titan after DIVADE was risking their life. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=194.0s)]
*  Ocean Gate have told the BBC, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=199.0s)]
*  We again offer our deepest condolences to the families of those who died. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=201.0s)]
*  Ocean Gate permanently wound down its operations and focused its resources on fully cooperating with the investigations being conducted. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=205.0s)]
*  They said it would be inappropriate to respond further while we await the agency's reports. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=213.0s)]
*  The disaster happened in a split second, but the ramifications continue. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=219.0s)]
*  The US Coast Guard will publish their full report in the coming months. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq8TCFGaOlc&t=223.0s)]
