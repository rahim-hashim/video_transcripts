Video Description: The CIA director has backed US President Donald Trump's view that the US strikes on Iran's nuclear sites caused severe damage.
John Ratcliffe said his agency has new intelligence that "several key Iranian nuclear facilities were destroyed”.
The Trump administration had been pushing back against a leaked intelligence assessment that suggested US attacks had only set back Iran's plans by “a few months”.
Meanwhile, the ceasefire between Israel and Iran seems to be holding and Trump said he doesn't think "they'll be going back at each other”.

# Intelligence indicates Iran nuclear programme 'severely damaged’, says CIA | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI)
*  The United States top intelligence official, the CIA director John Radcliffe, says new [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=0.0s)]
*  intelligence suggests that the American strikes on the Iranian nuclear sites had left them [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  severely damaged and that Iran's nuclear programme could take years to rebuild. Several officials [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=11.74s)]
*  within the Trump administration, including the President himself, have insisted that [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=20.32s)]
*  the sites were, in his words, totally obliterated. Meanwhile, an Israeli assessment says that [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=24.56s)]
*  the US strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, combined with its own attacks, have set back [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=31.68s)]
*  Iran's ability to develop nuclear weapons by years. It comes off the back of a leaked [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=36.56s)]
*  Pentagon assessment suggesting Iran's programme had probably only been set back by a few months [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=42.8s)]
*  rather than years. Well, the US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, criticised those American media [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=49.08s)]
*  outlets for carrying that initial assessment by the Pentagon intelligence agency, saying [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=56.199999999999996s)]
*  that it was preliminary. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=62.48s)]
*  So what do leakers do? They have agendas. And what do they do? Do they share the whole [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=64.48s)]
*  information or just the part that they want to introduce? And when they introduce that [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=69.22s)]
*  preliminary, a preliminary report that's deemed to be a low assessment, you know what [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=73.52s)]
*  a low assessment means? Low confidence in the data in that report. And why is there [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=80.75999999999999s)]
*  low confidence? Because all of the evidence of what was just bombed by 12, 30,000 pound [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=85.24s)]
*  bombs is buried under a mountain, devastated and obliterated. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=91.84s)]
*  A bullish Pete Hegseth there. Well, let's bring in my colleague Dan Johnson, who is [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=97.92s)]
*  live with us from our Jerusalem bureau. Dan, while the row goes on about the extent of [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=102.0s)]
*  the American damage on Iran's nuclear sites, Donald Trump has also weighed in on Benjamin [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=108.56s)]
*  Netanyahu's political and indeed legal woes at the moment. Tell us more. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=114.0s)]
*  Yes, this is a posting by the US president on his Truth Social Network. He's written [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=119.0s)]
*  a huge long post, quite extraordinary, writing there his support for Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=126.72s)]
*  Donald Trump said that Netanyahu was a great wartime prime minister, a warrior who was [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=132.4s)]
*  facing a ridiculous witch hunt. He said they'd been through hell together and that Netanyahu [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=137.0s)]
*  could not have been better, sharper or stronger. The US president again talked about the elimination [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=141.68s)]
*  of Iran's nuclear weapons and said that they'd been fighting for the survival of Israel. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=146.72s)]
*  He said that he just found out Netanyahu would be summoned back to court next week. And that [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=151.88s)]
*  is the latest stage of a corruption trial that Benjamin Netanyahu has been facing, these [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=156.6s)]
*  allegations that he's been facing over the last few years. That case has been going through [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=162.04s)]
*  the courts in recent months. The prime minister's had to give evidence there. Donald Trump says [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=166.6s)]
*  that that is politically motivated, a horror show, which he says should be cancelled or [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=171.72s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu should be pardoned for. He's called it a travesty of justice and said [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=176.51999999999998s)]
*  that after saving Israel, the US would now do what it could to save Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=181.02s)]
*  And Dan, while the focus has been very much on Iran, of course, over the last two weeks, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=188.78s)]
*  it is, there are several other hot spots of hostility in the region, not least in the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=193.42000000000002s)]
*  West Bank, the occupied West Bank, where there has been renewed violence and indeed fatalities [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=198.14000000000001s)]
*  there. Give us the latest on that. Yes, all quiet overnight in terms of Israel, Iran, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=202.94s)]
*  that ceasefire does seem to be holding, but still there is loss of life in Gaza and also [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=210.44s)]
*  in the West Bank, something that hasn't had a lot of attention over recent weeks, but [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=214.74s)]
*  something that has been ramping up ever since the October the seventh attacks, Israeli settlers [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=219.07999999999998s)]
*  who are raiding Palestinian villages, setting fire to homes and cars. And this is what we [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=223.64s)]
*  saw last night, dozens of masked figures ransacking a village, a town just to the northeast of [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=228.44s)]
*  Ramallah in the occupied West Bank. They were carrying sticks, they were setting fire to [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=234.62s)]
*  vehicles and to Palestinian homes. The Israeli military says that soldiers were called to [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=238.6s)]
*  respond to a confrontation there, both sides throwing stones at each other. The Israeli [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=243.72s)]
*  military says its soldiers came under attack and that's why they opened fire. Three Palestinians [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=249.1s)]
*  were shot dead there, at least seven were injured. It's the sort of thing that we've [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=254.07999999999998s)]
*  seen repeatedly carried out by Israeli settlers and increasingly over the last few months. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=258.04s)]
*  A reminder that Palestinian lives are at risk in the West Bank as much as they are [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=264.0s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=267.64s)]
*  Dan Johnson in Jerusalem, thanks very much indeed. As Dan was saying, the ceasefire with [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=270.16s)]
*  Iran appears to be holding for now. Our chief international correspondent, Liz Doucette, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=274.6s)]
*  is in Tehran. She is being allowed to report from there on condition that her reports are [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=279.72s)]
*  not broadcast on the BBC's Persian service, which broadcasts to the people of Iran. This [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=284.86s)]
*  law is being applied by the Iranian authorities to all international media outlets in Iran. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=291.68s)]
*  She says that on the streets of Tehran there is a growing sense of returning to normality. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=298.16s)]
*  Enormous relief that the bombs have stopped falling. You can feel even hour by hour the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=305.44s)]
*  rhythms of this city returning, if we can say normal, but that's only on the surface. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=313.44s)]
*  Just a short time ago I saw a group of young Iranian men and women, all of them in their [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=318.76000000000005s)]
*  running gear. It's a beautiful summer's day here. Traffic is starting to return. The first [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=323.04s)]
*  international flights will happen today. The internet is restored so Iranians can use many [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=330.28000000000003s)]
*  social media apps. They are banned here at all times, so they use VPNs to get around [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=336.14000000000004s)]
*  them. So conversations are starting online, some for and some against the governments. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=341.6s)]
*  You can see on the streets of Tehran there are still cafes and shops and government [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=346.96s)]
*  offices which are still shut. So many people left this city when Israel started attacking [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=351.64s)]
*  and some of them haven't come back yet. They want to be sure that this ceasefire is going [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=358.44s)]
*  to hold. The officials here are maintaining a very defiant tone. The president, Masoud [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=364.46s)]
*  Peshishtian, had sent a message to the nation last night, hailing the resilience and the [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=372.12s)]
*  defiance. Last night we went to a concert in a landmark square here in the city, Asadi [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=377.24s)]
*  Square, Freedom Square. It's where Iranians often gather at defining moments in history [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=383.88s)]
*  and underneath this beautiful iconic shrine of the soaring white marble the Tehran Symphony [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=389.6s)]
*  Orchestra was playing. And Iranians came and talking to them, some supported the government, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=396.48s)]
*  some didn't support the government, but they were all there to listen to the patriotic [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=401.76s)]
*  songs and say, really worrying for this moment. The emotions are still raw, worried most of [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=405.8s)]
*  all about the future of their country. And yes, the conversations will start in public [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=412.52s)]
*  and private, but right now Iranians are just trying to come to terms with the enormity [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=419.08s)]
*  of what has been happening here. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqImGfPbfXI&t=423.6s)]
