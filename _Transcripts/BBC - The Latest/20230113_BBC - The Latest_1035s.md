Video Description: Members of Italy’s most powerful mafia are facing charges including murder, extortion and drug-trafficking, in a trial that began two years ago. 

In the biggest trial of its kind since the 1980s, more than 330 suspects in the 'Ndrangheta mafia group have been testifying and 70 of them have been convicted. 

The group, based in the southern region of Calabria, dominates the global cocaine market and has an estimated annual turnover of around $60bn (£49bn).

Nicola Gratteri, the prosecutor leading the country's fight against organised crime, said convicting the group would create “breathing space” for the community.

*  I often talk about death. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=0.0s)]
*  The words of the current are always the same. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=6.4s)]
*  Kill, kill, kill. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=8.68s)]
*  The Andrangheta, Italy's most powerful mafia, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=12.4s)]
*  has had a stranglehold on one of the country's poorest regions, Calabria. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=15.8s)]
*  This is not the Andrangheta's country. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=23.0s)]
*  This is the country of Matera. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=26.2s)]
*  It's grown to dominate global drug trafficking, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=29.2s)]
*  now one of the world's richest and most dangerous crime syndicates. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=32.2s)]
*  The group is now estimated to control up to 80% of Europe's cocaine trade. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=40.6s)]
*  For decades, one man has been waging war against the Andrangheta, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=52.8s)]
*  risking his life. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=57.2s)]
*  Now he's taking hundreds to trial, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=58.6s)]
*  inflicting the biggest blow on the group in its history. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=61.0s)]
*  There are thousands of people, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=65.2s)]
*  so I'm the last hope of change on this planet. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=66.60000000000001s)]
*  So I don't want to disappoint them. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=70.0s)]
*  It's perhaps Italy's most dangerous commute [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=81.80000000000001s)]
*  by Italy's most threatened target. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=84.80000000000001s)]
*  Nicola Gratteri has spent his career [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=88.4s)]
*  fighting the country's most powerful mafia, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=91.0s)]
*  the Andrangheta. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=93.6s)]
*  As we speed through its bastion, the southern region of Calabria, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=95.6s)]
*  his five-car escort follows his every move. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=99.39999999999999s)]
*  It's been an over-exposure, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=123.6s)]
*  until we reach this point of suffocating control. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=129.6s)]
*  There's no alternative given what happened 30 years ago, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=145.6s)]
*  when Sicilian prosecutors Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=148.6s)]
*  were blown up by bombs planted by its mafia Cosa Nostra. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=152.6s)]
*  Their murders were a defining moment in Italy's modern history. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=157.6s)]
*  Their heroism still revered today. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=161.2s)]
*  Gratteri has devoted, even sacrificed, his life to this struggle. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=183.6s)]
*  The man, for decades on the kill list of mobsters, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=188.6s)]
*  is hardened, but doesn't look back. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=191.6s)]
*  We drive across the lush tow of Italy, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=212.6s)]
*  stronghold of the Andrangheta since the 19th century, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=215.6s)]
*  its family clans controlling the mountain villages. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=219.6s)]
*  From there, they've spread tentacles [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=226.6s)]
*  and [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=228.6s)]
*  From there, they've spread terror through killings and kidnappings, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=240.74s)]
*  deadly massacres elsewhere in Europe, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=244.74s)]
*  traced to their rivalry in Calabria. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=246.74s)]
*  Today, their currency is cocaine, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=253.74s)]
*  smuggled through Gioia Tauro, Italy's busiest container port. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=255.74s)]
*  The Andrangheta helped build it, and funnel the drugs onwards east, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=259.74s)]
*  the mafia's annual income an estimated 60 billion dollars. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=264.74s)]
*  Cocaine seizures here have tripled in the past two years. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=270.74s)]
*  Military hardware bound for Russia was also intercepted. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=274.74s)]
*  A recent police operation, two years in the making, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=279.74s)]
*  swooped on port workers who were part of a massive Andrangheta smuggling ring. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=282.74s)]
*  35 were arrested and seven tons of cocaine seized, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=287.74s)]
*  with a street value of 1.4 billion euros. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=291.74s)]
*  Around one in ten of the containers that pass through this port are checked. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=295.74s)]
*  This shipment seems to be clean, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=299.74s)]
*  but bananas from South America are a classic method [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=301.74s)]
*  that the Andrangheta use to stash cocaine. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=305.74s)]
*  Their branches operate right around the world, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=308.74s)]
*  and the group is now estimated to control up to 80% of Europe's cocaine trade. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=312.74s)]
*  The police are extremely strong. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=325.74s)]
*  They respond to us one by one. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=328.74s)]
*  We must never underestimate the police. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=330.74s)]
*  The activities we have carried out in the last two years, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=333.74s)]
*  especially the arrests of the last month, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=337.74s)]
*  have shown that the Italian state, the Italian judiciary, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=340.74s)]
*  the financial security and the other police forces [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=343.74s)]
*  do not give up a single centimeter [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=346.74s)]
*  and will certainly not give them the space to continue their illegal activities. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=349.74s)]
*  It's given extremely rare access to the bulk of the drugs that were captured. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=353.74s)]
*  And what is inside here? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=357.74s)]
*  This is our last seizure. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=359.74s)]
*  It was a seizure of four tons of cocaine. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=362.74s)]
*  So there's four tons of cocaine here? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=367.74s)]
*  Yes. The world's safe value is about 800 million euros. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=369.74s)]
*  The powder is tested with kits that look like something from the pandemic, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=375.74s)]
*  now detecting crime, not Covid. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=379.74s)]
*  It's positive. Purity 98%. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=382.74s)]
*  In 2019, a crackdown. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=388.74s)]
*  Dawn raids in different countries netting more than 330 suspects, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=391.74s)]
*  decapitating the Mancuso clan, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=396.74s)]
*  one of the ruthless families making up the Interagita. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=399.74s)]
*  Italy's biggest anti-mafia trial since the 1980s, ongoing for the past two years, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=403.74s)]
*  is in a converted call center to cope with the size, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=408.74s)]
*  with over 600 lawyers and 900 witnesses. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=412.74s)]
*  Charges include murder, extortion and drug trafficking. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=416.74s)]
*  One of the 335 suspects is an ex-MP. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=420.74s)]
*  The giant court room and hundreds of defendants and lawyers [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=424.74s)]
*  is intended to prove to Italians that their state is strikingly Interagita. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=429.74s)]
*  But equally, it's only one albeit powerful clan on trial out of an estimated 150. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=433.74s)]
*  And while it shows that the Interagita isn't untouchable, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=439.74s)]
*  there's no sense here that this is the beginning of the end of the Calabrian mafia. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=443.74s)]
*  So for Nicola Gratteri, the work and the threat doesn't stop. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=450.74s)]
*  The mafia fighter is dogged, determined, but proud of this milestone. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=455.74s)]
*  It's an important trial because it's about the current situation of the Interagita. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=463.74s)]
*  And so it's about, as a head of the prosecution, as a contest, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=470.74s)]
*  the relations with politics, with the world of professions, with the economy. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=477.74s)]
*  The Interagita loses at least 70% of the province of Vibhorentza, of that territory. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=484.74s)]
*  With this trial? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=493.74s)]
*  With this trial, yes. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=494.74s)]
*  How is your life? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=495.74s)]
*  I don't have a life. I never live alone. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=497.74s)]
*  To enter a bar, to have a coffee, during the street, we have to argue, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=501.74s)]
*  then we stop, someone comes in, pays, then we go in to have coffee. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=507.74s)]
*  Or we have to argue where to stop to go to the bathroom. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=512.74s)]
*  I haven't been to the restaurant, I haven't been to the cinema for 25 or 30 years. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=516.74s)]
*  Is it worth it? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=522.74s)]
*  It's worth it if you believe it. I believe it. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=526.74s)]
*  I think I'm doing something important. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=529.74s)]
*  I think there are thousands of people who believe in me. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=532.74s)]
*  There are thousands of people for whom I am the last beach, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=535.74s)]
*  the last hope of change on this land. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=539.74s)]
*  And so I don't want to disappoint them. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=542.74s)]
*  Meters away from his grave lies the family tomb of his killers. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=570.74s)]
*  How many more generations will be soaked in Calabria's blood feuds? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=575.74s)]
*  As long as people's mentality doesn't change, it will never change. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=584.74s)]
*  We have to sow as Prosecutor Gratteri, as all prosecutors like him, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=597.74s)]
*  until we follow the footsteps of these people. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=606.74s)]
*  We stay there, locked up, with the drangheta here that commands. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=616.74s)]
*  I need support, to fight, to go first-line and shout in the country, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=623.74s)]
*  for the country's roads. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=632.74s)]
*  Here the drangheta has to go away. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=636.74s)]
*  This is not the country of the drangheta, of the dranghetaists. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=639.74s)]
*  This is the country of Matteo. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=644.74s)]
*  Tell me a little bit about how Matteo was. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=646.74s)]
*  It was the joy of living, Matteo. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=652.74s)]
*  He was an exceptional, educated boy. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=656.74s)]
*  He never answered a word in the opposite way. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=659.74s)]
*  I am proud and proud to have been Matteo's mother [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=663.74s)]
*  and to have had Matteo as my son. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=668.74s)]
*  Sometimes I ask God, where was he when Matteo died? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=671.74s)]
*  And Laura tells me that he carried him with her. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=677.74s)]
*  It's hard to explain. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=684.74s)]
*  We travelled to the city of Calabria, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=695.74s)]
*  to find that rare thing, an drangheta turncoat. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=699.74s)]
*  With the group founded on blood ties, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=705.74s)]
*  disloyalty means betraying your own family, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=707.74s)]
*  and few have dared to do so. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=711.74s)]
*  Luigi Bonaventura uses his name but hides his face [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=716.74s)]
*  so he won't be recognised by those he turned against 16 years ago. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=720.74s)]
*  He's been under police protection ever since. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=725.74s)]
*  Now testifying in the Mancuso trial, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=728.74s)]
*  he offers a glimpse into the dark world of mafia indoctrination. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=730.74s)]
*  It's difficult to be born into a drangheta family, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=735.74s)]
*  because drangheta is an ethnicity, a state, a tribe. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=737.74s)]
*  But if you are born, while that family is fighting wars, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=741.74s)]
*  you can only grow up with hatred and violence. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=746.74s)]
*  So the recurring words were always the same, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=750.74s)]
*  kill, kill, kill. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=752.74s)]
*  So I was raised by a child who was a soldier, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=754.74s)]
*  so I used very young weapons. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=758.74s)]
*  I was a dromian cell, a dromian killer. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=761.74s)]
*  I was involved in five murders, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=765.74s)]
*  three of which I participated in, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=768.74s)]
*  and two of which I was directly involved in. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=770.74s)]
*  How important do you think that the police are? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=774.74s)]
*  How important do you think this trial is [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=778.74s)]
*  for the fight against the indoctrination? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=781.74s)]
*  Why did you decide to become a TANCO, a collaborator? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=808.74s)]
*  Perhaps the only way Italy can prize itself [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=823.74s)]
*  from the grip of the drangheta [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=826.74s)]
*  is indeed for the next generation of drangheta. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=828.74s)]
*  But the most important thing is that the country [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=831.74s)]
*  from which the drangheta is held, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=834.74s)]
*  the country from which the drangheta is held, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=837.74s)]
*  is indeed for the next generation to choose a different path. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=840.74s)]
*  That is what's driving these students, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=847.74s)]
*  some from Calabria, others from the north, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=850.74s)]
*  planting and clearing land seized from the drangheta. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=853.74s)]
*  It's a project organised by the anti-mafia association Libera, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=857.74s)]
*  which is a major part of the crime. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=861.74s)]
*  Mafia is a big problem for this part of Italy, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=865.74s)]
*  but we know that these organisations are spread all over the world, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=868.74s)]
*  and so it's important to make people aware of this problem [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=873.74s)]
*  and also make people sure that this organisation can be defeated by the law. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=879.74s)]
*  We are the future, and it's fundamental that we have faith [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=891.74s)]
*  in the state and the government, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=899.74s)]
*  and not in the mafia and the illegality. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=902.74s)]
*  So what of the future for those trying to free this tormented land [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=910.74s)]
*  from the drangheta lurking around every corner? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=914.74s)]
*  The young and the seasoned fighter, tenacious, but often alone in his struggle. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=918.74s)]
*  Hero to many, enemy of some, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=924.74s)]
*  Nicola Gratteri escaped the mafia's clutches when he was a boy. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=927.74s)]
*  Can he get his country to do the same? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=931.74s)]
*  I've done some investigations and arrested some of them for weapons and drugs. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=948.74s)]
*  Could Italy ever free itself from the mafia? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=953.74s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=958.74s)]
*  It can be greatly reduced, changing the rules of the game, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=960.74s)]
*  but to fight the mafia, we need a revolution. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=965.74s)]
*  We need a stronger system and, above all, to invest in education. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=970.74s)]
*  Who is winning the battle? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=975.74s)]
*  We are competing. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=979.74s)]
*  Do you have any regrets? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=982.74s)]
*  Everything in life has a price. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=984.74s)]
*  To have a normal life, I had to go slower. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=987.74s)]
*  I had to try harder, but I would have felt a little bit of a pain. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=991.74s)]
*  And for me, living as a villager has no meaning. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23sY_KRloI4&t=996.74s)]
