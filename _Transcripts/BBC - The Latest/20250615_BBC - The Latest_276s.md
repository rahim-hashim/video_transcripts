Video Description: Doctors in India say 270 bodies have been recovered from the site of Thursday's plane crash in Ahmedabad.
The London-bound aircraft crashed into a residential area shortly after take-off killing all but one of the 242 passengers and crew members, a 40-year-old British man.
Officials have also been trying to establish how many people were killed on the ground and have been continuing the slow process of matching DNA samples to confirm the victims' identities.
Vigils honouring the dead have taken place across India and the UK.
India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) is leading the inquiry into the cause of the crash, helped by teams from the US and UK.

# Air India plane crash death toll rises to 270 | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [June 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI)
*  To India now and authorities say they've now recovered 270 bodies from the site of the plane crash in Amnabad city on Thursday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=0.0s)]
*  241 people on board the flight died. One British passenger escaped through a hole in the fuselage. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=9.0s)]
*  Our correspondent Davina Gupta sent this report from the city. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=16.0s)]
*  An angry Ghulam Rasool demanding the body of his friend Javed at the city hospital in Ahmedabad. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=20.0s)]
*  This is an emergency case and the DNA report should come out quickly, but the authorities are not doing anything about it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=28.0s)]
*  Javed was among those killed when the London bound Air India flight crashed on Wednesday. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=36.0s)]
*  In another corner, more angry voices. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=42.0s)]
*  Give my son's body back, shouts one man. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=47.0s)]
*  The process is slow. Families first have to submit DNA samples for identification and then they're asked to go to the government mortuary. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=52.0s)]
*  Now there's a cold storage room inside where the bodies have been kept under freezing conditions till the time their family members can come forward and identify them. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=61.0s)]
*  Now they've been charged beyond recognition. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=72.0s)]
*  So just outside this place, there is a table where officials are sitting to confirm a DNA match. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=75.0s)]
*  Now these are the family members have already given their DNA samples in another hospital. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=82.0s)]
*  And once they have been matched, they've been called here to show their identification. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=87.0s)]
*  And after that, they've been allowed to go inside. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=92.0s)]
*  And by the evening, some answers begin to arrive. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=95.0s)]
*  Officials say they've had DNA matches for a total of 11 victims so far. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=100.0s)]
*  Among the first to be identified was a young medical student, Aryan Rajput. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=106.0s)]
*  His family took his body home to the central Indian city of Gwalior for a final farewell. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=112.0s)]
*  They're also seeking the truth behind this flight crash. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=120.0s)]
*  The government says it's speeding up the probe. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=126.0s)]
*  Back at Ahmedabad's hospital, empty coffins arrived to transport the last remains of the crash victims. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=147.0s)]
*  A grim reminder of the loss and the long wait for many families. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=154.0s)]
*  Divina Gupta, BBC News, Ahmedabad. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=159.0s)]
*  Let's go live to the scene and my colleague Arunade Mukherjee is there. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=163.0s)]
*  And Arunade, I understand some of the funerals are likely to take place today. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=167.0s)]
*  Well, yes, we're not exactly sure whether those are the bodies of those from the aircraft [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=175.0s)]
*  or the bodies that were recovered from the site of the people who were inside those buildings when the aircraft struck. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=180.0s)]
*  We do have an updated death toll from the Doctors Association of the hospital, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=188.0s)]
*  which is treating the injured as well as attending to the dead. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=195.0s)]
*  They said that 270 have died is the report that they have. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=198.0s)]
*  And at the moment, over here, we've seen since yesterday a steady stream of officials [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=202.0s)]
*  who continue to arrive driving in and out through these barricades. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=207.0s)]
*  This is the last point, as I've been saying, till the crash site where we've been barricaded into. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=210.0s)]
*  But the officials essentially coming in and out still, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=216.0s)]
*  the efforts are on to ensure that they've managed to pick up everything that could be essential and crucial to the investigation, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=219.0s)]
*  which they feel could perish in this heat and in this humidity. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=225.0s)]
*  It also rained a bit last night, so they're really working against time to ensure they have all the articles. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=229.0s)]
*  I have seen relatively less activity here compared to yesterday or till last evening. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=235.0s)]
*  It's been fairly quiet in relative terms, but you see the occasional cars coming in and out. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=242.0s)]
*  We heard from the Civil Aviation Minister as that reporter by my colleague Davina also pointed out yesterday, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=247.0s)]
*  and they're focusing on two major things. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=251.0s)]
*  One, of course, is the recovery of the black box, the successful recovery of the black box, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=254.0s)]
*  which they feel is going to give you all the details about what happened in the cockpit moments before the crash. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=257.0s)]
*  And two, the ongoing investigations of the existing 787 Boeing fleet, which is being carried out. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=263.0s)]
*  They've managed to clear a few aircraft, but many more are left. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=270.0s)]
*  Runa Day live there at the scene. Thank you very much. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWHsxUYkbI&t=273.0s)]
