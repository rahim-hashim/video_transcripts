# Nato leaders discuss defence spending at summit  | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZGmKC9rYZA)
*  Welcome back. In the past hour, NATO's foreign ministers have convened for a major meeting in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZGmKC9rYZA&t=0.0s)]
*  Brussels where the alliance is due to make a commitment to ramp up military spending. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZGmKC9rYZA&t=5.04s)]
*  By just how much, however, is still up for negotiation and it will dominate talks today. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZGmKC9rYZA&t=10.32s)]
*  NATO chief Mark Ross is optimistic that ministers will sign off on spending three and a half percent [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZGmKC9rYZA&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  of GDP on core military needs and 1.5 percent on related expenses such as infrastructure [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZGmKC9rYZA&t=21.28s)]
*  and cyber security by 2032. So what we will do today is to decide what do we need to make it [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZGmKC9rYZA&t=28.24s)]
*  for us to be able to whenever we would be attacked to defend ourselves and by being able to defend [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZGmKC9rYZA&t=38.48s)]
*  ourselves not being attacked. So as you know to prepare for war spend more and when you are [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZGmKC9rYZA&t=46.32s)]
*  really prepared for war you will not be attacked. That will be a considerable extra investment [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZGmKC9rYZA&t=53.92s)]
*  and this is why I predicted in the Hague we will decide on a much higher spending target for all [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZGmKC9rYZA&t=62.96s)]
*  the nations in NATO. Mark Rotter there well let's cross over to speak to Jonathan Beale our defence [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZGmKC9rYZA&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  correspondent joining us from Brussels and Jonathan arguably spending dominating today's agenda but [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZGmKC9rYZA&t=74.72s)]
*  when you have countries like Poland spending committing to 5 percent next year, Italy only [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZGmKC9rYZA&t=81.44s)]
*  just hitting 2 percent there is a lot to discuss. Clearly the pressure is on from the US because [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZGmKC9rYZA&t=86.8s)]
*  PTEK said they did not attend yesterday's coalition providing weapons to Ukraine the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZGmKC9rYZA&t=98.08s)]
*  meeting that was taking place here at NATO that was chaired by both Britain and Germany. He [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZGmKC9rYZA&t=104.8s)]
*  did not turn up for that but he has turned up for this meeting which is the defence minister's [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZGmKC9rYZA&t=110.08s)]
*  meeting the last big meeting before NATO summit in the Hague later this month with a clear message [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZGmKC9rYZA&t=114.16s)]
*  and that message from the US defence secretary is that you cannot just rely on America for your [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZGmKC9rYZA&t=120.56s)]
*  defences you are going to have to spend 5 percent of GDP on defence. Now that message does not [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZGmKC9rYZA&t=126.72s)]
*  is essentially to Europe it's not to America which spends 3.4 percent of its GDP on defence but that [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZGmKC9rYZA&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  is the deal that America wants at this summit and that is the deal that Mark Rotter has been working [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZGmKC9rYZA&t=140.96s)]
*  on behind the scenes and is discussing with NATO defence ministers. Essentially what they're meant [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZGmKC9rYZA&t=146.56s)]
*  to be discussing as defence ministers is capability in other words the hardware military hardware that [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZGmKC9rYZA&t=152.4s)]
*  they need to invest in and that's meant to drive the spending costs but really the person who set [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZGmKC9rYZA&t=158.16s)]
*  set the spending target is Donald Trump and the compromise that Mark Rotter, NATO secretary-general [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZGmKC9rYZA&t=163.84s)]
*  has come up with is this idea of spending 3.5 percent of GDP on military and then 1.5 on [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZGmKC9rYZA&t=168.96s)]
*  defence related expenditure. Now that could mean building roads, building bridges, building ports [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZGmKC9rYZA&t=177.68s)]
*  so it's a pretty vague description. There is still a wrangling going on about when so there is talk [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZGmKC9rYZA&t=182.72s)]
*  of a date of 2032 some countries saying it must be later 2035 some countries in the Baltic States [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZGmKC9rYZA&t=190.24s)]
*  suggesting it should be within five years so there are negotiations still ongoing and some countries [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZGmKC9rYZA&t=196.32s)]
*  are still not happy about that level of defence expenditure. One thing I would say is remember [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZGmKC9rYZA&t=201.92s)]
*  they set a target of 2 percent more than a decade ago and as you mentioned some countries have still [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZGmKC9rYZA&t=207.76s)]
*  not met that 2 percent target so it's well it's you know may be important to have a target the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZGmKC9rYZA&t=213.92s)]
*  fact is that they can't be forced to spend that level on defence spending it is a target it's not [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZGmKC9rYZA&t=219.76s)]
*  something that they can be punished for if they don't meet it. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZGmKC9rYZA&t=226.07999999999998s)]
