Video Description: The maker of a viral AI video that apparently depicted Donald Trump's vision for Gaza has spoken about the reaction to his video.
 
Creator Solo Avital called the video a "satire" and said it was posted by the US president without consent.
 
Trump shared it to his own social media platform, Truth Social, as well as his other social media accounts.
 
Last month, Trump proposed that the US would "own" Gaza and relocate its population, so that it could be rebuilt and turned into the "Riviera of the Middle East".

# Creator of AI Gaza video shared by Donald Trump says it was 'satire' | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU)
*  Well, you may remember that Gaza video of last week, which went viral after being reposted [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=0.0s)]
*  by Donald Trump. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=6.8s)]
*  I want to put it onto the screen because it's AI generated, that Gaza scene, apparently [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=8.16s)]
*  a vision of Donald Trump's plans to transform the Gaza Strip into the Riviera of the Middle [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=13.88s)]
*  East. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=19.32s)]
*  It depicts Elon Musk tucking into delicacies, Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu on a beach [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=20.32s)]
*  with a sort of Dubai-like backdrop. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=24.52s)]
*  It obviously at the time caused huge, huge offence, not just in the region. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=27.2s)]
*  Well, I've been speaking with the video's creator, Solo Avital, about why he chose to [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=32.64s)]
*  make the video. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=37.72s)]
*  Basically it was that the whole story is sort of like a comedy of coincidence, I would say, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=40.4s)]
*  because it was a day that Donald Trump announced his Gaza plant and our company, iMix Visuals [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  in Los Angeles. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=54.8s)]
*  We often test different AI platforms. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=56.36s)]
*  We generate films, commercials, and we just came across this amazing new technology by [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=60.12s)]
*  a company, another LA-based company called Arcana Labs. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=67.52s)]
*  They gave us sort of like an access to their latest AI model. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=71.56s)]
*  As we do often with testing stuff, we test the speed and quality and we figured, okay, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=77.8s)]
*  let's try to do something within our eight hours, one shift, kind of like one seat between [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=84.16000000000001s)]
*  two cups of coffee, if you may. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=88.68s)]
*  Just as it happened, my partner, Ariel Vroman, who is a filmmaker himself, was in Las Vegas. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=92.2s)]
*  As the news broke out, literally at the same time, he was just taking his phone, pointing [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=99.08000000000001s)]
*  it out to the Las Vegas strip and said, Las Vegas strip? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=102.68s)]
*  Gaza strip. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=107.24000000000001s)]
*  Las Vegas? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  It was that kind of like a comic moment in a way that was absurd. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=109.80000000000001s)]
*  That's how it started. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=114.24s)]
*  You say it took eight hours. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=115.24s)]
*  I read you said that it was basically the intention was a satire to underline the megalomaniac [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=116.36s)]
*  nature of the idea. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=123.2s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=125.04s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=126.04s)]
*  I mean, we basically, you know, when you have a test drive to do of a technology, you have [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=127.04s)]
*  a limited time, you don't really have time to really go into script and writing and developing [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=132.12s)]
*  a storyboard and all sorts of stuff. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=136.4s)]
*  We said, all right, that sounds like fun. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=138.92000000000002s)]
*  Let's just have a let's just play around with that idea. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=141.32s)]
*  And you know, the rest is history. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=145.07999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=146.72s)]
*  I mean, you say it was satire. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=147.72s)]
*  It obviously caused huge offense. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=149.23999999999998s)]
*  But the president, the president of the United States, reposted it. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=150.95999999999998s)]
*  Just give me a snapshot really briefly of the moment you found out that he'd done that. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=155.2s)]
*  Well, just a bit of a background before that. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=161.79999999999998s)]
*  He actually posted it a week after we created it literally. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=164.68s)]
*  And as we do with tests, we shared with friends and colleagues. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=169.32000000000002s)]
*  And the reaction was obviously everybody realized that it's a satire. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=173.0s)]
*  So they were laughing about it and sending us like, you know, kind of fun emojis. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=177.64000000000001s)]
*  And then Ariel, who's my partner, who has over one hundred and thirty thousand followers [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=184.04000000000002s)]
*  on Instagram, posted it. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=188.64000000000001s)]
*  And then it took me two hours to catch it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=191.0s)]
*  And seeing that he posted it, I called him and said, Ariel, please take it down. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=193.28000000000003s)]
*  We thought that we were going to get in trouble with the president. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=197.0s)]
*  That's what I thought. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=199.72s)]
*  You know, I thought we were going to get, you know, offend the White House or something. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=200.72s)]
*  So he took it down. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=205.28s)]
*  And but I think by that time, it was too late. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldq2Oj3tHWU&t=206.28s)]
