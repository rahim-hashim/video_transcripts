Video Description: US stock markets have fallen again as President Donald Trump prepares to unveil a massive slate of import taxes on Wednesday 2nd April, which he has called America's "Liberation Day”.
 
It comes after the US president suggested that new tariffs he is set to announce this week will hit all countries, not just those that have the biggest trade imbalances with the US.
 
London’s Downing Street says the UK "expects" to be affected by US tariffs and is not ruling out retaliatory tariffs in response.

# Donald Trump to unveil sweeping new tariffs on Wednesday | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [April 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU)
*  Well, the clock is ticking towards what President Trump has called America's Liberation Day. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=0.0s)]
*  He says he will unveil a massive slate of import taxes on all countries on Wednesday, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=4.32s)]
*  though he's also promised to be kind. Tariffs are taxes paid by U.S. importers on foreign [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  purchased goods. Details are still limited on the range of the tariffs. But there is growing unease [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  about what this tariff war will mean for the global economy. UK government has been trying [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=20.56s)]
*  to negotiate a last-minute trade deal to exempt British goods, but confirmed yesterday [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=25.12s)]
*  expects the UK will be hit when the import taxes are introduced. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=30.24s)]
*  President Trump has been speaking to the media in the Oval Office, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=34.88s)]
*  where he said he expects his tariffs to give the U.S. economy a major boost. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=37.44s)]
*  They speak now to Maria de Merzis, Chief Economist at the Conference Board of Europe. Maria, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=59.84s)]
*  good to have you with us. Just listening to President Trump there, I wonder if you agree, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=69.68s)]
*  if we could just look at the U.S. first. Do you think it's going to be a major boost [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=74.32000000000001s)]
*  to the U.S. economy, these tariffs? It's unlikely there will be a boost. I mean, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=78.08000000000001s)]
*  the first thing will be trade will necessarily reduce, and that will have an impact on the U.S. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=82.56s)]
*  economy. We've already seen revisions in growth downwards, upward revisions for inflation, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=88.16s)]
*  and of course the stock markets that are extremely volatile. Nothing of that is good for the U.S. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=93.2s)]
*  economy. But next to that, there's other measures that follow the tariffs, and that is corporate [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=97.92s)]
*  taxes reducing, trying to attract investments back to the U.S., either from American economies [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=103.12s)]
*  that operate elsewhere or from global economies. And actually, there is some evidence of that, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=109.12s)]
*  some companies might be coming back to the U.S. that will boost investment. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=115.04s)]
*  Whether the net effect is positive remains to be seen, but I am not hopeful. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=118.24s)]
*  Higher inflation, greater recession risks, that's what people are saying for the U.S. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  And obviously, there's going to be a knock-on effect for the global economy as well. Tell us [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=127.52s)]
*  what your thoughts are on what this could mean for the rest of the world. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=132.32s)]
*  Again, it will have global effects everywhere, especially for jurisdictions like the EU where I [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=136.32s)]
*  live, which is a big exporting region. We rely a lot on exports, and therefore exports to the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=141.04s)]
*  U.S. will necessarily suffer. The EU exports a lot to the U.S., both in goods and services. That, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=146.56s)]
*  of course, will take a hit. But I think global trade will take a hit. I think there will be a [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=152.23999999999998s)]
*  reduction in trade that we haven't seen in a long time, except the pandemic era. And on top of that, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=157.28s)]
*  of course, we are going to have a high increase in prices, and the consumer will see greater [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=163.68s)]
*  inflation on goods and services that they buy on a daily basis, and of course, much less choice. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=169.12s)]
*  The consumer will definitely worse off. Maria, what about the stock markets around the world? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=174.08s)]
*  Many are saying that the hit from the tariffs could still be coming. We haven't seen the worst of it [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=178.88s)]
*  yet. No, we haven't. Till we have some certainty in terms of what goes on in tariffs, there will be [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=183.84s)]
*  volatility. Now, it's interesting to say also that if we do have some certainty of what tariffs [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=190.16s)]
*  will be, that would be, of course, bad for the economy. But at least we have some certainty [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=195.6s)]
*  of what that is. And you see that we hear it from businesses that they want some certainty so that [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=198.72s)]
*  they can prepare. So some news, even if they are bad news, it's important to reduce that volatility. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=202.72s)]
*  And tell us a bit more about those US businesses that are starting to reassure in response to this [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=208.56s)]
*  threat of tariffs. We don't know yet what impact that will have. But how long does it normally take [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=214.96s)]
*  for a business to do that? It depends. Big manufacturers, of course, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  find it difficult to relocate unless they have already installations in the US. But we have heard [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=224.16s)]
*  from Nvidia, the big semiconductor company, that they will reassure, they will bring some of their [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  operations in China back into the US with huge investments for the next four years in the US, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=235.28s)]
*  which is effectively what President Trump wants. He wants manufacturing back in the US. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=240.4s)]
*  And we've also heard Apple relocating back, bringing some of the Asian production [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=245.2s)]
*  back to the US in fear of tariffs hitting their Chinese operations. So there is some movement, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=250.08s)]
*  which is also being helped by corporate taxation reducing, which is one of the big [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=256.16s)]
*  campaign points that President Trump used. So it's not just about tariffs. It's also about creating [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=261.84000000000003s)]
*  a much more friendly environment, conducive to businesses in the US. It's so interesting [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=266.64s)]
*  to get your thoughts, Maria. Thank you very much. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8oNU3ld4WU&t=270.96000000000004s)]
