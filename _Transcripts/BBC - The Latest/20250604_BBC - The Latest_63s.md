**BBC - The Latest:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUSutjNRHyI)
*  That baby's going to be mad at you because you named him a last name. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUSutjNRHyI&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, the name is originally spelled B-O-Y-A-N-C-E. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUSutjNRHyI&t=3.44s)]
*  And when my parents came to Texas, they had the spelling somehow of B-E-Y-I-N-C-E. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUSutjNRHyI&t=8.0s)]
*  And so I asked my mom and she said that whatever your birth certificate said in the hospital, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUSutjNRHyI&t=16.32s)]
*  that's what you went by. And I said, well, why didn't you make them change it? And she said, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUSutjNRHyI&t=22.56s)]
*  well, I did try once and the nurse told me, be happy that you got a birth certificate. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUSutjNRHyI&t=27.6s)]
*  One brother's name was B-U-Y-I-N-C-E and my name was B-E-Y-O-N-C-E, which is where Beyoncé's name [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUSutjNRHyI&t=33.2s)]
*  came from. So I thought it was a gift to my father to name her Beyoncé. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUSutjNRHyI&t=39.36s)]
*  Could you imagine what that word then became? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUSutjNRHyI&t=44.32s)]
*  And the fact that my dad did not get to see that and my mom didn't get to see their name [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUSutjNRHyI&t=47.68000000000001s)]
*  just everywhere, even though spelling is different. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUSutjNRHyI&t=53.279999999999994s)]
*  Yeah, who would have thought that that name would be a household word now? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUSutjNRHyI&t=57.44s)]
