**BBC - The Latest:** [July 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdhtEu_ccfU)
*  So we got to Camp Mystic, which is just across the river from here, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdhtEu_ccfU&t=0.0s)]
*  and you can see the recreation hall where the water tore away one of the walls. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdhtEu_ccfU&t=3.72s)]
*  There's still quite a lot of rescue workers over there sifting through the debris. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdhtEu_ccfU&t=9.32s)]
*  Still some of those girls missing, of course, but really hope for them is diminishing. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdhtEu_ccfU&t=14.64s)]
*  And as we drove along the road to get here, there was huge amounts of devastation. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdhtEu_ccfU&t=18.72s)]
*  Houses had been demolished. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdhtEu_ccfU&t=24.88s)]
*  There was a mattress in a tree that we saw, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdhtEu_ccfU&t=27.44s)]
*  US flag still standing in someone's front yard when everything else had pretty much been destroyed. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdhtEu_ccfU&t=30.8s)]
*  Utility workers are trying to sort out downed power lines, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdhtEu_ccfU&t=36.92s)]
*  and the diggers are being brought into to shift debris as well. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdhtEu_ccfU&t=41.04s)]
*  This is a huge cleanup operation that they're trying to invoke here. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdhtEu_ccfU&t=44.64s)]
