# Romanian election: Liberal, pro-EU mayor Nicusor Dan wins tense race for presidency | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E)
*  A liberal politician who favours closer ties with the European Union has won Romania's presidential election. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=0.0s)]
*  Nicolchor Dan has an unassailable lead over the nationalist candidate George Simien. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=6.5s)]
*  In a victory speech, Dan told supporters the process of rebuilding the country would start tomorrow. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=11.5s)]
*  Let's speak to our Eastern Europe correspondent Sarah Rainsford who's in Bucharest. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=18.0s)]
*  Hi Sarah, so just talk us through the story of the night. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=22.5s)]
*  We were on the streets last night here in central Bucharest and there was a really big crowd that had come to the headquarters of Nicolchor Dan. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=26.0s)]
*  He's the mayor of Bucharest but he's the man who has just won the presidential election here. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=34.0s)]
*  It was an extremely tense few months because if you remember back in November the elections were run for president but they were then cancelled [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=40.0s)]
*  because the man who won, a man called Carlin Jorgescu in the first round, it was found that there was evidence of Russian interference in the vote. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=47.0s)]
*  So the whole thing was cancelled and six months later it was run again. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=54.0s)]
*  And last night when Nicolchor Dan announced his victory, amongst the chants of people cheering his name, people screaming with excitement, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=58.0s)]
*  there were also chants saying Russia, don't forget, Romania is not yours. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=67.0s)]
*  So in many senses this was a vote against Russia meddling. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=73.0s)]
*  It was a vote from Romanians saying this is their country, they'll decide their future. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=76.0s)]
*  But over in the other camp, if you like, the camp of George Simeon, the other candidate who came second, there was also frustration there. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=80.0s)]
*  People couldn't quite believe that this was not the result they'd wanted. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=89.0s)]
*  This had been a very tight race. They had expected to win it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=94.0s)]
*  But in the end, although George Simeon came out and announced himself to be president, the results did not show that. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=97.0s)]
*  The exit poll was giving 54% to Nicolchor Dan, the man who eventually won it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=103.0s)]
*  In the end, that was pretty much the final result. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=108.0s)]
*  54% to Nicolchor Dan, 46% to the hard-right nationalist candidate who has now lost this election. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=111.0s)]
*  And so what does this mean for the country now? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=118.0s)]
*  Well, it means that they have stepped away from the brink, if you like, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=124.0s)]
*  of voting for a man who was very much a Euro skeptic, who is a hard-line nationalist, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=128.0s)]
*  a man who has said very negative and insulting things about many people here in Romania and domestic politics, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=135.0s)]
*  but also just this week described Emmanuel Macron of France as a man with dictatorial tendencies. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=141.0s)]
*  I think if he had been president, you can see the kind of relationship, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=147.0s)]
*  the kind of change in tone in relations between Romania and other members of the EU. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=150.0s)]
*  I think that's one thing many people here were worried about. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=156.0s)]
*  I think in terms of relations with Ukraine, things will now stay the same. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=160.0s)]
*  The candidate, the nationalist candidate, had said he would stop military aid to Ukraine. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=165.0s)]
*  There was a lot of talk about the need to push for peace for Ukraine, which is essentially what Vladimir Putin says. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=170.0s)]
*  So that has changed, that will stay the same. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=175.0s)]
*  Romania will remain a key ally of Ukraine, which is on its border. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=178.0s)]
*  There is quite a lot of concern here about the war in Ukraine. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=183.0s)]
*  Lots of people have been focused on that in the run-up to this election, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=185.0s)]
*  people talking about the danger of the war spilling over into Romania. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=188.0s)]
*  And that was kind of a key thing in people's minds as they went to vote. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=192.0s)]
*  But ultimately they voted for the candidate who will maintain the status quo, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=196.0s)]
*  which is strong support for Ukraine, including military aid, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=199.0s)]
*  and also helping Ukraine with its grain exports to Europe. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=202.0s)]
*  So in that sense, this vote was particularly important. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=205.0s)]
*  Sarah, thank you for that. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=208.0s)]
*  We'll speak now to Andrei Popovic, journalist in Bucharest. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=209.0s)]
*  Thanks for coming on the programme. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=213.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=215.0s)]
*  So are you surprised by the results? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=216.0s)]
*  I think it started to be clearer and clearer as we were nearing the second round of the vote, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=219.0s)]
*  that Nicos Chordan has real chances to win. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=225.0s)]
*  Let's remember after the first round, there was a huge difference between the two candidates. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=230.0s)]
*  Nicos Chordan had 21%, while Simeone had 41%. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=235.0s)]
*  And then the polls were putting them at about 10% difference. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=239.0s)]
*  And that difference shrunk as we were nearing the second round, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=242.0s)]
*  mainly due to a huge mobilisation of voters in Romania and abroad. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=247.0s)]
*  But also because a lot of mistakes that Mr Simeone has made [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=256.0s)]
*  that I think has really made voters, even those who voted for him maybe before, change their minds. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=261.0s)]
*  So what were those kind of mistakes? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=267.0s)]
*  Because he was in that commanding position. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=269.0s)]
*  What in your eyes were the mistakes tactically that he made? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=271.0s)]
*  I think Simeone ran a campaign that was focused on attacking his opponent. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=275.0s)]
*  He was very confident at the beginning of the first round. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=281.0s)]
*  And even before it, he never went into a debate before the first round. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=285.0s)]
*  He went to one after he got through to the second round with Nicos Chordan. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=292.0s)]
*  And that debate was largely seen as a positive instance in which Nicos Chordan was catching up [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=298.0s)]
*  and managed to hold his ground in front of Simeone. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=306.0s)]
*  After that, he didn't show up to other four debates. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=310.0s)]
*  He stopped doing interviews with the media and he started attacking his candidate. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=313.0s)]
*  Amongst these were personal attacks. He called him an autistic guy. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=319.0s)]
*  There were a lot of very dirty and personal attacks. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=323.0s)]
*  And I think in Romania and in general people have started to see that [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=328.0s)]
*  there has never been such a big difference between the two candidates. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=333.0s)]
*  Personal but also professional. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=336.0s)]
*  One was a football hooligan who was extremely confident and to a certain extent had a big ego. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=338.0s)]
*  And the other one was a modest, educated mathematician who won the Olympiad twice, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=345.0s)]
*  who was re-elected in Bucharest, who really proved that his campaign, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=354.0s)]
*  an honest Romania, was more than just a campaign. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=360.0s)]
*  Andre Popovici, thank you very much for coming on the programme. Thank you. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhdtwN8o_E&t=363.0s)]
