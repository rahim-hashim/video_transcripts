Video Description: President Trump has attacked Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, calling him a "dictator" and deepening the rift between the two leaders.
 
It comes after Zelensky, reacting to US-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia from which Kyiv was excluded, said the US president was "living in a disinformation space" governed by Moscow.
 
The "dictator" slur quickly prompted criticism from European leaders including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who said "it is simply wrong and dangerous to deny President Zelensky his democratic legitimacy".
 
UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer made it clear he backed Zelensky in a phone call to the Ukrainian president.

# What is the rift between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky? | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas)
*  To Ukraine now, President Trump has deepened the rift with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=0.0s)]
*  commenting both on social media and at an event in Florida. Mr Trump claimed Ukraine started the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=5.76s)]
*  war with Russia and that his Ukrainian counterpart was a dictator because he didn't hold elections [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=11.36s)]
*  last year. President Zelensky's term expired last May but voting was legally suspended because of [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=16.8s)]
*  the war. Earlier, President Zelensky accused his American counterpart of living in a disinformation [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=23.28s)]
*  space with Mr Trump having claimed Kyiv could have made a deal a long time ago to end the war. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=29.44s)]
*  The British Prime Minister has expressed his support for Ukraine's President Zelensky. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=35.84s)]
*  Sir Keir Starmer spoke to the Ukrainian President on Wednesday and stressed the need for everyone [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=40.0s)]
*  to work together describing Mr Zelensky as Ukraine's democratically elected leader. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=44.96s)]
*  The past few days have shaken international diplomacy on the conflict with Vladimir Putin [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=50.88s)]
*  describing talks between US and Russian officials this week as extremely friendly. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=55.68s)]
*  Ukraine wasn't invited. Our North America correspondent Merlin Thomas has this report. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=60.56s)]
*  A deepening rift between the United States and Ukraine. After President Trump spent the day [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=66.24s)]
*  attacking Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky calling him a dictator, the US leader doubled [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=71.44s)]
*  down on his comments at a conference in Florida. He's pretty easy, pretty easy. A dictator without [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=76.88s)]
*  elections, Zelensky better move fast or he's not going to have a country left. Gotta move, gotta move [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=83.76s)]
*  fast because that war is going in the wrong direction. In the meantime, we're successfully [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=89.28s)]
*  negotiating an end to the war with Russia. Speaking to reporters on board Air Force One, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=94.08000000000001s)]
*  President Trump was asked if he trusts Russia is negotiating in good faith. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  I do. I think the Russians want to see the war end and I do, I really do. But I think they have [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=105.52000000000001s)]
*  the cards a little bit because you know they're they've taken a lot of territory so they have the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=112.8s)]
*  cards. In a phone call with Mr Zelensky last night, Prime Minister Sikir Starmer reaffirmed [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=118.39999999999999s)]
*  his support to Ukraine and gave his backing to efforts to achieve long-lasting peace. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=124.47999999999999s)]
*  In response, President Zelensky wrote on X, we will never forget the respect the British people [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=129.92s)]
*  have shown for Ukraine and our citizens. President Trump's scathing comments will have been welcomed [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=135.35999999999999s)]
*  by Moscow. For many, Mr Trump's words echo Kremlin talking points who for so long have sought to [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=140.8s)]
*  change power in Ukraine. We believe that since his legitimacy has come to an end May last year, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=147.12s)]
*  he should be he should have elections since we do not see how we can negotiate with him something [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=154.8s)]
*  because if he fails to put his signature under any kind of agreement and tomorrow he will not [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=162.24s)]
*  be elected as the president so this piece of paper will have not much of value. But Mr Zelensky was [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=168.08s)]
*  democratically elected in 2019 before the war. His five-year term was due to come to an end in May [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=176.24s)]
*  2024 but since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, elections have been legally postponed. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=182.96s)]
*  The war of words between the leaders began after Mr Zelensky said the U.S. president was living in [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=189.28s)]
*  a disinformation space governed by Moscow. President Zelensky is caught at a fragile moment. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=194.4s)]
*  After nearly three years of brutal war, he needs all the support he can get [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=201.12s)]
*  but it's clear that it won't be from President Trump. Merlin Thomas, BBC News, Washington. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=206.24s)]
*  Well our Russia editor Steve Rosenberg had the latest update on how Moscow is reacting to the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=213.44s)]
*  latest comments from President Trump. Well it will come as no surprise to you I think to hear [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=218.32s)]
*  that this is all going down very well in Moscow. The Russians are very pleased, very confident. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=223.52s)]
*  They love hearing Donald Trump's criticism of President Zelensky. On the front page of the [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=230.24s)]
*  Izvestia newspaper today there's a big photograph of Vladimir Putin looking very happy, smiling, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=236.64000000000001s)]
*  talking about how well the U.S.-Russia talks have been going, the talks in Saudi Arabia earlier this [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=242.0s)]
*  week and there's a big article in the government paper today, which talks about Donald Trump [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=249.12s)]
*  demanding elections in Ukraine and concluding the paper says Washington has started the process [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=257.04s)]
*  for the of the destruction of Zelensky's image. Of course the Russians are pleased because we've [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=263.6s)]
*  gone from a situation where there was an American president Joe Biden who called Vladimir Putin a [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=269.76s)]
*  murderous dictator to a situation where we have an American president Donald Trump who now calls [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=275.6s)]
*  the president of Ukraine a dictator without elections and an American president who appears [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=280.48s)]
*  happy to embrace Russian narratives on the war in Ukraine and to spread those narratives [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=287.6s)]
*  who doesn't criticize at all Vladimir Putin for Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  three years ago and on top of that an American president who is picking fights with America's [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=300.4s)]
*  traditional allies and weakening transatlantic ties. So if you put all that together [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=306.71999999999997s)]
*  that kind of explains why Vladimir Putin is smiling in that photograph on the front page [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=312.23999999999995s)]
*  of a Russian newspaper today. Let's speak to our Ukraine correspondent James Waterhouse now who is [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=317.03999999999996s)]
*  in Kyiv. Hi James, good to see you. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky due to meet U.S. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=322.4s)]
*  envoy for the Russia-Ukraine war, Keith Kellogg, in the next few hours. How crucial is that meeting [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=328.48s)]
*  going to be? That is not clear to be honest with you. We haven't had much in the way of an itinerary [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=333.68s)]
*  and with all of these insults from Donald Trump there's almost brinkmanship he's trying to bring [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=342.88s)]
*  into the proceedings over Ukraine's very future. Mr Kellogg, he wasn't involved in the Saudi talks, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=348.88s)]
*  in his words he is here to listen. So it's a bit of an awkward foundations for a diplomatic visit. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=358.48s)]
*  I think his hosts are looking to show him what they describe as the full picture by taking him [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=364.72s)]
*  to the front lines and showing him the full horrors of Russia's invasion but as for going [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=368.88s)]
*  beyond that I think we are seeing a more diplomatic tone being adopted by president Zelensky. He is [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=375.68s)]
*  looking to continue what he described as a constructive cooperation between America [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=381.68s)]
*  and Ukraine because he's still frank about the fact that he is reliant on the U.S. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=390.40000000000003s)]
*  in its continued fight against Russia. So while you're having these extraordinary allegations [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=395.76s)]
*  and insults going one way I think president Zelensky is looking to keep today constructive [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=402.48s)]
*  and civil because what is crucial for Ukraine is how Keith Kellogg then goes back to his boss in [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=408.64s)]
*  Washington and relays Ukraine's concerns. He is a retired general himself he might say look [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=415.44s)]
*  we need to maintain our support that's certainly going to be the hope here but these are interesting [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=422.47999999999996s)]
*  diplomatic times. Okay we'll continue to monitor this and get the latest on that visit throughout [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=427.68s)]
*  the day. For now though James thank you. Let's speak to our political correspondent Harry Farley [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=432.0s)]
*  now who's in Westminster. Harry last night to Keir Starmer backed Volodymyr Zelensky saying he [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=437.28s)]
*  is a democratically elected leader. What's the significance of him coming out squarely and backing [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=442.96s)]
*  president Zelensky? I think the significance is that over the last few weeks we've seen ministers [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=449.44s)]
*  be reluctant frankly to criticize Donald Trump to even appear to differ from his positions but not so [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=455.28s)]
*  last night. Often we get these readouts which is sort of the government's official interpretation [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=462.48s)]
*  of what was said in a call between a world leader and a prime minister and often they're quite bland [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=467.68s)]
*  they're quite nuanced and you have to sort of read between the lines to try and work out what's going [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=472.40000000000003s)]
*  on. No need for that last night. Downing Street's summary of the call between Sekeir Starmer and [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=475.84000000000003s)]
*  Volodymyr Zelensky went out of its way to describe president Zelensky as Ukraine's democratically [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=481.12s)]
*  elected leader and said it was perfectly reasonable to suspend elections during wartime as the UK did [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=487.28s)]
*  during World War II. So directly contradicting Donald Trump earlier in the day who had described [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=492.96s)]
*  Zelensky as a dictator without elections after Ukraine obviously suspended elections last year [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=498.32s)]
*  because of that war. Remember the prime minister Keir Starmer heads to Washington next week and [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=503.67999999999995s)]
*  that was already going to be a significant trip for his premiership and that the stakes for that [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=509.28s)]
*  visit has only increased in the last few days particularly for what it will mean for the UK's [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=515.76s)]
*  wider relationship with the US and that has implications not just for Ukraine not just for [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=521.6s)]
*  Europe but for all of us here in the UK as well when you think about that wider relationship with [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=527.36s)]
*  the US and the implications for trade and for the exemptions that the UK wants to carve out when it [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=532.64s)]
*  comes to tariffs in particular. Okay Harry for now thank you. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLQumwlqgas&t=539.04s)]
