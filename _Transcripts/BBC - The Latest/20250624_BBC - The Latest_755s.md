Video Description: Iran has denied firing missiles at Israel after the ceasefire began, according to Iranian state media.
 
Israel's Defence Minister Israel Katz accused Iran of violating the ceasefire just two hours after agreeing to the deal brokered by US President Donald Trump and Qatar.
 
Katz vowed to "respond forcefully to Iran's violation of the ceasefire with intense strikes against regime targets in the heart of Tehran".
 
Iran's security council warned that "any further aggression will be met with a decisive, firm, and timely response".
Before the ceasefire took effect, both countries exchanged heavy fire overnight - Israel said at least four people died in the southern town of Beersheba.

*  Please do not violate it before signing off, Donald J Trump, President of the United States. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=39.2s)]
*  President Trump's ceasefire announcement coming just a few hours after Iran launched missiles [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=49.08s)]
*  in Qatar that was in response to American strikes on its nuclear sites at the weekend. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=54.76s)]
*  There was a statement from Iran that said six missiles were launched. That's the same [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=60.12s)]
*  number as used in the American attack on its nuclear site in Fordow, you'll remember. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=64.56s)]
*  The comments from all three nations follow four waves of Iranian missile strikes against [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=72.56s)]
*  territory. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=79.12s)]
*  But Israel's defence forces say six rounds of strikes hit the country in a two-hour time [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  span. These are the live pictures from Be'er Sheba, just south of Tel Aviv where we are. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=86.28s)]
*  It's one of the areas that was hit. Rescue workers say four people have been killed there. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=92.2s)]
*  People across Israel were woken early to the sounds of missile alerts on their phones. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=97.72s)]
*  We had four successive alerts on our phones warning us and warning millions of Israelis [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=103.16s)]
*  to head to shelters. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=108.47999999999999s)]
*  I'm going to show you now the moment of a missile strike hitting that southern town [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=110.52s)]
*  of Be'er Sheba, a warning that you may find it distressing. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=115.6s)]
*  The emergency services say among those who died were a woman and a man in their 40s and [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=122.6s)]
*  a man in his 20s. They were all in their safe room at the time that the missile hit. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=128.32s)]
*  Reports from Iran quoting a regional governor in the province of Gilan say that nine people [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=135.16s)]
*  were killed early on Tuesday in Israeli strikes there. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=140.84s)]
*  Live now to our correspondent, Dan Johnson, who is in Jerusalem. Dan, just bring us right [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=147.06s)]
*  up to date first of all with that Be'er Sheba attack and also with the allegations of Iranian [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=151.9s)]
*  missiles into northern Israel this morning. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=157.9s)]
*  Yes, let's try and talk you through the timeline here. Israelis were woken up by air raid sirens [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=162.62s)]
*  sounding at 5am this morning, told to take shelter because of that successive waves of [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=169.42000000000002s)]
*  different Iranian missile attacks. Six of them in total that hit different parts of [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=175.02s)]
*  the country. Most of the missiles intercepted by the air defence but some of them able to [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=180.22s)]
*  get through. At least one direct hit in Be'er Sheba in the south of Israel. That is where [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=184.66s)]
*  four Israelis were killed. There were more than 20 people injured in that part of the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=189.9s)]
*  country. Emergency teams had to conduct a big operation there going through the rubble [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=194.06s)]
*  trying to reach those casualties. That was all happening very early this morning just [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=200.7s)]
*  as Israelis were reading the news that a ceasefire had been proposed and apparently [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=206.06s)]
*  agreed. There was no confirmation of that by the Israelis for quite a few hours but [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=210.54s)]
*  at 7am local time after that wave of Iranian strikes the skies went quiet and it did seem [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=214.86s)]
*  like things were calming down. Then after that we got the confirmation from the Israelis [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=220.86s)]
*  that they had agreed the terms of this plan. There was a question about exactly when it [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=225.2s)]
*  would come into force but the Israelis said they were willing to sign up to it having [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=229.82s)]
*  achieved their aims in terms of eradicating the threat of Iran's nuclear programme and [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=233.58s)]
*  the ballistic missiles that have been fired repeatedly towards this country over the course [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=238.70000000000002s)]
*  of this conflict over the last 12 days. Then just about an hour after that the air raid [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=242.58s)]
*  sirens went off again in the north of Israel around Haifa and that is when this single [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=248.66000000000003s)]
*  Iranian missile was fired. The Israelis say after the ceasefire and in breach of it. The [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=253.14000000000001s)]
*  Iranians are denying that. What has gone on here? Is there some sort of misstep, miscalculation, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=259.1s)]
*  some rogue launch that the Iranian command had not actually ordered? It is unclear. The [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=263.74s)]
*  Iranians deny it but the Israelis are taking it as a deliberate violation of the ceasefire. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=269.26000000000005s)]
*  The defence minister has promised that there will be significant strikes in retaliation. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=274.94s)]
*  So now the hopes of peace, the hope of that ceasefire deal taking effect, all depends [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=280.26000000000005s)]
*  on exactly what the Israelis do, what the scale and extent of those retaliation strikes [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=285.64s)]
*  are if indeed they come. Dan, for the moment thanks very much indeed. Yes, the Israeli [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=290.59999999999997s)]
*  defence minister said that we will forcefully respond to what he calls Iran's ceasefire [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=296.02s)]
*  violation. The far right finance minister has said Tehran will shake. Let's bring in [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=301.24s)]
*  David who joins us from Be'er Sheba, the scene of that deadly attack this morning. We're [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=310.56s)]
*  just bringing us right up to date with the scene there. Yes, well this is as you say [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=316.24s)]
*  Be'er Sheba, it's a city of about 200,000 people, so a big city in the south just in [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=322.0s)]
*  the Negev desert. But it has been struck several times over the last couple of weeks and this [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=327.92s)]
*  is the scene of the latest strike at about 5.45 local time this morning. If I just step [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=333.28s)]
*  back and I'll allow the cameraman is going to show you the continuing rescue work going [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=338.59999999999997s)]
*  on behind me. There's a ladder going up to the top of the building there. Now there were [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=342.88s)]
*  four people killed inside that building. I've just been speaking to the head of the Zaka [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=347.08s)]
*  search and rescue teams here. One of their members is on that ladder up there now. And [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=352.4s)]
*  he told me that the four people that were killed, at least three of them were inside [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=357.32s)]
*  their safe rooms. So they were observing the missile warning, they were inside their safe [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=361.59999999999997s)]
*  room when this building, this residential building, took a direct hit from what appears [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=366.92s)]
*  to be a ballistic missile. It's a massive, massive bomb site and there's been superficial [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=372.52000000000004s)]
*  damage in the areas around here. Many shop windows, many house windows have had their [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=378.04s)]
*  glass put out. Buildings around here are all damaged and there is a search and recovery [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=383.24s)]
*  operation going on there as we speak. So this happened technically just before the ceasefire [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=388.34000000000003s)]
*  came into place. But of course after the other missile alert which Dan mentioned, the Israeli [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=395.84s)]
*  defence minister said that there would be now powerful strikes against regime targets [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=402.2s)]
*  in Iran. So it's very, it's a big question whether the ceasefire is going to hold a minute. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=407.96s)]
*  But again here in Basheba the scene is one of pretty complete destruction and devastation [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=413.32s)]
*  in this one particular building, a city that has been hit several times over the last couple [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=419.67999999999995s)]
*  of weeks. And we're at the Israelis have said that there have been at least 50 direct impacts [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=424.08s)]
*  of Iranian missiles over the last 12 days that have breached Israel's defence shields. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=430.35999999999996s)]
*  Obviously there's going to be a lot of grief where you are but have you detected, have [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=436.28s)]
*  you spoken to anybody there about their appetite for a ceasefire and for this conflict to come [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=439.28s)]
*  to an end? Do they want this promised ceasefire or do they want Israel to keep going? Well [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=444.28s)]
*  the Israeli government says it has completely or very much put back and severely damaged [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=452.47999999999996s)]
*  Iran's nuclear programme. But it also says it has severely damaged Iran's ballistic missile [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=458.03999999999996s)]
*  capabilities. This incident alone may put that question, that statement into question. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=464.35999999999996s)]
*  And there are fears in Israel and of course in the wider region that if the ceasefire [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=470.71999999999997s)]
*  between Israel and Iran doesn't hold it could grow into something much more, much bigger [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=474.52s)]
*  not just encompassing the two countries but also as we saw yesterday in Qatar and other [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=479.96s)]
*  parts of this region. So there are hopes on both sides and in the wider region that the [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=485.28s)]
*  ceasefire does hold because clearly both sides do have the capability militarily to damage [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=490.8s)]
*  each other very badly. We know that several hundred people have been killed in Iran over [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=497.03999999999996s)]
*  the last 12 days. In Israel now there have been 28 people killed. And if this kind of [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=501.64s)]
*  thing were to continue then the potential for more deaths on both sides is critically [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=506.64s)]
*  and certainly there. So yes there is support for a ceasefire. An off ramp for both countries [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=511.84s)]
*  would allow the Israeli Prime Minister to claim victory certainly over Iran's nuclear [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=517.28s)]
*  ambitions and it would also from an Iranian perspective allow the Iranian regime to remain [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=523.16s)]
*  in power. Do you remember now that the Iranian regime is still in power, the supreme leader [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=529.48s)]
*  is still alive and there are many in Israel, there are some in Israel on the hard right [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=534.48s)]
*  who would like their government to go further but perhaps an off ramp is the best thing [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=538.24s)]
*  for both sides now. We're with Davis live with us from Be'er Sheba thanks very much [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=541.92s)]
*  indeed. Well let's go over to the Armenia Iran border and join our correspondent Andrew [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=548.52s)]
*  Harding who is there. Andrew just paint the picture of where you are and what people there [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=555.52s)]
*  are telling you fleeing Iran. It's a pretty remote region, the green valley you can see [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=561.5600000000001s)]
*  behind me with the river marks the border between Iran and Armenia and the mountains [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=569.08s)]
*  in the background there are Armenian territory and there's a very small border crossing which [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=574.76s)]
*  has been used, been quite busy in recent days, Iranians starting to trickle out in their [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=580.32s)]
*  dozens in their hundreds, not a flood certainly but people who say they are escaping the violence, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=586.12s)]
*  a lot of them have driven from Tehran and other big cities. This morning we've been [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=592.16s)]
*  speaking to some of them, they're aware, most people of the ceasefire but I'd say a mood [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=596.4s)]
*  of some skepticism about whether it will last. One man said to me I don't believe anything [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=602.24s)]
*  that Donald Trump says. What we have here is a very small partial window onto what's [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=607.52s)]
*  going on inside Iran itself because most of the people leaving and indeed most of the [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=613.76s)]
*  people willing to speak to us are Iranians who have foreign passports so these are people [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=618.88s)]
*  who may be visiting Iran and now leaving in the only way they can find a safe route out [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=624.16s)]
*  and so they have a particular perspective, most of them critical of the regime. I spoke [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=629.88s)]
*  to one woman this morning who had left the country with her young son, they said they'd [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=635.0s)]
*  been about a kilometer away from a bomb attack in Tehran itself, they were planning to spend [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=639.76s)]
*  maybe a couple of weeks now inside Armenia to see if the ceasefire was going to take [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=646.76s)]
*  hold. I asked her what the mood was inside Iran itself and the attitude towards American [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=651.76s)]
*  and Israeli strikes and she said look from our perspective and the mood of people she [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=658.76s)]
*  knows is that Iranians in general do not want to see democracy change forced on them [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrGxwEXtw0&t=663.24s)]
