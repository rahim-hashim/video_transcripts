# Why the F-16 is one of Natoâ€™s most important fighter jets | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA)
*  December 1973 in Fort Worth, Texas. After just 21 months of development, the prototype [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=0.0s)]
*  to what was to become the F-16 was presented. The first successful flight happened just [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=16.22s)]
*  two months later. The iconic bubble canopy to give the pilot great all-round visibility [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=24.62s)]
*  and inside a first of its kind fly-by-wire control system where computers fly the aircraft [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=32.9s)]
*  according to how the pilot applies pressure to the controls. The sum of all that is a [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=40.22s)]
*  fighter jet that is extremely maneuverable and has been used for a lot of different types [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=50.82s)]
*  of combat missions around the world. The YF-16 is everything an air combat fighter has to [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=55.54s)]
*  be. It is nimble, maneuverable. Fast forward more than 50 years and the shape is more or [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=61.06s)]
*  less the same. But inside, everything is upgraded. And that's badly needed, NATO says, because [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=72.38s)]
*  of the threat from Russia over the past few years. February 2025 and there's a flurry [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=83.74s)]
*  of diplomatic activity about a possible peace deal. All the while, Ukraine continues defending [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=93.66s)]
*  itself against attacks. And those attacks highlight, the country says, the need to replace [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=100.3s)]
*  aging Soviet-era jets with modern Western aircraft. For the first group of pilots who [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=107.3s)]
*  arrived in Ukraine and started using them in the Ukrainian sky, the main priority is [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=115.74s)]
*  air defense. F-16s are wonderful interceptor planes. That's what they were created for, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=121.3s)]
*  to intercept targets in the air. But there are also multipurpose planes which can attack [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=127.38s)]
*  targets on the land and on the water. But we're now at the stage of using F-16 planes [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=133.46s)]
*  effectively to intercept targets in the air, such as cruise missiles and the enemy's Shahed [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=138.62s)]
*  drones. The F-16 is the first Western fighter jet the Ukrainians have started operating. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=144.5s)]
*  So I've come to Spengalim Air Base in Germany. It's a chilly week in January and I'm meeting [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=154.54s)]
*  the 52nd Fighter Wing of the US Air Force. They host the 480th Fighter Squadron of F-16 [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=160.22s)]
*  jets. This squadron has no involvement in the war in Ukraine, but they do specialize [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=167.54s)]
*  in flying missions very similar to the ones Ukrainians are flying. And here they're very [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=173.14s)]
*  about the threat from Russia. My visit took place just days before President Trump returned [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=178.78s)]
*  to the White House. I think it's right in our face. I think even till February 23rd, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=185.42s)]
*  2022, many people were saying Russia's not going to invade, it's not going to happen, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=191.74s)]
*  and then it happened. And so I think that brought it very, very clear in people's minds [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=197.34s)]
*  that the threat of Russia on NATO territory is higher than we anticipated it being. We've [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=202.1s)]
*  been given special access to the squadron. We'll get to see the hangars and sit in on [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=209.38s)]
*  a training mission before an actual trip in the F-16. This squadron flies a very particular [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=214.29999999999998s)]
*  type of mission. Pilots head towards the feared surface-to-air missile sites, seeking out [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=222.98s)]
*  and destroying them with missiles to protect friendly aircraft. They also fly defensive [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=229.01999999999998s)]
*  counter-air missions, those designed to defend airspace. That's very similar to the way [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=235.1s)]
*  Ukraine uses their F-16s. As part of my trip, I get to fly the aircraft too. But first, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=240.33999999999997s)]
*  some training. Kind of an awkward process. You never really get too good at it. Including [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=250.45999999999998s)]
*  parachute familiarisation. That was annoying. That's right where you'd want to land in [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=255.98s)]
*  real life though. What we can do now is find that big aircraft carrier. So you see it to [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=260.42s)]
*  the left? Yeah. So try and steer towards it. And how to eject if there's an emergency. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=264.18s)]
*  The jet will do all the work. All you have to do is sit there and enjoy it. Kind of feels [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=274.78s)]
*  like a massage. Then I sit in on a training mission briefing. Here the crews talk about [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=278.94s)]
*  dealing with a simulated cruise missile and drone attack. Captain Jinx leads a session. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=284.06s)]
*  We will bite, take, bite, take, bite, come home. My pilot today has a call sign Grim. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=289.58s)]
*  He takes me through safety procedures. The hot mic's going to allow us to talk inner [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=296.94s)]
*  cockpit to each other and the intercom's going to be that volume between just you and I. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=300.86s)]
*  Then we're on our way to the jet. This is it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=307.18s)]
*  Here we go. We're off. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=314.06s)]
*  Ready? Ready. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=333.06s)]
*  Captain Grim gives the jet full power for takeoff. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=339.06s)]
*  And in case you're wondering, those are dummy missiles on the jet. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=352.06s)]
*  One point out. You're supersonic. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=368.06s)]
*  Whoa. Here I am at a 16, flying at 38,000 feet and we're flying supersonic. Fastest [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=373.06s)]
*  we've ever seen. Somewhere over Germany. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=381.06s)]
*  A vital part of flying military jets is refueling in the air because missions can be long. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=384.06s)]
*  Then I fly the plane. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=391.06s)]
*  Okay, here we are at 16,000 feet. I have control on that 16, fighting Falcon. Can I [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=396.06s)]
*  raise, pull the stick back gently? Can I turn it around? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=407.06s)]
*  I'm trying to be sensitive. Pull it back, pull it back, pull it back. 11,000 again. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=421.06s)]
*  Going up to 18,000 feet and 11,000 fighting. I think I'm busted by high. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=429.06s)]
*  Nope, you're going to point out. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=438.06s)]
*  To check out how responsive the jet is, I do a couple of maneuvers, starting with a roll. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=440.06s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=445.06s)]
*  And a roll left. One. And a roll right, coming up. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=448.06s)]
*  Boom. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=462.06s)]
*  I've never flown a real jet before, but flying this is intuitive, using a stick to my right [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=464.06s)]
*  to change direction and a throttle lever on my left to alter speed. Dual controls means [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=472.06s)]
*  the pilot can take back the plane at any time. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=478.06s)]
*  Okay, I'm back in control of the F-16. Trying to make 10 level flight. And we just called [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=481.06s)]
*  some serious Gs, got the 6G, incredibly maneuverable. Of course, this is the jet, which is used [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=488.06s)]
*  in countries, NATO countries, and then aced into Ukraine. And Ukrainian pilots are flying [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=502.06s)]
*  this day in, day out. For missions, to try to knock out cruise missiles and drones which [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=508.06s)]
*  are attacking Ukrainian cities and facilities. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=516.06s)]
*  Flying the jet subjects you to incredible forces. Here, only the harness is keeping [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=525.06s)]
*  me in the seat. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=531.06s)]
*  Alright, Christian, give me a right for left hand, 180 degree turn. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=538.06s)]
*  Yep. Got to go left, 180. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=541.06s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=544.06s)]
*  Okay, turning left 180. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=555.06s)]
*  I'm going to go up a battery, but I don't want to die. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=557.06s)]
*  You have to look down into your legs to see if compass is in the air. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=561.06s)]
*  Generally, yes. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=565.06s)]
*  Okay, rising sun, limiting arms. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=569.06s)]
*  I hit a G, apparently. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=573.06s)]
*  Another A1 rail right, coming up, 3, 2, 1, instant response. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=575.06s)]
*  Here we are, flying back up. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=587.06s)]
*  Going to do a sharp left turn, you going to have me? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=591.06s)]
*  Yep, you can go ahead. I'll go, stay on the controls. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=594.06s)]
*  Okay, thank you. Get up to Bill Frost, get up to 350 knots. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=597.06s)]
*  I'll have a second, go. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=603.06s)]
*  Alright, you have me. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=605.06s)]
*  After an hour in the air, Grim flies us back to base. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=607.06s)]
*  And once through the cloud, we're on the ground. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=610.06s)]
*  Thank you very much for today. That was an incredible experience. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=617.06s)]
*  You did great. It was awesome. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=619.06s)]
*  Just tell me about the aircraft, how long have you been flying it? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=621.06s)]
*  So I've been flying the F-16 for about five years now. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=623.06s)]
*  Phenomenal aircraft to fly. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=626.06s)]
*  As you were saying, we've had them for 50 years, so it's an older jet, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=628.06s)]
*  but constantly doing updates and it's great. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=631.06s)]
*  I'd want to fly nothing else. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=636.06s)]
*  Further east of here, F-16s continue to play an important role, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=639.06s)]
*  protecting the skies over Ukraine. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=642.06s)]
*  At the moment, the F-16s in Ukraine are in many ways kind of the vanguard [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=645.06s)]
*  for what is planned to be a build-up to a much greater force, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=650.06s)]
*  as particularly a new generation of Ukrainian pilots [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=654.06s)]
*  who've been trained from the outset by Western Air Forces, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=657.06s)]
*  who are kind of going through a F-16 conversion. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=660.06s)]
*  As for this US squadron, its role is pivotal in Europe. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=663.06s)]
*  But with a new president, potentially different priorities. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=667.06s)]
*  Five years ago, Donald Trump suggested pulling some US forces out of Germany [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=673.06s)]
*  to be relocated elsewhere in Europe. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=677.06s)]
*  No word yet on what the new administration may or may not do, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=682.06s)]
*  but the US Air Force leadership in Europe says American forces [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=686.06s)]
*  will be ready for whatever is decided. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=690.06s)]
*  Look, at our level in the military, you know our relationships. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=693.06s)]
*  We have some civilian control, direction of the military. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=697.06s)]
*  I expect policy changes to occur, have no idea what those are, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=701.06s)]
*  but I can assure you what I do expect is they will be direct, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=705.06s)]
*  they will be clear, we will know their intent, and we will move out. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=708.06s)]
*  And we'll execute those policies from a military perspective [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=712.06s)]
*  and a diplomacy perspective as well. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=716.06s)]
*  You know, when that comes through the administration, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=719.06s)]
*  but I think through the National Security Advisors, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=722.06s)]
*  now Security Council, through the Cabinet, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=725.06s)]
*  they're going to sort their game plan and we'll be ready to execute. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=729.06s)]
*  A month after we filmed this, President Trump put defence spending [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=736.06s)]
*  at the centre of debate for European security and the war in Ukraine. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=740.06s)]
*  This squadron at Spangdalan delivers what the fighter wing describes [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=748.06s)]
*  as world-class support to conduct wartime and contingency missions, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=752.06s)]
*  underpinned by aircraft maintainers and operational teams, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=756.06s)]
*  in defending the skies here and beyond. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKEGMYg2EA&t=760.06s)]
