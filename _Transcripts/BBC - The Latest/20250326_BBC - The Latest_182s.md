Video Description: Russia has said some Western sanctions must be lifted before it begins a maritime ceasefire with Ukraine.
 
Within hours of the US announcing the two sides had agreed to halt strikes in the Black Sea in separate deals, the Kremlin said it would only take place once sanctions on a number of Russian banks were lifted.
 
The demands include revoking sanctions on the state agricultural bank Rosselkhozbank and restoring the firms' access to the Swift international payment system.
 
Overnight, Moscow launched a drone attack on the port city of Mykolaiv, Ukrainian officials said, with President Volodymyr Zelensky saying the strikes were "a clear signal" Russia did not want peace.

*  Let's turn to Ukraine now, where Tuesday's breakthrough agreement to end fighting in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=0.0s)]
*  the Black Sea is already showing some cracks. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=5.16s)]
*  Russia has insisted the limited maritime ceasefire will come into force only after certain sanctions [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=8.2s)]
*  have been lifted. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  The US made the deal, but the EU has said that Russia's unconditional withdrawal from [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  Ukraine would be needed in order for it to lift sanctions. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=18.88s)]
*  Ukraine for its part has said that the limited ceasefire should begin immediately, and the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=22.64s)]
*  deal, which was agreed by the US, Russia and Ukraine with two separate deals, promised [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=26.32s)]
*  to ensure safe navigation and eliminate the use of force in the Black Sea, and to work [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=32.68s)]
*  towards a ban on strikes on the energy facilities of both Russia and Ukraine. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=37.88s)]
*  Our diplomatic correspondent James Landale is in Kiev. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=42.24s)]
*  He says enforcing this deal may not be straightforward. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=44.56s)]
*  Well essentially the ones that are at stake at the moment relate to agriculture and fertiliser [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=48.64s)]
*  because essentially, which is a, it sounds prosaic, but it's a huge market. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=54.96s)]
*  And essentially the issue is this. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=61.48s)]
*  When there was that now infamous Black Sea grain initiative, which was the deal that [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=63.44s)]
*  lasted for about a year between the summer of 2022 and the summer of 2023, that was essentially [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  a deal that said, right, Russia will agree to stop attacking Ukrainian shipping and other [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=74.47999999999999s)]
*  commercial shipping that's going in and out to Ukraine, getting this grain out to the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=79.32s)]
*  world. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=82.68s)]
*  In return, Russia would be able to have a lifting of economic sanctions for its own [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=83.84s)]
*  grain and fertiliser products. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=88.48s)]
*  What happened is that Russia agreed to that deal, Ukraine started getting its shipping [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  out, but then Ukraine said, well, we're still having trouble getting our grain out. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=95.76s)]
*  Although sanctions had been lifted, Russia argued that other sort of secondary sanctions [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  and other restrictions were making it harder. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  In other words, they were finding it hard to raise the finance to pay for the shipping [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=109.04s)]
*  to get the grain out. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=114.0s)]
*  They were finding it hard to get the insurance to cover the ships that were taking the grain [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=115.04s)]
*  out. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=121.08000000000001s)]
*  They were finding it hard to make the transactions because they were being excluded from other [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=122.08000000000001s)]
*  financial networks. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=126.0s)]
*  Now one of those networks is a thing called Swift, which is an international financial [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=127.2s)]
*  messaging and transaction system, which Russia is currently excluded from. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=132.8s)]
*  The Russians are saying, you need to include us again so that we can agree to this ceasefire. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=137.64s)]
*  That is not entirely a decision of the United States, that is also a decision that involves [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=143.16s)]
*  the European Union. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=147.2s)]
*  And so the question now is, will the European Union sign up to that? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=148.2s)]
*  Some analysts say that the Russians have done this simply because they want to cause another [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=152.23999999999998s)]
*  row, another point of friction between the Europeans and the Americans. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=157.04s)]
*  So the ball is very much at the moment, initially in the Americans' court, they have to make [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  a decision. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=165.32s)]
*  They have to be prepared to roll back these sanctions in return for getting a partial [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=166.32s)]
*  limited ceasefire in the Black Sea. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=170.84s)]
*  And if they are, what kind of pressure are they willing to put to bear on the Europeans [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  to get them to sign up to it? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=178.32s)]
*  James Landell there. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y0mm5_U-Cc&t=180.35999999999999s)]
