Video Description: US President Donald Trump says he thinks there will be a Ukraine peace deal and a US-UK trade deal after talks with UK PM Keir Starmer at the White House.
 
On Ukraine, Trump said a ceasefire will be agreed "soon" or "won't be at all."
 
He also said he respects President Zelensky and praised his military: "They have fought very bravely... somebody has to use that equipment and they have been very brave."
 
On a UK trade deal Trump said, "I think we could very well end up with a real trade deal where the tariffs wouldn't be necessary."
 
When asked by the BBC's Chris Mason if he still thinks Ukraine's President Zelensky is a dictator - Trump replied: "Did I say that? I can't believe I said that. Next question."

# Donald Trump says he's hopeful for Ukraine peace deal after talks with UK PM | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y)
*  The rain is coming down here in Washington DC outside the White House. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=0.0s)]
*  A little British farewell for the UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer who has just left [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=5.76s)]
*  here from the White House in the last 10 minutes or so. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=10.24s)]
*  Interestingly we saw President Trump come out just a moment ago back out through that [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=13.72s)]
*  portico of the West Wing with some members of the ground staff here at the White House [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=17.84s)]
*  seemingly examining the granite on the ground. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=22.04s)]
*  So I'm not too sure, I couldn't tell from this vantage what they were looking at but [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=24.76s)]
*  he's finished meeting with Keir Starmer and now he's concerned about the grounds in the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=28.639999999999997s)]
*  White House, the day in the life of an American President. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=32.36s)]
*  And we can just see now behind me that's the US or the travelling UK press pack who have [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=35.92s)]
*  travelled over here with the Prime Minister. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=42.48s)]
*  They're just leaving there behind us there. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  The Prime Minister left from a different entrance at the front of the White House. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=47.68s)]
*  There are a lot going on here today as you can imagine and we've just finished that press [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=51.84s)]
*  conference which was the last official moment of the visit of Keir Starmer to Donald Trump [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=56.72s)]
*  and of course the issue of Ukraine and security underpinning for any potential peace deal [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=62.36s)]
*  that may arise was discussed and this is a little of what was said. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=68.08s)]
*  I have a very good relationship with President Putin, I think I have a very good relationship [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=74.08s)]
*  with President Zelensky and now we're doing the deal and we're going to be in there, we're [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=78.08s)]
*  going to be actually in there digging our hearts out and hopefully we need the rare [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=82.72s)]
*  earth and we have some here but we don't have enough. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=90.6s)]
*  Our economy is very strong and we need a lot of things that in some cases we don't have [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=94.36s)]
*  here so I think we're going to have a very good relationship but the relationship between [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=99.32s)]
*  them is not the best. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=104.48s)]
*  Did I say that? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=105.48s)]
*  I can't believe I said that. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=113.12s)]
*  Next question. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=114.68s)]
*  Do you want to say something? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=115.68s)]
*  No I was just going to say, I mean the deal if we get it is going to be hugely important, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=116.68s)]
*  I don't think it would have happened if the space hadn't been created for it by yourself [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=120.92s)]
*  but if there's a deal in we've got to make sure it's a deal that lasts, that is not temporary [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=126.52000000000001s)]
*  and that's why we need to make sure that it's secure and we've lent in and said we'll play [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=131.54s)]
*  our part and we've talked and we will talk about how we work with yourself Mr. President [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=136.22s)]
*  to ensure that this deal is something which is not violated because it's very important [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=142.1s)]
*  if there is a deal we keep it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=146.1s)]
*  And I think I can say that will be the easy part, that's the part we look forward to because [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=150.22s)]
*  putting security there that's the part we all look forward to, that's easy. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=155.22s)]
*  The difficult part is getting the deal made so but I think we've come a long way. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=159.14s)]
*  So that just a little of the exchange between Keir Starmer and Donald Trump in the Oval [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=165.57999999999998s)]
*  Office this morning, that first press avail that they had. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=169.61999999999998s)]
*  Well let's bring in now Patrick Burey, he's a former NATO analyst and expert in security [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=173.05999999999997s)]
*  and warfare. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=178.26s)]
*  Patrick thanks for joining us. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=179.26s)]
*  A couple of mentions of NATO throughout the day. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=181.17999999999998s)]
*  Just at one point Donald Trump saying that NATO membership for Ukraine was definitely [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=184.7s)]
*  off the table but he was also asked a question there in the press conference about whether [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=189.14s)]
*  he supported Article 5 and he said I support Article 5 but it's not going to be needed. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=194.06s)]
*  What did you draw from what you heard today? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=201.33999999999997s)]
*  Good evening Katrina. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=204.54s)]
*  Yes, I think the point he made about Ukraine and NATO is just reiterating what Secretary [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=205.54s)]
*  Hegseth said last week so it wasn't really that new. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=212.45999999999998s)]
*  The new thing since his visit with or his hosting of Macron was that he mentioned that [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=216.22s)]
*  Ukraine he would like to see it get some or a lot of its land back so that will probably [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=221.73999999999998s)]
*  go down well especially in Ukraine and in the rest of Europe. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=226.01999999999998s)]
*  So it's a little bit of a walk back from what Secretary Hegseth said in terms of Ukraine [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=229.44s)]
*  would definitely have to give up a lot of it or a fair amount of its land to 18 or so [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=234.29999999999998s)]
*  percent that Russia holds of it. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=239.22s)]
*  So that's a bit of carrot and stick as it were. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=241.38s)]
*  On the NATO, yes it was interesting that it came from a question from the press corps [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=245.54s)]
*  and that he basically said he supports Article 5. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=248.74s)]
*  This is a result of a lack of clarity really since the Munich Security Conference and the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=252.66s)]
*  different messages coming from the US administration. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=257.34s)]
*  On the one hand Secretary Hegseth saying we want to make NATO great again but then on [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=260.82s)]
*  Vance the Vice President seeming to kind of distance himself from Europe. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=267.3s)]
*  So clearly Macron and Starmor's visit and again Zelensky's it's Europe week in the White [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=271.38s)]
*  House you know they're all there basically trying to get a bit of clarity. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=276.5s)]
*  It looks like they've got some more but I don't think on this backstop there's no clarity [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=280.1s)]
*  there yet. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=285.26s)]
*  And Patrick there didn't seem to be any movement at all on that issue of this security underpinning [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=287.56s)]
*  Despite the best efforts of President Macron on Monday and Keir Starmor today, Donald Trump [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=293.02000000000004s)]
*  still saying no not even going to discuss that we need to get a peace deal first. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=298.54s)]
*  Yeah long finger stuff isn't it. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=303.70000000000005s)]
*  I mean interestingly from the British perspective and I thought the Prime Minister played it [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=305.98s)]
*  was very well prepared and very canny throughout these press conferences and the visit at least [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=309.26s)]
*  but from the British perspective they'll be happy that the President said the UK military [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=313.54s)]
*  able to look after itself but also he was there to help if needed. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=319.38s)]
*  So there's a good there's a good indication there that at least some of the bilaterals [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=323.78s)]
*  and also the article five are holding but that is not going to be so far extended to [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=328.02s)]
*  anything inside any reassurance force that may deploy inside Ukraine. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=332.56s)]
*  There's an interesting thing here as well that the President is trying to say is that [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=337.58s)]
*  these contractors and they would be basically contractors i.e. extractive industry going [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=340.94s)]
*  into areas some of which are in the Donbass where a lot of the rare earths are but certainly [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=346.5s)]
*  into Ukraine and using them as some sort of you know almost guarantee that because these [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=350.97999999999996s)]
*  contractors are there they would not be attacked by Russia. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=358.38s)]
*  Like I've worked giving advice to the extractive industry in previous work and they tend to [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=361.34s)]
*  depending on the profits to be made they tend to move pretty fast out of high threat environments [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=368.34s)]
*  if there's a change. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=372.54s)]
*  So the idea I think is somewhat questionable I mean it would be very interesting to see [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=374.46000000000004s)]
*  what how that would look that this idea that just by having you know US contractors on [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=379.3s)]
*  the ground in a rare earth mine would stop another go again by Putin questionable. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=385.54s)]
*  Or indeed in an active conflict situation as it still is as we speak today. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=390.54s)]
*  Patrick Beurie as ever thanks for joining us here on BBC News. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=396.54s)]
*  Joining us is our panel Robbie Suave senior editor at Reason magazine democratic strategist [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=402.21999999999997s)]
*  Joy Cheney and also Leon Emerali former UK Ministerial aide and commentator and I want [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=409.34s)]
*  to begin by thanking you all so much for your patience you've been sitting there waiting [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=415.02s)]
*  obviously for quite a while while we listened to the press conference but let's get into [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=418.78s)]
*  some of the detail because we don't have as much time tonight as we normally would with [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=423.5s)]
*  our panel. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=428.3s)]
*  Robbie interestingly President Trump was talking about this in the press conference and earlier [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=430.78000000000003s)]
*  in the Oval Office when he was asked about those security guarantees we've heard about [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=434.94s)]
*  so much in the last week or so he said he was open to many things but first he wants [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=438.38s)]
*  to get Russia and Ukraine to agree a deal before being drawn on what measures would [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=444.42s)]
*  be in place to enforce it. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=448.86s)]
*  It sounds a bit though like a chicken and egg situation surely you need those measures [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=450.58000000000004s)]
*  in place potentially before you can get the deal. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=454.52s)]
*  I think that's accurate now we should all be happy I think depending on no matter where [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=458.94s)]
*  you are in this whole situation that there have been now some successful negotiations [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=464.74s)]
*  taking place. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=469.66s)]
*  The standpoint of so many in the Trump coalition in America is obviously that endless support [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=471.3s)]
*  for Ukraine cannot go on and we don't want to commit American military service people [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=477.22s)]
*  to the defense of Ukraine but it is interesting there Trump obviously saying well if we have [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=483.92s)]
*  this minerals deal then we'll want to defend our people who will be working there but we [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=488.34s)]
*  also don't want to put our people in harm's way and get into some broader conflict with [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=492.34s)]
*  Russia because we have people on the ground and they're still interested in conquering [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=496.7s)]
*  Ukraine so obviously what does have to happen next is conversations with Putin to bring [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=501.29999999999995s)]
*  an end to the conflict so it's true that this is not this does not get the deal done however [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=507.26s)]
*  I think it's a step in the right direction to have get everybody on the same page and [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=514.26s)]
*  hopefully bring this war to a immediate conclusion. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=518.4599999999999s)]
*  Joy from your perspective of watching what you heard from President Trump today and indeed [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=523.2199999999999s)]
*  the UK Prime Minister did he kind of roll back that shift in US foreign policy that [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=527.9799999999999s)]
*  we have seen the president and his administration make in the last few weeks? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=534.54s)]
*  Well I mean he certainly had to repair our reputation after what happened last week with [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=540.14s)]
*  the vice president's speech and then his own comments which he won't cop to this week that [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=545.2199999999999s)]
*  he called President Zelensky a terrorist so yes I mean for that it was I think a breath [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=550.06s)]
*  of relief for everyone in Europe that things are a little calmer this week but we all know [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=557.2199999999999s)]
*  with Donald Trump that you know there's always next week so it's going to be chaotic and [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=563.6199999999999s)]
*  we're going to have to learn to live in chaos for the foreseeable future with him in leadership [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=568.74s)]
*  but yeah I mean all in all it was a good meeting. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=573.58s)]
*  And Leon Emerali let me bring you in I was talking with one of our correspondents earlier [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=577.14s)]
*  about how much first President Macron's visit and now the UK Prime Minister's visit will [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=581.14s)]
*  have moved the needle in President Trump's mind ahead of this meeting with President [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=587.22s)]
*  Zelensky tomorrow you know once you actually get President Zelensky in the same room as [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=591.54s)]
*  President Trump and his team in the same room as the the Trump team do you think there is [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=597.14s)]
*  room for further progress on those security guarantees that President Zelensky clearly [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=602.86s)]
*  wants and that obviously France and the UK would like to see as well? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=607.1s)]
*  Well there's definitely room for further progress I think that's definitely what Zelensky wants [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=611.78s)]
*  to see it's whether or not Donald Trump wants to give those concessions but it's quite remarkable [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=616.22s)]
*  when you consider this week with Macron on Monday, Kirsten Amad today, Zelensky tomorrow [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=621.22s)]
*  this is going to be a week that will define Europe's future for many many decades to come [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=626.74s)]
*  and therefore I think that parts one and two have gone extremely well you know I think [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=632.46s)]
*  that both the Macron meeting both the Stama meeting have gone incredibly well it's now [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=638.58s)]
*  down to Zelensky and I think what will be missing with the Zelensky meeting is the warmth [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=642.74s)]
*  between the two individuals I think that we've seen that with both Macron and Stama you know [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=647.86s)]
*  a huge amount of warmth between the two the two the two men there but I do think that Zelensky [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=653.14s)]
*  and Trump have a slightly more frostier relationship and that could be a hurdle to Zelensky getting [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=658.22s)]
*  what what Ukraine wants in terms of that security guarantee. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=663.9399999999999s)]
*  Robbie though did we see a slight softening of that view of President Zelensky I mean President [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=667.1s)]
*  Trump was asked oh do you still think he's a dictator and he said oh did I say that did I [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=674.38s)]
*  say that and he also at another point said I've got a lot of respect for President Zelensky what [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=678.7s)]
*  do you think we'll see tomorrow? We have to always keep in mind that this is how Trump operates he [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=684.1800000000001s)]
*  comes from the world of business of making deals and also of entertainment and his negotiating [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=689.86s)]
*  strategy is often to talk very tough on social media confrontational and then have a meeting of [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=696.1800000000001s)]
*  the minds when he actually sits down with the world leader so I think despite you know what [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=703.5400000000001s)]
*  he said about Zelensky earlier I think there is going to be a desire to get a kind of deal again [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=708.38s)]
*  that brings the war to an end that involves the US jointly in an economic venture with Ukraine does [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=715.6600000000001s)]
*  tie us to the fate of that country but not in an open-ended endless just you know giving aid and [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=721.7800000000001s)]
*  arms to Ukraine something that there is not a lot of appetite to do among the American people [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=730.14s)]
*  particularly Republican-leaning American people anymore but we will still be we will be involved [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=735.58s)]
*  in the country of Ukraine and we will work out some kind of security arrangement maybe involving [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=740.86s)]
*  the rest of Europe maybe and explicitly certainly involving a conversation with Russia to not expand [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=744.94s)]
*  any further now I think unfortunately Ukraine will not be getting back the territory that that [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=753.0200000000001s)]
*  Russia has taken that just seems very difficult to get from a negotiation standpoint but good [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=758.1s)]
*  relations with Europe despite the the tough talk of last weekend and of recently I think that is [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=763.74s)]
*  the Trump approach to diplomacy and there is something to be said for it well let's pick up [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=769.98s)]
*  on the Trump approach to diplomacy with joy I mean we don't know in as much detail do we what is [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=775.74s)]
*  going on in terms of conversations between the Trump administration and Russia but here you have [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=781.46s)]
*  on the other side of this these very visible contacts France UK obviously President Zelensky [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=786.86s)]
*  tomorrow as we've been discussing I mean do you think that is going to make a huge difference [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=792.98s)]
*  actually those in-person contacts as opposed to contacts through a third party through a through [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=797.3000000000001s)]
*  a close aid to Donald Trump rather than the two-man meeting well I mean look this is the second Trump [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=804.0600000000001s)]
*  administration and people have figured him out anyone with you know bargain-basement psychology [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=811.9s)]
*  degree understands how to talk to him you have you can flatter him and that will you know earn [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=817.22s)]
*  you great favor and I think that many of them coming to him kissing the ring just a little bit [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=823.0600000000001s)]
*  is that actually manipulative and will work in their favor and I think that's what you're seeing [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=828.98s)]
*  this week that's not unusual that's common and that's I think that's what you see with the [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=834.5s)]
*  extension of the invitation from from King Charles it allows him to say I you know I'm the only [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=839.4200000000001s)]
*  American president has done all that is classic you know theater that is needed to manipulate [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=844.86s)]
*  someone like Donald Trump it works he has his own manipulations as well and as my as my colleague [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=851.94s)]
*  here said part of it is talking talking tough President Zelensky also is an entertainer and I [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=858.82s)]
*  think that tomorrow we're gonna see a little bit of that as well I'm sure he will come with his own [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=865.82s)]
*  bluster because he also has to return home and he has to not only get something from this visit [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=870.54s)]
*  but also show that they are not weak and that they can stand up to a Donald Trump and a and a [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=876.38s)]
*  and a Russian president in Putin so I think we're gonna see a lot of that there but yes I think it [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=883.9s)]
*  always makes a difference to be in person especially when you're dealing with Donald Trump he wanted to [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=889.3s)]
*  see a little bit of that yielding and Leon on that point of how these visits played domestically [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=894.26s)]
*  Joyce calling it political theater maybe it's political theater maybe it's statecraft how will [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=900.9s)]
*  this work for Keir Starmer back in the UK I think you'll be delighted I think the number 10 team [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=906.14s)]
*  around him will be over the moon it can't really have gone much better for Keir Starmer I mean you [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=912.86s)]
*  know there was a great deal of warmth between the two of them there was an agreement more or less on [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=918.7s)]
*  the controversial Tagos Islands deal there was talk of a trade deal between the UK and the US I [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=923.82s)]
*  think the only thing the only bit of a cloud on that visit was this was the the necessary security [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=930.5400000000001s)]
*  guarantees the backstop that Keir Starmer would have wanted perhaps something a little bit firmer [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=937.1s)]
*  but maybe Zelensky can get that over the line tomorrow so I think for Keir Starmer it went [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=941.74s)]
*  incredibly well he looked like the statesman he had that moment of JD Vance where they spoke about [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=946.94s)]
*  free speech in the UK and he was able to sort of shoot back at JD Vance and stand up for [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=952.54s)]
*  Britain's interests so I think he did very well and I think he'll be going home feeling pretty [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=958.46s)]
*  chuffed with himself [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgTaPPpOj-Y&t=963.26s)]
