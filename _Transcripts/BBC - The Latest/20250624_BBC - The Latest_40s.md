**BBC - The Latest:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9KxwcoOQPM)
*  We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9KxwcoOQPM&t=0.0s)]
*  don't know what the f*** they're doing. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9KxwcoOQPM&t=5.68s)]
*  You understand that? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9KxwcoOQPM&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  Israel as soon as we made the deal, they came out and they dropped a load of bombs, the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9KxwcoOQPM&t=10.6s)]
*  likes of which I'd never seen before. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9KxwcoOQPM&t=14.52s)]
*  The biggest load that we've seen. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9KxwcoOQPM&t=16.6s)]
*  I'm not happy with Israel. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9KxwcoOQPM&t=18.32s)]
*  You know, when I say, OK, now you have 12 hours, you don't go out in the first hour [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9KxwcoOQPM&t=20.2s)]
*  and just drop everything you have on them. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9KxwcoOQPM&t=24.96s)]
*  So I'm not happy with them. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9KxwcoOQPM&t=26.68s)]
*  I'm not happy with Iran either. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9KxwcoOQPM&t=28.36s)]
*  But I'm really unhappy if Israel is going out this morning because the one rocket that [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9KxwcoOQPM&t=30.28s)]
*  didn't land that was shot, perhaps by mistake, that didn't land. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9KxwcoOQPM&t=34.84s)]
*  I'm not happy about that. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9KxwcoOQPM&t=38.96s)]
