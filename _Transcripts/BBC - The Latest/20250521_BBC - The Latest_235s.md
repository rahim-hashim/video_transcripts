Video Description: Chris Brown has been freed on bail by a court in London after being charged with inflicting an "unprovoked attack" in a nightclub in 2023.

The US singer, who has not yet been asked to enter a plea in the case, is able to begin his world tour next month as planned as part of his bail conditions.

His tour is scheduled to start in Amsterdam on 8 June, with dates in Manchester, London, Cardiff, Birmingham and Glasgow later that month and in July.

He was arrested last week and later charged with grievous bodily harm over an incident in which he allegedly attacked a music producer with a tequila bottle at the Tape nightclub in London's Mayfair.

The musician had been held in custody since being arrested in Salford, Greater Manchester, last Thursday, and was initially refused bail on Friday.

*  US singer Chris Brown has been freed on bail by a court in London after being charged over [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_Dfrf8Nl3M&t=0.0s)]
*  an alleged assault in a nightclub in 2023. The court gave the American musician permission [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_Dfrf8Nl3M&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  to continue with his scheduled international tour, which includes UK shows in June and [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_Dfrf8Nl3M&t=10.34s)]
*  July. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_Dfrf8Nl3M&t=15.4s)]
*  Let's speak to our news correspondent Greg McKenzie, who's been following this story [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_Dfrf8Nl3M&t=16.4s)]
*  throughout. Greg, good to see you. What were the conditions of bail? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_Dfrf8Nl3M&t=19.76s)]
*  Well, there were strict conditions, Lucy, in terms of the bail that was granted today [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_Dfrf8Nl3M&t=23.2s)]
*  in a London court, Southwark Crown Court. Now, just in terms of background, Chris Brown [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_Dfrf8Nl3M&t=28.64s)]
*  was arrested last Thursday in Manchester in the early hours of the morning by Metropolitan [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_Dfrf8Nl3M&t=32.64s)]
*  Police officers who were tipped off that the singer had arrived in the UK. Now, he was [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_Dfrf8Nl3M&t=39.0s)]
*  wanted for questioning in relation to an assault in a nightclub two years ago in London. So [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_Dfrf8Nl3M&t=43.86s)]
*  the singer had flown in to Manchester on his private jet to work on preparations for his [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_Dfrf8Nl3M&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  tour. He has a number of UK dates. And it was then that the police arrested him last [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_Dfrf8Nl3M&t=57.92s)]
*  Thursday at two o'clock in the morning. He went to court the following morning and the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_Dfrf8Nl3M&t=63.56s)]
*  judge said that he was not going to grant the singer bail. And he was subsequently held [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_Dfrf8Nl3M&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  on remand in a UK prison, we believe in a Manchester prison. Now, today, his lawyers [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_Dfrf8Nl3M&t=74.84s)]
*  have submitted successfully a bail application and the judge at Southwark Crown Court has [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_Dfrf8Nl3M&t=80.92s)]
*  granted that bail for the singer on the condition that the singer pays £4 million up front [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_Dfrf8Nl3M&t=86.84s)]
*  and a further £1 million in the next week. Now, that is really a security deposit, if [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_Dfrf8Nl3M&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  you like, so that if the singer breaks any of the conditions of that bail condition, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_Dfrf8Nl3M&t=100.80000000000001s)]
*  then he would forfeit the £5 million in total. Now, as for other conditions that have been [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_Dfrf8Nl3M&t=105.68s)]
*  The judge has said that he will allow Chris Brown to carry on with his UK tour date. So [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_Dfrf8Nl3M&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  he's due in Manchester, London, Cardiff, Birmingham and Glasgow, and also other dates in the US [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_Dfrf8Nl3M&t=118.72s)]
*  and Canada. The judge has said he will allow the singer to travel internationally, but [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_Dfrf8Nl3M&t=126.2s)]
*  he must provide an address here in the UK where he must reside until his next court [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_Dfrf8Nl3M&t=132.96s)]
*  appearance on June 20. And briefly, Greg, we're seeing pictures of Chris Brown at the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_Dfrf8Nl3M&t=138.96s)]
*  moment on tour. He's won a few Grammys. Tell us a bit more about his career and why he's [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_Dfrf8Nl3M&t=143.88s)]
*  so popular. Well, Chris Brown is an international platinum selling artist. He's had numbers [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_Dfrf8Nl3M&t=149.48000000000002s)]
*  and numbers and number one hits and an artist that has been in the industry for a number [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_Dfrf8Nl3M&t=156.56s)]
*  of decades and many people have watched him grow from a child to a man and be quite successful. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_Dfrf8Nl3M&t=161.76000000000002s)]
*  He's had a few issues in the past, which were widely reported, most famously the incident [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_Dfrf8Nl3M&t=168.36s)]
*  with Rihanna back in 2010. And subsequently, he had spent some time, had got prosecuted [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_Dfrf8Nl3M&t=174.96s)]
*  for that back in Los Angeles many, many years ago. But moving forward, the singer had apologised [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_Dfrf8Nl3M&t=183.96s)]
*  and has seemed to be getting his life back on track. And this incident two years ago, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_Dfrf8Nl3M&t=189.72000000000003s)]
*  he's yet to answer to those charges or even enter a plea. But it's widely expected on [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_Dfrf8Nl3M&t=195.36s)]
*  June the 20th when he appears at Southwark Crown Court that he will submit a plea and [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_Dfrf8Nl3M&t=201.12s)]
*  he will appear in court on the 20th of June, along with his co-defendant Omolulu Akinlulu, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_Dfrf8Nl3M&t=208.92000000000002s)]
*  who is a music producer. Both the pair, well, the pair are accused of attacking a fellow [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_Dfrf8Nl3M&t=216.56s)]
*  music producer at a London nightclub two years ago. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_Dfrf8Nl3M&t=221.68s)]
*  Greg, thank you so much. Good to see you. Greg McKenzie, who has been following this [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_Dfrf8Nl3M&t=226.8s)]
