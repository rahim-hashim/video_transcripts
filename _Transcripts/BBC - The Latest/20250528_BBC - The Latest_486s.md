Video Description: The EU's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, has said that "Israeli strikes in Gaza go beyond what is necessary to fight Hamas" as the death toll there continues to mount.
 
Israeli air strikes and other military actions since it resumed the war in March following a ceasefire have killed 3,924 people, the Hamas-run health ministry said. 
 
Israel said it is acting to destroy Hamas and get back hostages the group holds.
 
Kallas also said that the EU did not support a new aid distribution model backed by the US and Israel which bypasses the UN and other humanitarian organisations.

# EU says Israeli strikes in Gaza 'go beyond what is necessary' to fight Hamas | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM)
*  Let's turn back to the Middle East now and the EU's top diplomat, Kaya Kala, says [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel's military strikes on Gaza go beyond what is necessary to defeat [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=6.08s)]
*  Hamas. She's also criticized the new aid distribution system imposed by Israel [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=10.74s)]
*  in Gaza which bypasses the United Nations. Let me just actually quickly [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=16.2s)]
*  take you back to the UN because the Security Council has been meeting and is [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=21.32s)]
*  meeting to discuss the situation in Gaza. We've been hearing some of the key [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  contributions in the last hour or so and we'll return there in the next few [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=29.04s)]
*  minutes to get the latest live but I also want to just play you a little more [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=33.28s)]
*  of what Kaya Kala has been saying today. Israel's strikes in Gaza go [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=37.28s)]
*  beyond what is necessary to fight Hamas. Humanitarian aid cannot be weaponized, it [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=44.32s)]
*  has to be in accordance with the humanitarian principles and therefore we [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=51.92s)]
*  have the humanitarian aid organizations that are able to provide that aid. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=57.24s)]
*  Well that UN session started with Sigrid Karg who is the UN special coordinator [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=64.84s)]
*  for the Middle East peace process talking and introducing today's session. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  She said the entire population of Gaza is facing the risk of famine. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=74.4s)]
*  The people in Gaza have lost hope Mr. President. Instead of saying goodbye, see you tomorrow, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=81.8s)]
*  Palestinians now say see you in heaven. Death is their companion. It's not life, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=87.76s)]
*  it is not hope. Palestinians in Gaza deserve more than survival. They deserve [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=96.92s)]
*  a viable and vibrant future. Well we'll return to the Security Council in the [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=104.88s)]
*  next few minutes but let's speak now to our correspondent Barbara Plett-Asher [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=110.28s)]
*  who's in Jerusalem for us and Barbara I hope you can hear me okay but people [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=114.12s)]
*  there are marking the 600th day of this war in Gaza. Give me an idea of the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=120.28s)]
*  sorts of things that they have been saying to you. Yes Matthew I'm actually [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=126.44s)]
*  in central Tel Aviv in hostage square a place from where we've reported many [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=132.96s)]
*  times so I think it's familiar to viewers this is a place that became a [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=137.48s)]
*  central gathering point for the families and friends of hostages shortly after [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=140.92s)]
*  the war began and I don't think anyone expected they would still be here 600 [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=144.72s)]
*  days later you can see the countdown there 599 leading up to 600 days. They [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=149.56s)]
*  are very frustrated they are very angry many of them very angry with the Prime [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=155.04s)]
*  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who they believe ended the ceasefire in March and [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=159.04s)]
*  resumed the war because for political reasons because of pressure from his [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=164.28s)]
*  hardline cabinet partners and they're very afraid that these airstrikes that [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=168.88s)]
*  have been killing Palestinians will kill their loved ones the ones that are still [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=174.32s)]
*  there so quite a lot of criticism of the Prime Minister also appeals to President [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=177.56s)]
*  Trump because the Americans have ended up negotiating directly with Hamas to [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=182.08s)]
*  get an American hostage freed and so they're saying Mr. Trump please take the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=186.84s)]
*  lead here and get all the rest of the hostages back so very much a sense of [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=190.92s)]
*  frustration at this 600 day mark and they have been Matthew the sharp end of [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=195.72s)]
*  the spear for protests against the war but polls show that a majority of [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=200.51999999999998s)]
*  Israelis want the war to end in the hostages to come back you have had in [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=204.44s)]
*  recent days and weeks much sharper criticism so the former Prime Minister [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=208.67999999999998s)]
*  Ahud Omert who has been critical of Israel's tactics in Gaza the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=213.48s)]
*  humanitarian crisis the deaths the civilian deaths has now actually said he [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=218.12s)]
*  believes that they are war crimes that is still very much a minority view in [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=222.88s)]
*  Israel but it does show you how the the war having gone on for so long and then [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=228.20000000000002s)]

*  me the situation in Gaza Strip is devastating and getting worse and worse [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=265.44s)]
*  after almost 12 weeks of complete blockade even with the very few amount [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=269.8s)]
*  of trucks that entered Gaza Strip recently it's it's not enough it didn't [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=275.76s)]
*  reach the people at household level or family level so people in Gaza Strip 2 [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=280.36s)]
*  million people are starving living at risk of famine and they ran out mechanism [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=287.98s)]
*  and yet they have to face the mass the forced mass displacement and evacuation [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=297.56s)]
*  in addition to the intensifying air strikes all over Gaza Strip so people are [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=305.16s)]
*  fleeing and wandering the streets with no access to shelter items with no access to food [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=313.88s)]
*  with no access to hygiene most organized almost all organization humanitarian [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=320.92s)]
*  organizations in Gaza Strip ran out or have zero stock of humanitarian aids so [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=326.04s)]
*  the situation in Gaza Strip is catastrophic we were just listening to [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=332.68s)]
*  the UN special coordinator for the Middle East peace process talking at the [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=338.0s)]
*  UN Security Council and she said and just recounted some of the conversations [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=341.84000000000003s)]
*  she'd heard that instead of saying see you tomorrow Garzans are saying see you [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=346.84000000000003s)]
*  in heaven and she said a phrase death is their companion is that the sort of [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=351.2s)]
*  thing that you are hearing from people when you talk to people yes it's all [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=356.59999999999997s)]
*  all it's all over around everyone all kind of fears all kind of killing like [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=361.2s)]
*  some people who especially children as analysis showed more than 71,000 children [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=367.8s)]
*  are having acute malnutrition so they with this starvation with this very limited access to [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=377.12s)]
*  very limited items of food they are starving to death in addition to air strikes everywhere [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=387.64000000000004s)]
*  for example me myself as a humanitarian aid workers for during the last recent month I [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=394.36s)]
*  escaped from here and there like three times worrying about my children while they are at [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=402.96s)]
*  a final question if I could and I hope the line will restore because it looks like it might have [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=409.68s)]
*  frozen no it's come back we know of the new humanitarian arrangements that Israel has set [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=419.32s)]
*  a lot of condemnation of that from the UN but are you finding that are people where you are [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=427.8s)]
*  heading south towards that aid or are they not are they staying put it's it's not that this [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=434.59999999999997s)]
*  mechanism is not designed to be reachable especially for people in Gaza and north in [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=441.64s)]
*  Gaza City and north so I know the people who ran out ran for receiving some aids or taking some [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=447.96s)]
*  aids are from a Malasi which is a very southern part of Gaza Strip but for north and Gaza City [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=456.04s)]
*  it's not workable it's not applicable for them to go there because it takes hours of walking or [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=465.40000000000003s)]
*  using donkey carts so it's not visible it's not workable and the mechanism itself is not designed [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=471.16s)]
*  to reach people in Gaza and north you're sorry we have to leave it there thank you for joining us [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoaKBr7d9LM&t=478.28000000000003s)]
