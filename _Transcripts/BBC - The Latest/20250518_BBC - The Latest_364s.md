# Pope Leo XVI's inauguration Mass takes place at Vatican | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w)
*  Well, Pope Leo XIV has formally taken up his role as leader of the Catholic Church with [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=0.0s)]
*  an inaugural mass in St Peter's Square. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  The Pope arrived in an open-topped Pope mobile, smiling and waving at the huge crowds who'd [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=9.72s)]
*  lined the streets there. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  The ceremonies began with prayers at the tomb of St Peter inside the Basilica, with the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=16.96s)]
*  mass being celebrated in the square outside. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=21.64s)]
*  A palium garment, a white wooden band, was placed on the Pope's shoulders and fixed in [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=24.6s)]
*  place with three pins to represent the nails on the cross. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=29.64s)]
*  Then, the ring of the fisherman was placed on the Pope's finger. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=33.44s)]
*  It's a symbol of the papacy which bears an image of St Peter. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=37.08s)]
*  Pope Leo then took the book of the Gospels to bless the people. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=41.52s)]
*  In his homily, the Pope condemns systems which exploit the earth and marginalise the poor. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=45.32s)]
*  He also stressed the need for unity in the Church and highlighted the importance of its [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=51.28s)]
*  traditions in confronting new challenges. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=55.08s)]
*  Brothers and sisters, I greet all of you with a heart full of gratitude at the beginning [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=58.96s)]
*  of the ministry that has been entrusted to me. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=67.64s)]
*  In this our time, we still see too much discord, too many wounds caused by hatred, violence, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=71.44s)]
*  prejudice, the fear of difference, and an economic paradigm that exploits the earth's [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=78.76s)]
*  resources and marginalises the poorest. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=86.2s)]
*  For our part, we want to be a small leaven of unity, communion and fraternity within [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=89.2s)]
*  the world. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=98.64s)]
*  Let's speak to our correspondent Beth Nibel who is at the Vatican. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=99.64s)]
*  So, a very important day, lots of symbolism there. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=106.0s)]
*  Just tell us what it was like to be there. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=109.47999999999999s)]
*  It was a day really of a lot of emotion, excitement, joy, solemn emotion. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=112.36s)]
*  And really the moment that stood out for me right at the beginning was when the Pope came [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=119.84s)]
*  through St Peter's Square in his Pope mobile waving at the people and there were these [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=125.2s)]
*  big cheers, applause for the Pope. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=130.12s)]
*  People were lifting up their babies to him to bless. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=134.0s)]
*  He came all the way down the street where I am now and back again before he went into [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=137.56s)]
*  the Basilica to pray at the tomb of the first Pope, the Apostle Peter. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=143.0s)]
*  And the links between Pope Leo and the first Pope Peter have been constantly a theme today. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=148.56s)]
*  We saw that with the dedication of the fisherman's ring, the papal ring, which has St Peter engraved [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=156.52s)]
*  on the outside, has Pope Leo's name on the inside. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=162.68s)]
*  And it's a solemn moment that the Pope appeared visibly moved when the ring was placed on [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=166.48s)]
*  his finger. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=172.0s)]
*  And this is, each Pope gets their own ring and originally these were used as signet rings [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=173.44s)]
*  in the past to seal important documents. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=179.95999999999998s)]
*  That's not done these days but now it is still the case that when a Pope dies his signet [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=183.51999999999998s)]
*  ring is destroyed. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=188.64s)]
*  So this is something very particular for each Pope. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=189.64s)]
*  I felt a lot of emotion here in the Square, people telling me that they had come here [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=192.56s)]
*  because they felt it was an important occasion that they liked the Pope's message of peace, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=197.32000000000002s)]
*  which he reiterated a number of times today during the service. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=203.12s)]
*  Bethany, just tell us a little bit about who was in attendance, some significant world [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=207.12s)]
*  leaders there. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=212.36s)]
*  And we're just hearing that the US Vice President JD Vance has met with President Zelensky in [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=213.36s)]
*  Rome because of course they were two of the assembled crowd. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=220.32s)]
*  Yes, there was an enormous delegation of world leaders, kings and queens. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=223.32s)]
*  We were told 156 delegations in all. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=231.32s)]
*  And as you mentioned, the Vice President of the United States JD Vance was there with [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=234.39999999999998s)]
*  his wife, also the Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=239.64s)]
*  Now, and before the service began, they briefly shook hands. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=243.11999999999998s)]
*  We understand that may be the first time that's happened since their encounter in the White [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=248.62s)]
*  House. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=252.56s)]
*  And after the service, there was this very big meet and greet, if you like, where a lot [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=253.56s)]
*  of the delegations went inside St Peter's Basilica, shook hands with the Pope. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=258.40000000000003s)]
*  And the Vatican has been suggesting over recent days that they see this place as a place for [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=264.36s)]
*  reconciliation, for steps in which to try and foster peace. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=270.2s)]
*  And it was interesting to note that at the end of the service, the Pope said that it [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=275.72s)]
*  was important in this moment of joy and celebration to remember not only the poor, but the people [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=280.82s)]
*  who were in countries that were torn apart by war. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=287.3s)]
*  And he specifically mentioned Gaza, Myanmar and Ukraine. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=290.5s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=295.02s)]
*  Bethany Bell in the Vatican for us. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=296.02s)]
*  And what you can see on the screens there, we'll just show you again, are images of Pope [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=297.74s)]

*  These pictures have just come into us. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=307.06s)]
*  And we're also hearing that the vice president, J.D. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=309.38s)]
*  Matt Vance, has also met the Ukrainian president. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=312.3s)]
*  Of course, a lot of politics for the pair to discuss as President Trump tomorrow is [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=316.46000000000004s)]
*  set to talk to Presidents Putin and indeed Zelensky on the phone as the U.S. administration [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=322.54s)]
*  tries to restart those efforts for a ceasefire in Ukraine. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=330.34s)]
*  They appear to have stalled a little bit. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=335.14s)]
*  So these are the latest pictures coming into us. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=336.62s)]
*  They show Pope Leo with Vladimir Zelensky there on a monumental day, of course, the [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=339.14s)]
*  day of Pope Leo's inauguration. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEFwUA8rt6w&t=345.9s)]
