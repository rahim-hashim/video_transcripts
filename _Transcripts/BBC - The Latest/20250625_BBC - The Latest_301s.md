# BBC reports from Iran on ceasefire deal with Israel | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA)
*  Let's return to what we heard from Donald Trump a little earlier. He has rejected a leaked US intelligence report that casts doubt [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=0.0s)]
*  over the success of America's strikes on Iran. I'll talk about that in more detail with Gordon Carrera, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=7.36s)]
*  the BBC's former security correspondent here in a moment. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=13.84s)]
*  But Donald Trump also saying at that news briefing that the US and Iran would be meeting at some stage next week. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=16.72s)]
*  So let's head to Tel Aviv and to our correspondent Mark Lowen who's there for us. And Mark, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=23.6s)]
*  that was very interesting. Donald Trump very open about talks and a meeting with Iran next week. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=29.84s)]
*  He said we'll be asking for what we asked before which was no nuclear. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=36.4s)]
*  So your reading of that? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=42.160000000000004s)]
*  I have to say Matthew, there's been no confirmation that we can see at the moment from the Iranian authorities of that meeting. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=45.04s)]
*  Steve Witkoff, Donald Trump's envoy in chief for all the crises in the world it seems, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=51.2s)]
*  apparently is having sort of indirect and [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=57.04s)]
*  talks with Tehran. But there's been no official word that we have got so far from Iran [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=59.919999999999995s)]
*  corroborating that comment from Donald Trump. But clearly there is so little trust from the Iranian side now, both in Israel and in America. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=64.62s)]
*  Having seen [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=73.19999999999999s)]
*  Trump's comment that there was going to be a two-week [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  window for diplomacy as perhaps some kind of decoy or ruse before American bombers came in. And of course two days before [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=77.75999999999999s)]
*  the US and Iran were due to sit down for a sixth round of nuclear negotiations, the Israeli bombing began. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=85.68s)]
*  So I think that it's going to be probably quite difficult to get the Iranians back around the negotiating table. And on top of that, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=91.76s)]
*  you've got to bear in mind Matthew that [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=99.68s)]
*  for so long, for decades, the nuclear programme has been a symbol of independence and sovereignty for the Iranians. Also [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=102.16s)]
*  a negotiating tool with the West. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=109.36s)]
*  So, you know, if Donald Trump is kind of triumphantly saying that actually that programme has been destroyed, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=111.6s)]
*  well, how much are the Iranians going to want to talk [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=116.88s)]
*  to the Americans at the moment, you know, having been so incredibly damaged by what has happened? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=120.08s)]
*  I mean, our chief international correspondent, Lise Doucet, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=125.28s)]
*  has sent this report after crossing the border into Iran. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=128.48s)]
*  She is allowed to report from there on condition that none of her reports are used on the BBC's Persian service. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=132.72s)]
*  This law from Iranian authorities applies to all international media agencies operating in Iran. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  Day two of the ceasefire and despite its shaky start, it seems to be holding and traffic is [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=146.72s)]
*  starting to return to the streets of Tehran. The city is starting to look like itself, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=152.4s)]
*  but so many of the cafes, the shops, the government offices are still shut. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=158.32000000000002s)]
*  So many residents fled this city once Israeli attacks started. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=163.76000000000002s)]
*  And they seem to be waiting until the end of the Iranian weekend, which starts tomorrow, to see whether it truly holds. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=168.16s)]
*  But some rhythms of life are returning. The internet [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=175.52s)]
*  is coming back and with it the social media platforms are filling up with strongly worded posts. Some Iranians praising their government, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=178.72s)]
*  others protesting. And this kind of conversation in private and public is certain to intensify. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=186.72s)]
*  What happens outside also matters too. Most of all in Washington with President Trump, but across this region too and far beyond. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=193.52s)]
*  As enormously relieved as Iranians are that there is a ceasefire, many are also asking how long will it last? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=202.32s)]
*  A rare report from inside Tehran there by Lise Doucet, our chief international correspondent. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=211.6s)]
*  But Matthew, while the glare over the last 12 days has been on the Iran conflict, let's not forget [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=217.04s)]
*  what is also happening in the other war that Israel is fighting against Hamas in Gaza, where the situation is continuing to deteriorate on a daily basis. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=222.72s)]
*  Over the 12 days of the Iran-Israel war, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=231.12s)]
*  868 people have been killed in Gaza by Israeli fire, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=235.18s)]
*  many of them while queuing for aid. The situation on the ground, absolutely catastrophic, and that mechanism set up by the US and Israel to deliver aid, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=239.68s)]
*  called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, has been labelled constantly a death trap. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=248.95999999999998s)]
*  Also, the casualties amounting on the Israeli side. In the last 24 hours, seven Israeli soldiers were killed [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=253.6s)]
*  by an improvised explosive device blowing up their armoured vehicle inside Gaza, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=261.52s)]
*  and that takes the total number of Israeli soldiers killed since the ground offensive against Hamas in Gaza began to 440. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=266.15999999999997s)]
*  The big question is whether the ceasefire in Iran provides some kind of momentum now, some kind of renewed opportunity for the Israeli [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=273.44s)]
*  government to seek to rein in the war in Gaza and seek a solution there. That is a very, very big question. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=281.04s)]
*  Donald Trump said that he believes that there will be good news from Gaza in the next few weeks, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=288.56s)]
*  but then again, he did say that the Ukraine war would end within 24 hours when he took office. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=292.8s)]
*  Absolutely. Mark, there in Tel Aviv, thanks very much. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmNqOq_vUA&t=297.68s)]
