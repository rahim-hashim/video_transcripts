Video Description: Donald Trump's decision to impose new tariffs on all goods entering the US is a "major blow to the world economy", European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen has said.
 
Her comments echo those of a number of other countries, including China, which has expressed its opposition to the move and has warned it will take "resolute countermeasures" against the US.
 
Their words of warning come after the US president announced a universal 10% tariff on all imports into the US from 5 April. Around 60 countries will also be hit with steeper tariffs from 9 April.
 
Trump has said the tariffs will be used to boost US manufacturing, saying on Wednesday that the move would "make America wealthy again".

# World leaders criticise Trump tariffs as 'major blow' | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [April 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ)
*  In a significant moment for global trade, Donald Trump's announced sweeping new taxes on imports [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=0.0s)]
*  from around the world. The president said that America had been ripped off by foreigners for [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=6.08s)]
*  decades. He signed the executive order in the White House Rose Garden and described it as [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=12.08s)]
*  Liberation Day. So let's look at some of the headline figures. There'll be a universal baseline [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=18.32s)]
*  tariff of 10% on all imports coming into the U.S. Now that's the rate that will be imposed on the UK. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=23.68s)]
*  The European Union has been hit with a higher 20% tariff and he imposed an additional 34% [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=32.32s)]
*  tariff on China. That's on top of the 20% tariffs already announced. Well, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=39.2s)]
*  our North America correspondent David Willis begins our coverage. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=45.04s)]
*  This is one of the most important days in my opinion in American history. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=48.0s)]
*  It's our declaration of economic independence. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=56.16s)]
*  In the scented surroundings of the White House Rose Garden, President Trump told his audience [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=60.16s)]
*  the United States had been looted, raped and pillaged by nations near and far. No longer. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=65.52s)]
*  So if you look at that, China first row. Like a bookie offering odds at a horse race, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=72.72s)]
*  the president listed tariffs ranging from a baseline of 10% which the UK will have to pay [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=79.68s)]
*  to reciprocal taxes on countries that have measures in place to keep U.S. products out of [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=86.0s)]
*  their markets. 20% on goods from EU nations, 24% on products from Japan, all the way to tariffs of [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=91.68s)]
*  54% on imports from America's biggest trading partner, China. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=101.52s)]
*  The United Kingdom 10% and we'll go 10%. So we'll do the same thing. Reciprocal. That means they do [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=107.12s)]
*  it to us and we do it to them. Very simple. Can't get any simpler than that. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=115.6s)]
*  For nations that treat us badly, we will calculate the combined rate of all their tariffs, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=123.92s)]
*  non-monetary barriers and other forms of cheating. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=128.96s)]
*  Car dealers reported a rush to buy motor vehicles ahead of a separate 25% tariff on foreign imports, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=133.28s)]
*  which came into effect overnight. President Trump believes that, combined, these measures will [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=140.72s)]
*  boost American manufacturing and, in his words, make America wealthy again. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=146.88s)]
*  And given the threat of retaliation from other nations, does this mark the start of a global [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=151.92s)]
*  trade war? David Willis, BBC News. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=168.32s)]
*  Well, Sakir Starmer has been reacting to the tariffs imposed on the UK. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=172.88s)]
*  We have to understand that, just as with defence and security, so too for the economy and trade. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=177.52s)]
*  We are living in a changing world, entering a new era. We must rise to this challenge, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=186.4s)]
*  and that is why I've instructed my team to move further and faster on the changes I believe [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=194.56s)]
*  will make our economy stronger and more resilient. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  Because this government will do everything necessary to defend the UK's national interest. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=205.36s)]
*  We'll be with our UK political correspondent shortly, but let's focus in on China because [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=211.20000000000002s)]
*  China has promised resolute countermeasures against the moves against its country, saying [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=215.44000000000003s)]
*  that it is maintaining communication with the US over trade. So let's cross over to Beijing, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=220.72000000000003s)]
*  our China correspondent, Stephen MacDonald joins us live now. China being hit very much the hardest [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=225.36s)]
*  when it comes to all of these different levies. Yes, well, this latest round of tariffs from [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=231.76s)]
*  Donald Trump is a typical act of unilateral bullying, according to the Chinese government. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=239.2s)]
*  Tough words from Beijing after this latest round of tariffs was placed on Chinese goods. Now, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=246.32s)]
*  if you add them all up, we're up to now 54 percent, the tariffs on Chinese goods going into the US. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=252.23999999999998s)]
*  Of course, that's going to hurt Chinese companies wanting to sell into the American market. But Beijing [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=258.88s)]
*  has promised its own resolute countermeasures. Now, we don't know what they are, but it doesn't sound [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=264.64s)]
*  like nothing. Of course, when these countermeasures come in, that's going to hit US companies wanting [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=269.92s)]
*  to sell into the huge Chinese market. And, you know, again, when you look at the language coming [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=275.84s)]
*  out of the government here, the Commerce Ministry put out a statement today that the Chinese [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=282.15999999999997s)]
*  Commerce Ministry put out a statement today attacking the very idea that this was somehow [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=287.04s)]
*  reciprocal. I'll just give you the quote. The so-called reciprocal tariffs are based on the US's [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=292.48s)]
*  unilateral and subjective assessments. So they're just making fun of the whole idea that this is a [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=299.68s)]
*  provocation which has been foisted upon the US government. And what's going to be interesting [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=305.76s)]
*  now, though, is to see the extent to which trade patterns might alter, might that huge block of [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=312.96s)]
*  Europe and China ban together other countries, cutting the US out of the loop that would further [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=319.59999999999997s)]
*  hurt the US economy. But all this is to be played out in the months ahead. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=325.59999999999997s)]
*  Stephen, as always, many thanks. Stephen MacDonald there joining us from Beijing. Thank you. So that [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=330.4s)]
*  was the reaction from China. We know also that the EU was hit hard with 20 percent levies. The [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=334.96s)]
*  European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen described the US tariffs as a major blow to the [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=341.12s)]
*  world economy. She said the EU had always been ready to negotiate with the US to remove barriers [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=346.08s)]
*  to transatlantic trade. President Trump's announcement of universal tariffs on the whole [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=351.6s)]
*  world, including the European Union, is a major blow to the world economy. I deeply regret this [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=358.4s)]
*  choice. Let's be clear-eyed about the immense consequences. The global economy will massively [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=366.64s)]
*  suffer. Uncertainty will spiral and trigger the rise of further protectionism. The consequences [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=374.32s)]
*  will be dire for millions of people around the globe, also for the most vulnerable countries, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=382.56s)]
*  which are now subject to some of the highest US tariffs. So a stark warning there. Let's cross [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=390.88000000000005s)]
*  over to Berlin because our correspondent Rupert Wingfield-Hayes joins us now. And it feels like [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=397.04s)]
*  Ursula von der Leyen has always been talking about retaliation on the part of the EU, but now there [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=402.16s)]
*  is a willingness to negotiate. A bit of a change of tune there. Well, Europe is not in a strong [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=407.68s)]
*  position, Cassia, when you look at this situation that has emerged overnight. Europe has a huge [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=413.36s)]
*  trade surplus with the United States, around a quarter of a trillion dollars a year. And European [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=419.68s)]
*  exporters, particularly here in Europe's biggest economy, Germany, are very, very dependent on the [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=425.68s)]
*  United States market. I mean, I saw one statistic this morning that one in every four cars produced [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=431.76s)]
*  by the Porsche company here in Germany is sold to the United States. And Germany's car industry is [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=437.92s)]
*  very, very important to the German economy. So what to do? I mean, a trade war would be bad [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=444.88s)]
*  for everybody. So it's understandable that Ursula von der Leyen's first response is to look for [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=450.4s)]
*  negotiations. And while she says there's a package of measures that have been put in place if [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=455.28s)]
*  negotiations fail, it's very, very clear from the very gloomy mood here in Europe that the first, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=460.0s)]
*  the initial hope is that there can be a negotiated way out of these tariffs. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=467.6s)]
*  Rupert, as always, thank you. Rupert Wingfield-Hayes with The View from the EU. Now we heard [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=473.28000000000003s)]
*  what Sakir Starmer was saying a little bit earlier on. Let's get a little bit more on that with our [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=478.64000000000004s)]
*  chief political correspondent Henry Zefman, who joins us live outside Downing Street. Henry, so [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=483.12s)]
*  just bring us up to date because there is scope. The UK is still in negotiations. There is hope of [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=488.56s)]
*  a potential negotiation, a potential some sort of deal. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=494.96000000000004s)]
*  That's right. And that's why the Prime Minister has been urging calm this morning. He had a dozen [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=498.8s)]
*  or so leaders of some of the biggest businesses in this country into Downing Street, first thing [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=504.96s)]
*  this morning, to really try to reassure them that he is doing all he can to mitigate the impact of [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=509.84s)]
*  these tariffs. So domestically, he talked about making the UK economy more resilient, but I think [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=516.16s)]
*  it's the international sphere that's most important. He is still talking about how the [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=521.76s)]
*  most important. He is still talking about trying to secure that deal with the US, an economic [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=526.16s)]
*  agreement which would span all sorts of things, including technology and agriculture and goods, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=531.8399999999999s)]
*  but would mean the reduction, perhaps even the dismantling altogether of these tariffs. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=536.0s)]
*  What people I speak to in government, though, have no handle on whatsoever is whether President Trump [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=541.68s)]
*  himself agrees with and is willing to sign, and over what timeframe he might be willing to sign, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=547.28s)]
*  that deal which his own team have been negotiating with the UK. If he does sign that deal, great, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=554.16s)]
*  although clearly still the UK would be affected by the ruptures in the global economy. But if he [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=559.92s)]
*  doesn't sign that deal, then I think you will see more pressure building here in the UK for Sarkis [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=565.76s)]
*  Dahmer to retaliate. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G9RhpwIhlQ&t=571.12s)]
