Video Description: Spain's former football federation boss Luis Rubiales has been found guilty of sexual assault for kissing player Jenni Hermoso without her consent and ordered to pay a fine of â‚¬10,800.
 
He was acquitted of coercion, for allegedly trying to pressure Hermoso into saying publicly that the kiss was consensual.
 
As Spain's players received their medals after defeating England in Sydney to win the 2023 World Cup, Rubiales grabbed Hermoso by the head and kissed her on the lips.
 
The ruling also banned Rubiales from going within a 200-meter radius of Hermoso and from communicating with her for one year, the court said in a statement.

**BBC - The Latest:** [February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIs9v29bcg)
*  Welcome back. We've been bringing you some news from Madrid in the last hour that the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIs9v29bcg&t=0.0s)]
*  High Court has found former Football Federation Chief Luis Robiales guilty of kissing a player [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIs9v29bcg&t=4.32s)]
*  without her consent after the Women's World Cup final. He's been fined more than $10,000 [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIs9v29bcg&t=10.76s)]
*  but acquitted of coercion. Mr Robiales told the court last week that Jenny Hermoso had [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIs9v29bcg&t=15.8s)]
*  given him permission to kiss her during what he described as a spontaneous moment at the [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIs9v29bcg&t=20.76s)]
*  World Cup. With me is our reporter, Sergi Forcara. You were in Madrid at the time this [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIs9v29bcg&t=26.0s)]
*  all blew up. So you've been looking up the comments from the judge in the court. What [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIs9v29bcg&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  has he said? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIs9v29bcg&t=38.4s)]
*  Yeah, very long sentencing, so still reading through it. But basically what he says is [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIs9v29bcg&t=39.4s)]
*  that he gives full credibility to what Jennifer Hermoso said in court last week or a couple [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIs9v29bcg&t=43.2s)]
*  of weeks ago in Madrid. He says, the judge says that kissing on the lips is not something [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIs9v29bcg&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  that you do with a regular player, with someone that you don't have a close relationship with. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIs9v29bcg&t=54.92s)]
*  And he sees a clear sexual connotation in the case of Mr Robiales kissing Jennifer Hermoso. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIs9v29bcg&t=61.0s)]
*  Has there been reaction from the government to this? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIs9v29bcg&t=68.12s)]
*  Yeah, plenty of reaction in Madrid and across Spain because obviously this was highly followed [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIs9v29bcg&t=71.08000000000001s)]
*  in August 2023 and even the trial last week. The Quality Minister from the Spanish government [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIs9v29bcg&t=76.68s)]
*  has said that this sentencing proves that without consent we're talking about the sexual [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIs9v29bcg&t=82.92s)]
*  aggression. So she kind of welcomes this sentencing to prove that in this case there wasn't consent, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIs9v29bcg&t=88.72s)]
*  which is obviously what Jennifer Hermoso has always maintained. On the other hand, obviously [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIs9v29bcg&t=96.96s)]
*  Luis Rubiales had always said that he asked Jennifer Hermoso something that according [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIs9v29bcg&t=102.24s)]
*  to the judge was not able to be proved during the trial. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIs9v29bcg&t=109.55999999999999s)]
*  He was acquitted of coercion. Talk to me about that and what had gone on before the trial. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIs9v29bcg&t=113.8s)]
*  Yeah, so there were basically two charges here. One was whether he was guilty of sexual [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIs9v29bcg&t=119.0s)]
*  aggression for the kiss, but also coercion because here it's not only about that moment, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIs9v29bcg&t=125.58s)]
*  but what happened after, the fallout after the kiss. So Jennifer Hermoso said that she [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIs9v29bcg&t=131.56s)]
*  had been pressured, that at some point she was asked to make a video statement with [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIs9v29bcg&t=135.7s)]
*  Mr. Rubiales. The judge here doesn't seem to agree with the whole debate about whether [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIs9v29bcg&t=141.45999999999998s)]
*  there was coercion or not. Both Mr. Rubiales and other people that were also being trialed [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIs9v29bcg&t=149.94s)]
*  for this have been acquitted for this because the judge was saying that while he didn't [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIs9v29bcg&t=154.89999999999998s)]
*  ask for consent, he didn't see any violence or anything that would reach the bar of coercion. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIs9v29bcg&t=162.9s)]
*  What about the reaction to the sentence? A 10,000 euro fine, but he's been spared jail. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIs9v29bcg&t=170.5s)]
*  Is that, did the Spanish public think that is an adequate sentence? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIs9v29bcg&t=176.26s)]
*  Well here, obviously it depends on who you ask. We haven't heard from the lawyers for [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIs9v29bcg&t=181.46s)]
*  Mr. Rubiales yet, but obviously for him he's being sentenced for sexual assault, but he's [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIs9v29bcg&t=187.18s)]
*  not going to jail. Remember that the public prosecutor was asking for up to two years [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIs9v29bcg&t=194.78s)]
*  and a half of jail, so in a way he's not going there so it can be a bittersweet victory, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIs9v29bcg&t=199.7s)]
*  but in any case this can be appealed now, so it can go to a higher court, so maybe it's [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIs9v29bcg&t=207.14s)]
*  probably not the end of the story. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIs9v29bcg&t=213.74s)]
*  Quickly, any reaction from Jenny Almaso? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIs9v29bcg&t=215.26s)]
*  Not by now, not her or either any of the other players from the Spanish team. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIs9v29bcg&t=217.54s)]
*  We'll bring you that as and when we get it, I'm no doubt she will comment at some point today. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIs9v29bcg&t=221.85999999999999s)]
*  Sergi, thank you very much. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PIs9v29bcg&t=225.85999999999999s)]
