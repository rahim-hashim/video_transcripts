# Deadly new Russian drone and missile attack hits Kyiv | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuqJrcplOoQ)
*  Some breaking news from Ukraine. Kiev commander renewed Russian drone and missile attacks overnight, killing at least two people and injuring 13. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuqJrcplOoQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Several residential and other buildings were set on fire by falling debris. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuqJrcplOoQ&t=9.0s)]
*  Let's cross live now to Kiev and speak to our diplomatic correspondent, Paul Adams, who's there for us. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuqJrcplOoQ&t=14.0s)]
*  Paul, a second night in a row of deadly attacks from Russia. How bad was the one overnight? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuqJrcplOoQ&t=20.0s)]
*  Well, judging by the reports this morning, it was not a major source of damage. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuqJrcplOoQ&t=29.0s)]
*  We have heard reports of two fatalities and a number of buildings that have been damaged in many cases by falling debris. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuqJrcplOoQ&t=38.0s)]
*  What often happens is that Ukraine's, the city's air defenses go into action and things are shot out of the sky. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuqJrcplOoQ&t=46.0s)]
*  And sometimes it is those fragments of drones and missiles that cause damage. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuqJrcplOoQ&t=53.0s)]
*  We're not aware that there were any direct hits as such. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuqJrcplOoQ&t=58.0s)]
*  Although clearly judging by some of the videos we've seen this morning, there is damage to buildings, some of it residential, some of it infrastructure. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuqJrcplOoQ&t=62.0s)]
*  We're never given precise details about anything that has any kind of security or defense value. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuqJrcplOoQ&t=73.0s)]
*  But it does seem as though some targets that have been hit in the past have also been struck again. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuqJrcplOoQ&t=80.0s)]
*  And Paul, we continue to hear from Ukrainian authorities asking for more defense systems. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuqJrcplOoQ&t=86.0s)]
*  How is it able to counter these Russian strikes at the moment? How is it coping with that? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuqJrcplOoQ&t=93.0s)]
*  Not badly, to be honest. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuqJrcplOoQ&t=101.0s)]
*  There was a time fairly recently when it seemed as though the pace of the Russian attacks and the sheer volume of the Russian attacks were beginning to overwhelm Ukraine's ability to cope. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuqJrcplOoQ&t=103.0s)]
*  And that ability consists of everything from men in the back of pickup trucks with machine guns to highly advanced Patriot interceptor missiles supplied by America. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuqJrcplOoQ&t=114.0s)]
*  And the city, in fact, Ukraine needs all of that in order to mount a comprehensive defense against this wide array of weapons that Russia is using, from the drones to the ballistic and cruise missiles. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuqJrcplOoQ&t=125.0s)]
*  And there has been, obviously in the past week, a great deal of concern that the supply of the high end equipment, the Patriot interceptor missiles, was in jeopardy following a decision by the Pentagon to suspend arms deliveries. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuqJrcplOoQ&t=138.0s)]
*  All the indications over the last couple of days seem to be that Donald Trump has reversed that and that those Patriot missiles may still arrive. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuqJrcplOoQ&t=151.0s)]
*  We're not quite sure if they will be directly supplied from the United States or perhaps purchased through Europe. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuqJrcplOoQ&t=162.0s)]
*  But there is a sense that perhaps that moment of crisis is over. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuqJrcplOoQ&t=168.0s)]
*  And so Ukraine will continue to shoot down the vast majority of drones and missiles that are fired on this almost nightly basis now. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuqJrcplOoQ&t=172.0s)]
*  And Paul, over the last few months, we've been talking about efforts to reach a ceasefire, possibly a peace deal. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuqJrcplOoQ&t=183.0s)]
*  Yesterday we heard from the German Chancellor saying that all efforts to reach a peace agreement has been exhausted. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuqJrcplOoQ&t=190.0s)]
*  Where do we stand with that? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuqJrcplOoQ&t=197.0s)]
*  I think Friedrich Mertz kind of put it pretty well. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuqJrcplOoQ&t=200.0s)]
*  It does seem as though at the moment diplomacy has run into the ground. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuqJrcplOoQ&t=203.0s)]
*  Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, used very similar language a couple of days ago. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuqJrcplOoQ&t=209.0s)]
*  And so there is a sense that despite the sense of kind of vigor and determination that the Trump administration came in with in the early part of this year, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuqJrcplOoQ&t=214.0s)]
*  all efforts to try and secure a ceasefire, whether a short-term one or a longer-term one, have come to nothing. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuqJrcplOoQ&t=224.0s)]
*  And so all the talk really at the moment is back on the questions of how do we make sure that Ukraine is able to defend itself? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuqJrcplOoQ&t=232.0s)]
*  And that's where things like Patriot missiles and other weapons systems are so important. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuqJrcplOoQ&t=240.0s)]
*  But also how can Ukraine be made economically resilient, able to withstand the pressures placed on it by Russia for the long term? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuqJrcplOoQ&t=244.0s)]
*  All thought of this war ending in 2025, which many people thought would happen at the beginning of the year, that really does seem to have evaporated. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuqJrcplOoQ&t=254.0s)]
*  Paul, thank you. That's our diplomatic correspondent, Paul Adams, in Kiev there. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuqJrcplOoQ&t=264.0s)]
