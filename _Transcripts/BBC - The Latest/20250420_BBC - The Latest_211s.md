Video Description: The Israeli military has said "professional failures" led to the killing of 15 emergency workers in Gaza last month.

An inquiry into the incident by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) found a series of failings, including an "operational misunderstanding" and a "breach of orders".

The deputy commander of the unit involved has been dismissed "for providing an incomplete and inaccurate report during the debrief".

A spokeswoman for the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said the report was "invalid" as it "justifies and shifts the responsibility to a personal error in the field command when the truth is quite different".

Fourteen emergency workers and a UN worker were killed on 23 March after a convoy of PRCS ambulances, a UN car and a fire truck came under fire by the Israeli military.

In a statement, the IDF said its troops opened fire believing they were facing a threat from enemy forces.
The IDF said its investigation found six of the casualties were Hamas members, and rejected that there had been summary executions.

The report said the incident took place in what it called a "hostile and dangerous combat zone", and that the commander on the ground perceived an immediate and tangible threat after vehicles approached rapidly.
It blamed "poor night visibility", which the IDF said meant the commander did not identify the vehicles as ambulances.

Israel had originally claimed troops opened fire because the convoy approached "suspiciously" in darkness without headlights or flashing lights. It said movement of the vehicles had not been previously co-ordinated or agreed with the army.

But a video found on the mobile phone of a medic who was killed showed the vehicles with their lights on and their emergency signals flashing. The footage shows the vehicles pulling up on the road when shooting begins just before dawn. The video continues for more than five minutes, with the paramedic saying his last prayers before the voices of Israeli soldiers are heard approaching the vehicles.

It also shows the vehicles were clearly marked and the paramedics wearing reflective hi-vis uniform.

The bodies of the 15 dead workers were buried in sand. They were not uncovered until a week after the incident because international agencies, including the UN, were not permitted safe passage to the area.

**BBC - The Latest:** [April 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dIG0QnhV0)
*  The Israeli army says it's dismissed a deputy commander over the killing of 14 Palestinian medics [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dIG0QnhV0&t=0.0s)]
*  and a UN worker in Gaza last month, following its own investigation into what happened. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dIG0QnhV0&t=6.0s)]
*  It said troops opened fire believing the vehicles were being used by Hamas. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dIG0QnhV0&t=12.0s)]
*  Images filmed by one of the medics who died showed the convoy travelling at night with flashing emergency lights, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dIG0QnhV0&t=17.0s)]
*  contradicting Israel's previous version of events. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dIG0QnhV0&t=24.0s)]
*  The killings caused international outrage and they're a cause for an independent inquiry. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dIG0QnhV0&t=27.0s)]
*  Paul Adams reports. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dIG0QnhV0&t=32.0s)]
*  It's been four weeks since a convoy of rescue vehicles raced through the pre-dawn darkness [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dIG0QnhV0&t=37.0s)]
*  to help colleagues ambushed by Israeli soldiers an hour earlier. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dIG0QnhV0&t=42.0s)]
*  One of the paramedics, Rifat Radwan, heard apologising to his mother and saying his prayers moments before he died. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dIG0QnhV0&t=47.0s)]
*  The Israeli military has taken its time coming up with a coherent account of what happened in the early hours of March 23rd. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dIG0QnhV0&t=59.0s)]
*  It now admits that its soldiers did mistakenly kill the rescue workers, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dIG0QnhV0&t=66.0s)]
*  but it says that the soldiers believed that they were operating in a situation of real danger. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dIG0QnhV0&t=71.0s)]
*  The soldiers, we're told, thought they were dealing with Hamas, which has used ambulances as cover in the past. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dIG0QnhV0&t=77.0s)]
*  But in the dark, the commander made fatal mistakes. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dIG0QnhV0&t=84.0s)]
*  The examination determined that the fire in the first two incidents resulted from an operational misunderstanding by the troops. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dIG0QnhV0&t=89.0s)]
*  The IDF regrets the harm caused to uninvolved civilians. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dIG0QnhV0&t=96.0s)]
*  We're now looking for the bodies. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dIG0QnhV0&t=100.0s)]
*  When Israel finally allowed the UN to visit the site four days later, grim discoveries. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dIG0QnhV0&t=102.0s)]
*  Bodies dumped in a mass grave, vehicles mangled and buried in the sand. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dIG0QnhV0&t=108.0s)]
*  The IDF says that the soldiers were not able to find the bodies. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dIG0QnhV0&t=114.0s)]
*  They were forced to leave the site. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dIG0QnhV0&t=118.0s)]
*  Bodies dumped in a mass grave, vehicles mangled and buried in the sand. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dIG0QnhV0&t=120.0s)]
*  Israel is adamant it was not trying to hide the evidence. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dIG0QnhV0&t=127.0s)]
*  The paramedics were not tied up or executed. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dIG0QnhV0&t=131.0s)]
*  Despite early rumors, Palestinian forensic investigators aren't claiming this either. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dIG0QnhV0&t=134.0s)]
*  We found the entry and exit points of gunshot wounds, mostly in the torso, between the chest and abdomen. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dIG0QnhV0&t=141.0s)]
*  In three cases, the wounds were in the head. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dIG0QnhV0&t=148.0s)]
*  One of the surviving paramedics, Asad al-Nasasra, is still being held by Israel, his family waiting for news. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dIG0QnhV0&t=151.0s)]
*  When we heard Asad was detained, we were slightly relieved. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dIG0QnhV0&t=159.0s)]
*  But we don't know what prison he was taken to or how he is being treated. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dIG0QnhV0&t=163.0s)]
*  So we are still very worried. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dIG0QnhV0&t=167.0s)]
*  Tonight, a spokeswoman for the Palestine Red Crescent rejected Israel's findings. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dIG0QnhV0&t=170.0s)]
*  The report, she said, was full of lies. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dIG0QnhV0&t=175.0s)]
*  Israel says six of the paramedics it killed were also members of Hamas. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dIG0QnhV0&t=181.0s)]
*  And it says it plans to name them. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dIG0QnhV0&t=186.0s)]
*  And at this afternoon's briefing, officials showed us aerial footage which indicated that several other vehicles, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dIG0QnhV0&t=189.0s)]
*  including an ambulance, were not shot at as they passed by in the hour between the first and second ambushes. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dIG0QnhV0&t=196.0s)]
*  Proof, the Israelis say, that its troops don't simply open fire on medical vehicles unless they feel threatened. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-dIG0QnhV0&t=204.0s)]
