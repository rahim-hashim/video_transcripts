Video Description: Major films in production including Avatar and Gladiator sequels are looking likely to be affected by Hollywood actors taking strike action.

In the industry's biggest shutdown for over 60 years, some 160,000 performers stopped work at midnight in Los Angeles.

Screen Actors Guild members want a fairer split of profits from streaming giants and better working conditions.

The unions are also concerned about the use of artificial intelligence and how it could be used in the industry.

# Actors join writers in massive Hollywood strike â€“ BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [July 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik)
*  Now, America's film and TV industry is expected to grind to a halt today as tens of thousands [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=0.0s)]
*  of Hollywood actors join screenwriters in the first industry-wide strike in more than [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=5.36s)]
*  60 years. The Screen Actors Guild has been calling on studios and streaming companies [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=10.36s)]
*  to agree to increase fees for repeats and it wants assurances about the use of artificial [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=15.34s)]
*  intelligence. The shutdown will affect all productions employing members of the union, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=20.32s)]
*  even if they're outside the US. From Hollywood, Peter Beaus sent this report. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=25.16s)]
*  From a red carpet in London to studios in LA, actors are walking off the job. Even before [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=32.72s)]
*  the strike had officially started, stars at the much anticipated UK premiere of Oppenheimer [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=42.16s)]
*  showed their solidarity with fellow actors here in Hollywood. Caleon Murphy and Emily [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=48.04s)]
*  Blunt left the screening, along with Mark Damon, who said it was in support of colleagues [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=53.12s)]
*  who are struggling to make a living. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=58.08s)]
*  You have to make $26,000 a year to qualify for your health insurance and there are a [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  lot of people who get across that threshold through their residual payments. And so, you [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=64.44s)]
*  know, we can go long stretches without working and not by choice, obviously, and we have [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=70.0s)]
*  to find a way to bridge so that those people who are on the bubble are taken care of. And, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=76.58s)]
*  it's just got to be a fair deal. We've got to get what we're worth. And there's money [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=82.52000000000001s)]
*  being made and it needs to be allocated in a way that takes care of people who are on [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=87.68s)]
*  the margins. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=93.16000000000001s)]
*  Much of Hollywood has already closed down. The writers' dispute is deadlocked and now [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=94.72s)]
*  the actors are following suit. Almost all film and TV production will grind to a standstill. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=99.68s)]
*  The issues are similar for both groups of workers. Concerns about the use of artificial [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=105.56s)]
*  intelligence and better pay in the age of streaming entertainment. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=110.28s)]
*  We are the victims here. We are being victimised by a very greedy entity. I am shocked by the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=115.08s)]
*  way the people that we have been in business with are treating us. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=126.80000000000001s)]
*  In a statement, the studio said they were deeply disappointed that the union had dismissed [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=132.72s)]
*  a historic pay increase. They added that the strike would lead to financial hardship for [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=137.32s)]
*  countless thousands of people who depend on the industry. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=142.6s)]
*  Aside from money, many Hollywood actors are worried about having a job at all. The union [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=146.44s)]
*  wants guarantees that computer generated faces and voices won't be used in their place. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=151.2s)]
*  It is a slippery slope into a very dangerous time and a real dystopia if big business corporations [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=157.35999999999999s)]
*  think that they can put human beings out of work and replace them with artificial intelligence. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=165.16000000000003s)]
*  It's dangerous and it's without thinking or conscience. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=173.84s)]
*  With the two sides seemingly far apart, Hollywood is gearing up for a long and painful strike. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=179.12s)]
*  Peter Beaux, BBC News, Los Angeles. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=185.32000000000002s)]
*  A little earlier I spoke to CBS correspondent Jared Hill who is in New York and asked him [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=187.56s)]
*  what the studios have offered so far. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=193.12s)]
*  We do know apparently that the studios have offered essentially one deal when it comes [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=195.68s)]
*  to AI where there would be a certain number of times that they could potentially use the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=200.04s)]
*  image or likeness of let's say a background actor. But then there still is this argument [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=205.07999999999998s)]
*  from the guild that that is utilising the image, the likeness, the identity essentially [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=210.56s)]
*  of an actor when they're not getting paid for it. So that really ends up being the big [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=215.8s)]
*  sticking point at least for the Screen Actors Guild here. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=221.12s)]
*  I suppose they can carry on using it for a long time afterwards as well which is another [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=223.51999999999998s)]
*  one of their concerns. What about the impact that this strike action is having? We're [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=227.51999999999998s)]
*  hearing in Peter Beaux's report there that most of Hollywood is pretty much shut down. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=232.79999999999998s)]
*  There's many thousands of people involved in this isn't there? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=237.68s)]
*  In fact there probably are millions of people involved. On one hand you do have the physical [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=241.51999999999998s)]
*  production of these television and movie programmes in the US and really around the world. Those [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=245.2s)]
*  can no longer happen. You won't have actors producing the projects. You won't have actors [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=250.96s)]
*  promoting any of those whether it's on social media, on a red carpet, on a television show. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=255.68s)]
*  None of that can happen at this point. But then there is a larger fallout right? An economic [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=260.32s)]
*  hit that really will be taken when it comes to restaurants that operate around some of [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=264.92s)]
*  these production houses where they would be providing lunch service or catering if there [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=270.64s)]
*  is a movie that's being made. Same thing with some of these catering businesses. A lot of [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=275.84000000000003s)]
*  the equipment that is used in these productions isn't owned by the production company. It might [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=279.44s)]
*  be rented out by a smaller company that has a lot of these cameras and things like that. Those [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=284.8s)]
*  organisations are now saying that they are seeing their business dry up because if you can't make a [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=290.4s)]
*  movie you don't need to rent the equipment from someone else. And so there are other fallouts [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=295.44s)]
*  along the line that are not just associated directly with the filmmaking itself. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=300.48s)]
*  And an impact on fans of course as well. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=304.24s)]
*  Yeah definitely. I mean people are excited about whatever TV show or movie that they were hoping [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=307.68s)]
*  was going to be coming out. And at this point we are not going to see those productions going [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=312.48s)]
*  through. At least not until this strike is over. We know that a number of shows have already [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=317.20000000000005s)]
*  announced that their productions have halted. Some movies have announced those. And these are [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=321.76000000000005s)]
*  pretty big names. Everything from you know the Game of Thrones spin-off to the Wizard of Oz movie. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=325.52000000000004s)]
*  None of that action is going to be happening. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=330.16s)]
*  I saw a spokesperson for the union yesterday saying they didn't know actually how long this [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=332.24s)]
*  was going to go on for. What do you think the chances are of a resolution? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=336.56s)]
*  Well you know what I think probably matters a lot less than what the studio heads and the heads of [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=341.44s)]
*  SAG think here. And as we have heard again especially from the head of SAG-AFTRA they're [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=347.84s)]
*  saying that they don't know when this will end. Both parties are putting the ball in the other [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=353.92s)]
*  person's court. And so we'll have to wait and see which one essentially blinks first. But remember [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=358.08s)]
*  you have not only the Screen Actors Guild right now but also the Writers Guild. And so a lot of [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=364.0s)]
*  work in Hollywood is being put on hold. And we'll have to see how much pressure viewers really end [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=368.72s)]
*  up putting on either side to come to a resolution. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Iw7YW7GPik&t=375.2s)]
