Video Description: A TikTok ban in the US is set to go ahead on Sunday after the Supreme Court rejected an appeal, ruling that the law passed by Congress asking the app's Chinese owner to sell its stake did not violate free speech rights. 
 
The legal drama stems from the US government's national security concerns and TikTok's ties to China. Last year, ByteDance was ordered to sell the app to a US buyer or it would be banned by 19 January - that sale has not yet happened. 
 
TikTok is one of the most popular short-form video apps in the world, and is a major part of a multi-billion dollar influencer economy.

# TikTok faces ban in US by Sunday after Supreme Court rejects appeal | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4)
*  That judgment around Tiktok has just come in. I will read you the one [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=0.0s)]
*  line ruling that we have so far. The US Supreme Court rules against [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=10.02s)]
*  TikTok's challenge to that law that would force a sale or a ban applying [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=13.92s)]
*  in the United States. That ban comes into effect on Sunday. They heard [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=18.96s)]
*  the representations from TikTok. We were waiting for that judgment. It [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=23.98s)]
*  that judgment. It has just come. So let's head to our North America correspondent, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=28.02s)]
*  Nomiya Iqbal, who's there in Washington. Nomiya, tell us more. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=31.86s)]
*  Yes, so it's not a surprising ruling. The US Supreme Court had indicated that it was [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=37.78s)]
*  likely to uphold this legislation. Now, it was signed by President Biden last year, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=43.3s)]
*  and it was a bipartisan law. So it was as bipartisan as you can get when it comes to [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=50.42s)]
*  modern day Washington. And as you mentioned there, it will go into effect on Sunday. Now, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=56.74s)]
*  just to sort of say, what does a ban mean? So if you have TikTok, it doesn't mean you're suddenly [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=63.940000000000005s)]
*  going to be arrested from Sunday if you're using it. If you already have TikTok as a user, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=68.98s)]
*  remember there's 170 million people in this country who use TikTok. The app will not be [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=74.98s)]
*  available to you on these platforms like Apple and Google and so forth. So you won't be able to [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=80.9s)]
*  update it or any of the kind of security updates. The app can get buggy and what have you. You won't [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=86.18s)]
*  be able to update it. And eventually, the view is that it probably could get killed off. If you [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=91.14s)]
*  haven't got TikTok, then it won't be available to you to download. And basically, the heart of the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=97.54s)]
*  battle has been this whole argument about free speech and whether or not this is TikTok's argument, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=106.9s)]
*  this should be allowed. But lawmakers say this is about national security. Now, it's worth mentioning [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=114.82s)]
*  that President Biden has left it to Donald Trump's administration to implement this law. But Donald [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=121.69999999999999s)]
*  Trump, who was the first person to actually talk about wanting to ban TikTok, has now done a U-turn [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=128.01999999999998s)]
*  on it because it was very successful for him in the presidential campaign. And he has said that he [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=134.34s)]
*  wants to save TikTok. Exactly how he'll do that, we don't know. Yes, and his national security advisor, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=139.62s)]
*  the incoming advisor, has already indicated that the president-elect is looking at ways perhaps [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=146.18s)]
*  around the ban. As you say, they were anticipating the Supreme Court would go this way. As you say, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=152.58s)]
*  Donald Trump has flip-flopped. He supported the ban, then he used it so successfully in his [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=157.86s)]
*  election. He's even got the TikTok boss apparently invited to the inauguration on Monday. So do we [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=162.82s)]
*  know any of the details when those advisors and officials say he's looking at ways to work around [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=170.26s)]
*  this? How they would work around this? Well, they've not given us any details yet. And yes, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=175.62s)]
*  he does have the CEO of TikTok at his inauguration, which gives you a sense of, you know, just how close [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=182.18s)]
*  he is with TikTok and wanting to save it. But in terms of how he does it, so could he repeal the law? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=188.66s)]
*  Not really. It's really hard to do that because, as I mentioned, it was a bipartisan law. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=196.9s)]
*  Could he potentially not enforce the law? So his incoming attorney general, Pam Bonny, could he say [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=202.1s)]
*  to her, don't enforce the law, you know, if it appears on these platforms and people still [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=207.78s)]
*  download it, you know, just effectively allow the law to become redundant. And the problem with that, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=212.98s)]
*  I guess, would be that what he'd be saying to the people that own these platforms is that we won't [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=218.98s)]
*  enforce the law and they would have to take his word for it, which might be quite difficult given [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=224.66s)]
*  that Donald Trump is a pretty mercurial person and they would want guarantees that they weren't going [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=228.82s)]
*  to be fined in any way. But he has said that he wants to find ways to save it. You know, ultimately, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=236.1s)]
*  what they want is to sell TikTok off to a US company. But TikTok has said that they won't do that. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=244.82s)]
*  I mean, there's certainly a lot of buyers in the US that wouldn't be a problem to sell it off. But [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=251.45999999999998s)]
*  TikTok has said that they do not want to do that. So that could be one of the options. But it's [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=255.29999999999998s)]
*  worth mentioning, Matthew, that, you know, this is hugely controversial. I remember last year, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=262.42s)]
*  there were lots of protests outside the White House when the law was signed and spoke to a lot [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=267.54s)]
*  of content creators who said, you know, it's not just an app where I go on and, you know, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=271.7s)]
*  watch music videos or have fun. For many, many Americans, it's where they have their businesses. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=279.22s)]
*  It's their livelihood, it's how they make money. For a lot of young people, it's how they get their [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=284.90000000000003s)]
*  news. So it is something that is deeply cultural now in this country. And it's hugely controversial [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=289.3s)]
*  to even ban it, which is presumably why Donald Trump wants to try and save it. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=294.66s)]
*  Now, separately, although the president-elect is so involved in this story, and of course, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=301.3s)]
*  China is the backdrop to everything that we are talking about with TikTok, news in the last, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=308.02s)]
*  what, 45 minutes that Donald Trump has had a phone call with President Xi. Tell me more about that. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=313.7s)]
*  He has, and he put out on his social media platform that they talked about a lot of things, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=319.46000000000004s)]
*  including TikTok. The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, also spoke a while ago. He said that [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=326.58s)]
*  they both hoped for a positive start to Chinese-U.S. relations during the new term. And both men place [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=333.94s)]
*  great importance on interactions. They said that they want to promote greater progress in China-U.S. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=341.94s)]
*  relations. I mean, TikTok is definitely going to be one of those issues that they will be talking [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=348.42s)]
*  about. As I mentioned before, lawmakers, and many of them are Republicans who are very loyal to [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=354.18s)]
*  Donald Trump, want TikTok banned. They believe that China, because it owns the algorithm, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=360.82s)]
*  it cannot be trusted, that it's a national security issue. They're using the app to spy [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=367.14s)]
*  on Americans. Also, they're using it to promote Chinese propaganda. There's no hard evidence [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=371.70000000000005s)]
*  that's been shown regarding that. But that is the concern. Let me also add that Donald Trump has [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=377.86s)]
*  invited Xi Jinping to his inauguration. I don't think he's taken up that invite, but I understand [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=383.22s)]
*  that he will be sending an envoy instead to the inauguration. So they will, as I say, TikTok will [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=388.1s)]
*  be one of those big issues that I'm sure that they will talk about. Exactly how Donald Trump plans to [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=396.42s)]
*  resolve it, we just don't know yet. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7a_Hb-m-w4&t=402.5s)]
