Video Description: A US judge has ruled that there is probable cause to find the Trump administration in contempt of court after it violated an order against deporting migrants under an obscure wartime law.
 
Judge James Boasberg said the government had shown “wilful disregard” of his order to halt the departure of deportation flights carrying more than 200 people to El Salvador last month.
 
In a statement, the White House said it would contest the decision.

*  had shown willful disregard of his verbal order to turn the deportation flights around. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=24.32s)]
*  His decision to begin contempt proceedings escalates a clash between the White House [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=29.6s)]

*  latest ruling. John Sudworth reports. Four weeks ago, President Trump's anti-immigration drive took [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=44.08s)]
*  a new turn. More than 200 people, many of them alleged to be gang members, were loaded onto [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=52.08s)]
*  flights and deported to a maximum security jail in El Salvador. But with the flights already in [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=58.88s)]
*  the air, a dramatic courtroom hearing was unfolding below. Shortly after they took off from Texas, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=67.12s)]
*  a senior U.S. judge ordered that they be immediately turned around, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=74.16s)]
*  citing the fact that those on board had been given no opportunity to challenge their removal. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  Now, the judge, James Boesberg, has issued a stinging rebuke. The government's actions on that [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=83.92s)]
*  day demonstrate a willful disregard for the court's order, he wrote in his latest ruling, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=90.80000000000001s)]
*  concluding that probable cause exists to find the government in criminal contempt. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=97.44000000000001s)]
*  Last month, President Trump, already angered by the attempts to stop the flights, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=103.76s)]
*  called for the judge to be dismissed. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=108.48s)]
*  But many people have called for his impeachment, the impeachment of this judge. I don't know who [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=110.24s)]
*  the judge is, but he's radical left. He was Obama appointed. And earlier this week, he welcomed [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=114.72s)]
*  El Salvador's president to the White House, the two men openly celebrating their deportation [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=123.11999999999999s)]
*  agreement. Well, they'd love to have a criminal, you know, reduced into a... [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=129.12s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, there's a fascination. They would love it. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=131.84s)]
*  The judge's ruling, though, cited this tweet from Naib Bukheli. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=135.44s)]
*  Oopsie. Too late, he wrote shortly after the planes took off. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=139.84s)]
*  The retweeting of that post by the U.S. secretary of state Marco Rubio showed, the judge said, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=145.76s)]
*  not only willful, but gleeful defiance of his order to turn the planes back. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=151.76s)]
*  A finding of criminal contempt against the U.S. government would be rare. But those deported [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=158.56s)]
*  appear to have disappeared into a legal black hole with little public evidence offered for their [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=164.24s)]
*  gang member status. The judge has given Justice Department officials a week to rectify their [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=169.60000000000002s)]
*  actions or, he said, face prosecution. John Sudworth, let's speak to CBS correspondent [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=175.84s)]
*  Jared Hill. Jared, what hope does the White House have of appealing the court order? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=182.56s)]
*  Well, that's their plan. They're going to try and appeal any of these court orders that are [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=187.84s)]
*  coming down against them to the highest possible level, which is obviously the Supreme Court. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=191.36s)]
*  The Supreme Court has weighed in a bit on this issue in the past, saying that the administration [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=195.76000000000002s)]
*  is able to use this wartimes act, but that it does need to, at least for a certain group of [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=202.96s)]
*  Venezuelan migrants who were still in the country, they do need to allow for all of them to have [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=208.24s)]
*  individual court hearings or at least have the opportunity to challenge these deportations in [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=213.12s)]
*  the court. Will that also fly for this group who are already out of the country? That's yet to be [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=217.28s)]
*  seen, but we're definitely seeing the administration saying that they're planning on challenging this [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=222.8s)]
*  ruling in the court as they have with so many others. To what extent, though, can the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=226.96s)]
*  government, the White House, avoid being on a collision course with the judiciary over this? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=232.24s)]
*  Well, one of the questions is, are they looking to avoid being on a collision course with the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=238.16s)]
*  judiciary? One of the things that we've seen from the current Trump administration and [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=242.24s)]
*  in some ways when President Trump was running for president this most recent time is this effort [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=247.28s)]
*  to challenge the extent of the powers of the presidency, challenge the extent of the powers of [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=253.92000000000002s)]
*  the executive branch and see how far can the president maneuver with some of these efforts [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=259.76s)]
*  that he is trying to make. On social media, the president has said that all of these things are [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=265.52s)]
*  being done with the intention of making the country safer, better, more wealthy, but the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=269.44s)]
*  question still remains how far will in the end the Supreme Court allow for the president to maneuver [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=275.2s)]
*  without having to really abide by some of the checks and balances that are built into the system. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=282.08s)]
*  Is this the end, though, of Donald Trump's election promise to carry out the largest [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=287.59999999999997s)]
*  deportation program in American history, as he called it? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=292.0s)]
*  Yet to be seen. I mean, I think that this, from what we've seen so far, this is definitely not [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=295.76s)]
*  stopping the Trump administration from making efforts to go forward with these sweeping [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=300.88s)]
*  deportation efforts. It might be the beginnings of some reevaluations of the methodology [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=306.8s)]
*  through which they go through those efforts, but from what we are seeing here, there is no [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=314.0s)]
*  attempt by the administration to stop or halt their efforts to go through with these mass deportations. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=318.48s)]
*  For the moment, thank you very much. Jared Hill from CBS. Thank you. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=248rtQ726cY&t=325.84s)]
