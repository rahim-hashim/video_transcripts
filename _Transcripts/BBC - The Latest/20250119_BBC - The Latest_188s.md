# Can Donald Trump keep his promises? | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [January 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA2nnkJQTtE)
*  Donald Trump has made a lot of promises, but as president, can he keep them? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA2nnkJQTtE&t=0.0s)]
*  First, there's the economy. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA2nnkJQTtE&t=6.0s)]
*  My plan will rapidly defeat inflation, quickly bring down prices and reignite explosive economic growth. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA2nnkJQTtE&t=9.0s)]
*  Inflation was high under Biden, but it came down. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA2nnkJQTtE&t=17.0s)]
*  Donald Trump says he'll increase taxes, known as tariffs, on imports from some of America's biggest trading partners. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA2nnkJQTtE&t=22.0s)]
*  Trump raised tariffs in his first term, and studies found consumer prices for some products went up. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA2nnkJQTtE&t=30.0s)]
*  That could happen again. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA2nnkJQTtE&t=37.0s)]
*  More broadly, under Biden, the economy has grown. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA2nnkJQTtE&t=40.0s)]
*  As one analyst puts it, success for the Trump administration would be to do no harm to the exceptionally performing economy it's inheriting. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA2nnkJQTtE&t=44.0s)]
*  But there are warnings. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA2nnkJQTtE&t=53.0s)]
*  The International Monetary Fund, based here in Washington, says new tariffs may deliver growth, but with the risk of a downturn to follow. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA2nnkJQTtE&t=55.0s)]
*  Next is illegal immigration. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA2nnkJQTtE&t=64.0s)]
*  On day one, I will launch the largest deportation program in American history. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA2nnkJQTtE&t=67.0s)]
*  It's estimated over 13 million immigrants are in the U.S. illegally. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA2nnkJQTtE&t=73.0s)]
*  This graph shows the number of repatriations, including deportations, under Obama, then Trump, then Biden. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA2nnkJQTtE&t=78.0s)]
*  And in his second term, Trump wants a significant increase. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA2nnkJQTtE&t=86.0s)]
*  This will ask a lot of the system. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA2nnkJQTtE&t=91.0s)]
*  One expert argues every possible institution involved in this is already hugely overburdened. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA2nnkJQTtE&t=93.0s)]
*  It's just a recipe for institutional breakdown, they say. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA2nnkJQTtE&t=99.0s)]
*  On the campaign trail, Trump also promised to close the U.S.-Mexico border and to suspend refugee admissions. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA2nnkJQTtE&t=104.0s)]
*  As president, he can order deportations and changes to border policy, but the implementation may not be straightforward. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA2nnkJQTtE&t=111.0s)]
*  The next promise is on Ukraine. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA2nnkJQTtE&t=120.0s)]
*  I will end that war in one day. It will take 24 hours. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA2nnkJQTtE&t=123.0s)]
*  Trump hasn't said how he'll do this. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA2nnkJQTtE&t=126.0s)]
*  He could offer reassurances that the military alliance NATO won't expand towards Russia. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA2nnkJQTtE&t=129.0s)]
*  He could ask Ukraine to accept some loss of territory. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA2nnkJQTtE&t=135.0s)]
*  He could reduce U.S. military aid. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA2nnkJQTtE&t=138.0s)]
*  But common ground between Russia and Ukraine appears scarce. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA2nnkJQTtE&t=141.0s)]
*  Trump's envoy on the war says he'd like a solution within 100 days. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA2nnkJQTtE&t=145.0s)]
*  Even that is hard to deliver. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA2nnkJQTtE&t=150.0s)]
*  There are some promises Donald Trump can definitely keep. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA2nnkJQTtE&t=153.0s)]
*  He has both houses of Congress on side and a range of presidential powers. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA2nnkJQTtE&t=157.0s)]
*  He's talked of pardoning some of the January the 6th rioters and of easing regulations on petrol cars. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA2nnkJQTtE&t=162.0s)]
*  If he chooses, he can do these. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA2nnkJQTtE&t=169.0s)]
*  Donald Trump will have considerable power, but to deliver some of his biggest promises [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA2nnkJQTtE&t=172.0s)]
*  will not only require bringing in new laws and policies, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA2nnkJQTtE&t=179.0s)]
*  it's also about their implementation and their impact. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA2nnkJQTtE&t=183.0s)]
