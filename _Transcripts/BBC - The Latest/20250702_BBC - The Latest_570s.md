Video Description: Ukraine has warned that an interruption of US weapons shipments might encourage Russia to continue the war.
 
The White House said that it had cut off some weapons deliveries to Ukraine - who have been at war with Russia for four years.
 
White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said the decision was taken "to put America's interests first" following a Department of Defence review of US "military support and assistance to other countries‚Äù.
 
Russia welcomed news of the reduction in weapons shipments, with the Kremlin saying reducing the flow of weapons to Kyiv will help end the conflict faster.

# US cuts off some weapons deliveries to Ukraine to 'put America's interests first' | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [July 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM)
*  Let's start in Ukraine, where Kiev has summoned a US diplomat over a decision to suspend weapons [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=0.0s)]
*  shipments. On Tuesday, the White House confirmed that some US deliveries had been put on pause [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=5.68s)]
*  over concerns that US stockpiles are too low. The US has not said what weapons would be affected [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  or the scale of the rollback, but it's believed to include Patriot air defense missiles and artillery [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=17.76s)]
*  shells. Ukraine has been urgently requesting more Patriots to protect its cities from Russian attacks. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=23.04s)]
*  The US has provided tens of billions of dollars of military aid to Ukraine since the invasion by [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=29.2s)]
*  Russia in 2022. A White House spokesperson said the decision was being made to put America's [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=34.4s)]
*  interests first. Russia has welcomed the news, saying it would bring the war closer to an end. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=41.28s)]
*  Kiev is warning though any delays will only embolden Moscow. Let's bring the reaction first [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=47.44s)]
*  from one Ukrainian MP. This decision is certainly very unpleasant for us. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  It's painful and against the background of the terrorist attacks which Russia commits against [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=58.56s)]
*  Ukraine, against peaceful towns, cities, villages, citizens of Ukraine that die almost every day [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=62.32s)]
*  from such terrorist attacks. It's a very unpleasant situation. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=68.56s)]
*  Let's take you live to Kiev. We can join our correspondent there Paul Adams and in Moscow [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=73.84s)]
*  is our Russia editor Steve Rosenberg. Paul, just hearing there what a blow this could potentially [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=77.76s)]
*  be for Ukraine. Just give us a sense of the reaction there. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=83.28s)]
*  Well it's very interesting because as that clip just illustrated there is an immediate kind of [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=89.28s)]
*  shudder of horror at the possibility that some of this vitally needed defensive equipment will [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=95.68s)]
*  somehow no longer be available or at some point may be withdrawn. But there's a statement in the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=101.76s)]
*  last 20 minutes or so from the defense ministry which I'm going to quote from because I think [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=108.56s)]
*  is quite important. It says first of all there has been no official confirmation of any suspension [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=112.32s)]
*  yet. The defense ministry says it's looking for further information. That's obviously why [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  we saw the US diplomat being called to the foreign ministry to explain exactly what's going on. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=123.36s)]
*  And also the defense ministry is urging people not essentially to jump to conclusions, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=129.76s)]
*  not to speak about things without adequate information. This is not a repeat of the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=135.28s)]
*  situation we had back earlier in the year following that dreadful row between Vladimir [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=141.44s)]
*  Zelensky and President Trump in the Oval Office in which the US suspended aid shipments and [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  intelligence cooperation for a week. There's nothing of that nature going on. This is a US [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=153.12s)]
*  decision to look at its stocks of, its dwindling stocks of equipment, dwindling because of obviously [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=158.48s)]
*  supplies to Ukraine but also events in the Middle East and to take stock of exactly where [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=165.2s)]
*  the US inventories are. So we don't know how long this suspension is going to last. We also don't [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=171.2s)]
*  know precisely which items of equipment are going to be affected although as you say there's been a [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=177.67999999999998s)]
*  lot of focus on patriot missiles and also on the missiles used by f-16 jets to intercept ballistic [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=183.51999999999998s)]
*  missiles and cruise missiles. So there is certainly a great deal of anxiety but everyone from the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=191.44s)]
*  president on down is basically saying let's find out what is really happening here. A great deal [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=197.28s)]
*  of anxiety Steve and also these real concerns that this could embolden Russia. Have we had a response [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=203.04s)]
*  from the Kremlin? Yes a short while ago on the daily Kremlin conference call, Dmitry Peskov, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=209.52s)]
*  Vladimir Putin's spokesman was asked for his reaction to this news. He didn't say very much [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=218.4s)]
*  but what he did say was the fewer weapons that Ukraine is supplied with the sooner the special [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=224.32s)]
*  military operation will end. The special military operation being the label the Russians give to [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=230.16s)]
*  Russia's war in Ukraine. Now what he said was obviously not earth-shattering. It was obvious [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=236.07999999999998s)]
*  right and Russia obviously is pleased at the prospect of less US military assistance to Ukraine [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=242.56s)]
*  because US military aid to Ukraine has been so important in helping Ukraine get to where it is [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=250.8s)]
*  now to helping Ukraine survive the Russian invasion. Russia is mounting attacks on Ukraine [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=257.12s)]
*  night after night Paul and I'm sure if you asked anyone on the streets of Kyiv they would tell you [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=265.52000000000004s)]
*  that they really need these patriots. That's the one thing every Ukrainian understands. Can you [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=270.40000000000003s)]
*  explain to us a bit more about what patriots do? Yes so essentially you have a kind of multi-layered [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=274.8s)]
*  air defense system designed to protect cities like Kyiv and other big cities and of course [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=283.84000000000003s)]
*  also military and industrial facilities. That involves at the very highest end the patriot [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=288.8s)]
*  missile. It's a highly sophisticated system designed to intercept ballistic missiles probably [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=294.40000000000003s)]
*  the single most deadly threat posed by Russia. Then of course you have all sorts of other systems [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=300.16s)]
*  from machine guns mounted on the back of pickup trucks on the ground to f-16 jets supplied by the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=307.04s)]
*  west which can fire missiles at oncoming incoming cruise missiles and also in some cases drones. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=313.68s)]
*  All of that is really important and the f-16s actually over the past year have really proved [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=322.40000000000003s)]
*  themselves a vital component of all of this. It's worth noting this though at the moment the [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=327.36s)]
*  US accounts for around 20 percent of the weaponry arriving in Ukraine. Europe about 25 percent and [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=333.52000000000004s)]
*  Ukraine itself around 50 percent but it is that crucial high-end equipment like the patriots, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=342.40000000000003s)]
*  like the missiles used on the f-16s those are the things that that Ukraine knows it can really [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=350.48s)]
*  only get from the United States until such time as it either builds its own capability [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=356.16s)]
*  or can somehow get it from somewhere else. Steve there is obviously ongoing conversations being [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=363.12s)]
*  had around the world about how to stop this war and influence the outcomes. We know that [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=367.76000000000005s)]
*  President Macron has also spoken to President Putin in the last 24 hours that's the first [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=373.92s)]
*  time in three years. What's come out of that? Yeah that was interesting and a little bit [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=379.84s)]
*  unexpected. This conversation telephone call happened yesterday as you say the first time [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=386.56s)]
*  in just under three years that President Macron and President Putin have spoken. Today the Kremlin [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=391.91999999999996s)]
*  said it was the initiative of President Macron to make this call. They spoke reportedly for more [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=397.59999999999997s)]
*  than two hours about the situation in the Middle East but of course also about the situation in [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=404.16s)]
*  Ukraine. On the Middle East the two sides seem to have more in common have more of a common approach [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=410.64000000000004s)]
*  but from the Kremlin readout and the the Paris readout of the call on Ukraine the two sides [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=417.52000000000004s)]
*  seem diametrically opposed. I mean President Macron was making it clear that offering his [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=425.44000000000005s)]
*  unwavering support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and calling for a ceasefire [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=430.24s)]
*  as soon as possible. Vladimir Putin according to the Kremlin readout blaming the West for the [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=436.8s)]
*  the conflict in Ukraine as he has done all along talking about Ukraine having been turned by the [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=443.76s)]
*  West into an anti-Russian bridgehead and talking again as he has done repeatedly about the need to [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=450.0s)]
*  remove the quote root causes of the conflict and take into account the realities on the ground. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=457.52s)]
*  So no sign from the readouts that the positions of Russia and France are any closer on Ukraine. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=465.68s)]
*  And Steve given the losses that are being sustained every single day is there any pressure [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=472.0s)]
*  inside Russia on President Putin to bring this conflict to an end? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=476.79999999999995s)]
*  Well if you talk about public opinion I wouldn't say the Kremlin is feeling pressure from from the [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=480.48s)]
*  Russian public. Certainly there is a fatigue when you speak to people. People talk about the war [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=490.64000000000004s)]
*  and they do use that word war. They don't say special military operation. People can see that [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=497.52000000000004s)]
*  it's a war. They switch on the television. They see tanks and artillery. It's a war. And so many [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=502.24s)]
*  people who speak to us say we want this to be over as soon as possible. We want peace. Then you [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=508.8s)]
*  ask people how can the peace be achieved. Many people say well we can't influence that. It's up [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=514.48s)]
*  to the people in power to decide how to do that. Some people say we need negotiations. We need talks. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=520.4s)]
*  Other people say peace can only be achieved by a Russian victory. So different approaches. But [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=526.72s)]
*  certainly we're in the fourth year of this war now and it's had devastating consequences of course [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=532.32s)]
*  first and foremost for Ukraine. The scale of death and destruction there. But people here in Russia [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=539.6800000000001s)]
*  are feeling tired and the economy is starting to buckle. Almost every day the Russian newspapers [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=545.12s)]
*  and this is a very controlled media environment right. But in the Russian newspapers every day [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=552.24s)]
*  there are articles about the economic problems building up in Russia. So people can feel the [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=557.44s)]
*  effects of this war. Steve, Paul, good to see you both. Thank you so much. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lus5mrosOM&t=565.12s)]
