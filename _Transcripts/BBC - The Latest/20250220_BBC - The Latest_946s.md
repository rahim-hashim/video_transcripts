# Russian ambassador on claims Zelensky helped start war in Ukraine | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ)
*  Mr Ambassador, thank you very much for talking to Newsnight. Last night, President Trump [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=0.0s)]
*  dismissed the idea that President Zelensky was being sidelined in the talks about its [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=5.96s)]
*  future and he said, quote, Well, you've been there for three years, you should have ended [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=10.92s)]
*  it. You should have never started it. You could have made a deal. Obviously, it was [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=15.6s)]
*  Russia who started it. When you hear the president of the United States making claims like that, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=21.56s)]
*  what do you think? I find that the British establishment is now in a state of shock and [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=27.96s)]
*  nervousness of what has happened. But what has happened in fact in reality, this is more [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=32.76s)]
*  understanding from the American side of what we are doing, why we are doing and what should [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  be the outcome of it. As for the particular statement on President Zelensky, there is [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=46.72s)]
*  first an obstacle for the negotiations because he has issued an executive order to prohibit [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=53.72s)]
*  himself for the negotiations and until he was going to remove it, all negotiations, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  as I said, seems to be illegal. So when you say you think the US administration has more [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=65.64s)]
*  of an understanding of your position, do you think they genuinely believe that Ukraine [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=71.32s)]
*  started the war? Well, that's a fact of life. The war has not started three years ago. The [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=79.19999999999999s)]
*  war has started after the coup d'etat by so-called Maidan in Kiev, which has brought nationalists [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=85.32s)]
*  to power and the first decree by this nationalist was prohibition of the Russian language, with [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=92.67999999999999s)]
*  which the part of Ukrainian population disagree. I mean, it's not a fact of life. The fact [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=98.19999999999999s)]
*  is it was Russia's military aggression in 2014 with Moscow's forced annexation of Crimea. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=104.04s)]
*  Well, in fact, I hope that in BBC they better learn history. That was a decree on the prohibition [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=113.0s)]
*  of the Russian language. The part of Ukrainian population in the East disagree with that [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=119.24000000000001s)]
*  and Ukrainian government has sent troops to the eastern part of it. That was the start [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=125.56s)]
*  of the conflict. Can I ask you about something that Marco Rubio said after that meeting yesterday? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=131.24s)]
*  The US Secretary of State said, in order to bring an end to any conflict, there has to [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=140.0s)]
*  be concessions made by all sides. Will Russia compromise? It is difficult to say. What has [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=144.76000000000002s)]
*  happened yesterday, it has had three outcomes. First and foremost, it was the establishment [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=151.16000000000003s)]
*  of contacts and diplomacy with the United States, which is a precondition for everything [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=156.88s)]
*  else. Second is that they have launched a process, a process, I will say, on Ukrainian [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=162.24s)]
*  settlement, which can, it is very initial phase what to do with that. And third, that [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=168.51999999999998s)]
*  both sides have agreed that we need full-scale relationship between United States and Russia. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=175.76s)]
*  All three outcomes are incredibly important for all of that. As for the process, as it [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=182.76s)]
*  is, it is in a very initial phase right now. So it is premature to speak about concessions [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=189.0s)]
*  or kind of agreements or what kind of framework it will come. I understand. But going on what [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=195.32s)]
*  Marco Rubio said, there has to be concessions made by all sides. I'm not asking you what [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=201.92s)]
*  concessions, I'm just asking for an insight, an indication. Is Russia prepared to compromise? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  It is just funny to speak about concessions in the negotiations, which did not start [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=212.48s)]
*  yet. What about giving back Ukraine some of its territory? Why should we? We have liberated [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=216.76s)]
*  these territories on which Russian people are living for centuries, actually. We suggested [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=224.16s)]
*  to Ukrainians several compromises in the course of the last 10 years. When you say, why should [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=229.88s)]
*  we give back some of Ukraine's territory, the answer from Ukrainians might be because [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=236.76s)]
*  it's Ukrainian territory. That's why Russia should give it back. I don't think so. We [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=243.76s)]
*  have suggested many times that they should just care of the human rights over the years, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=248.2s)]
*  of normal human rights like it exists in Europe, that Russians should be full-scale Russians [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=253.68s)]
*  and Russian-speaking population, should be a full-scale normal part of Ukrainian society [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=258.92s)]
*  without prohibiting Russian language and all of that stuff. I've interviewed some Ukrainians [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=264.56s)]
*  in the east of the country in the last three years. They grew up speaking Russian, they [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=269.92s)]
*  regarded Russians as their brothers, and they have had to flee because of Russian attacks [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=274.96s)]
*  on them. When there are battles, when there are clashes over there, it is clear that the [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=280.36s)]
*  population is going to flee. And I will say that we even helped many eastern Ukrainians [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=284.6s)]
*  to move into Russia. We have right now about six million or something of refugees. And [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=291.24s)]
*  right now they are going back in Mariupol. If I'm not mistaken, there are hundreds of [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=296.84000000000003s)]
*  thousands of those who have come back because Mariupol is under restoration right now. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=301.16s)]
*  How does Russia, how does Moscow view the prospect of tens of thousands of European [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=306.6s)]
*  and non-European troops along the front line? Our attitude will be negative to it. I don't [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=312.04s)]
*  think that it will not be part of the deal because if Europeans are going to install [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=318.35999999999996s)]
*  a certain contingent of the Ukrainian soil, it means that they are going to construct [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=324.2s)]
*  bases and infrastructure which does not deviate from NATO being on the territory of Ukraine. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=330.2s)]
*  But President Trump said last night he was fine with troops from other countries being [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=338.52s)]
*  positioned in Ukraine. I don't believe that they did discuss it in the course of the session of [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=342.84s)]
*  RIA because, for instance, London's concept of boots on the land changes every day. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=350.28s)]
*  I'm just giving you the quote from President Trump. The word he used was, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=359.15999999999997s)]
*  he's fine. He's fine with troops from other countries. He might be fine, but I can assure [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=363.55999999999995s)]
*  you that we will disagree and we will not accept the presence of military contingents [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=368.44s)]
*  from other countries of Europe who are members of NATO on the soil of Ukraine. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=373.71999999999997s)]
*  Without that, of course, Russia could come back to Ukraine. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=379.32s)]
*  No. What we are looking for, it is not a temporary ceasefire. It is not a truce. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=383.08s)]
*  It is overall settlement. Overall settlement that should include Ukraine, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=388.68s)]
*  countries in Europe, United States and all the others. Otherwise, of course, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=394.44s)]
*  we are not going to accept the British troops on the Ukrainian soil. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=399.0s)]
*  But if Ukrainians want British troops on Ukrainian soil, it's up to them, isn't it? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=403.8s)]
*  It will be a sort of a treaty or a deal or a negotiated settlement. Every element of this, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=407.08s)]
*  every presence during the, which stems from a treaty or an accord, it should be agreed by both [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=414.36s)]
*  sides. Could one of Russia's demands be that President Zelensky stands down [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=421.64000000000004s)]
*  as a condition of peace and elections are held in Ukraine? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=425.8s)]
*  None of our leaders has said that so far, but we believe that since his legitimacy has come to an [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=429.56s)]
*  end May last year, he should have elections since we do not see how we can negotiate with him [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=436.84000000000003s)]
*  something because if he fails to put his signature under any kind of agreement and tomorrow he will [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=445.72s)]
*  not be elected as the president, so this piece of paper will have not much of value. But we can go [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=452.2s)]
*  into negotiations with him if there is no other way. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=459.72s)]
*  But he is the president. He was democratically elected. You know there's martial law in Ukraine [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=462.52s)]
*  because Russia launched its full-scale invasion. That's why elections are on hold. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=467.48s)]
*  I think it is a big demand also from the Americans that Ukrainian population should express its will, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=472.76s)]
*  who should be the leader of Ukraine, and I'm not sure it will be Zelensky. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=481.08s)]
*  Does Russia accept that however this war ends, whatever is agreed about territory, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=485.88s)]
*  Ukraine will remain a sovereign and independent state? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=492.2s)]
*  I think the answer is positive to your question. We understand that Ukraine and we never denied [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=496.36s)]
*  that Ukraine should exist. Of course we have very many contradictions right now with Ukraine, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=502.52s)]
*  but it is... well we will see what will be the outcome, but we value and we respect very much [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=508.44s)]
*  Ukrainian people and populations. The problem is the government. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=517.8s)]
*  If you value and respect Ukrainian people, why have you killed so many of them? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=520.52s)]
*  Because of regime which is now in power right now. It has ideology which is absolutely anti-Russian [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=524.36s)]
*  and it is very nationalistic and it is between nationalism and fascism. The line is very thin. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=532.1999999999999s)]
*  It doesn't make sense. If you've got a problem with President Zelensky, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=540.12s)]
*  why would you kill innocent Ukrainians? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=543.96s)]
*  President Zelensky has come to power and got support from all Ukrainians as a present of peace. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=547.16s)]
*  He said that he will make... while being elected, he has said he will make peace with Russia very [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=553.3199999999999s)]
*  quickly. But then it appeared that he started a war and he is now leading the war very seriously. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=559.08s)]
*  He didn't start a war? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=566.76s)]
*  Good to hear from you. I just explained how it has started and you tried to say that. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=569.08s)]
*  Why is that funny? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=575.32s)]
*  Because it is like you listen but you do not hear. This is what has happened before with the [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=577.64s)]
*  Americans. And in Eryad it is for the first time we have noticed that they are not simply [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=585.4s)]
*  saying that this is Russian propaganda and disinformation. They have listened and they [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=592.76s)]
*  hear what we're saying. And from you it is all the same. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=597.72s)]
*  So they listen and if somebody agrees with you, that means they've listened and heard? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=601.3199999999999s)]
*  They heard. Yes, they heard and they understand what we are saying. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=606.76s)]
*  I remember you telling my colleague on Newsnight in January 2022 that the Russian troops in Belarus [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=610.6800000000001s)]
*  would not be going into Ukraine. They would be going back to Russia. And of course, weeks later [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=616.44s)]
*  Russia launched its fourth-scale invasion. Do you think people should believe you? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=623.4000000000001s)]
*  Victoria, I have answered this question very many times after 22 and all of that. Still every [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=628.36s)]
*  interviewer tried to ask me. I have said at that time what I have known at that time. That is all. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=633.96s)]
*  Will Russia pay for the reconstruction of Ukraine? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=641.0s)]
*  I'm sure that we are paying right now and quite a lot for reconstruction of parts that we have [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=645.4000000000001s)]
*  liberated. 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said 12,500 [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=651.08s)]
*  civilians had been killed. And again, I want to ask you, Russia bombed a theatre in Mariupol, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=658.2s)]
*  pizza restaurant, a shopping mall in Kremenchuk, a children's hospital in Kyiv. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=664.7600000000001s)]
*  Civilian targets? No, these are not civilian targets. The pizza that you have mentioned [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=671.72s)]
*  has been attached to the hotel which was full of soldiers, officers, especially from the NATO [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=677.32s)]
*  countries and all of that stuff. It is just one example. This is sufficient. We do not target [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=683.96s)]
*  civilians. We are targeting only Ukrainian military infrastructure, including into energy. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=688.36s)]
*  So there were soldiers in the children's hospital, in the shopping mall? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=696.36s)]
*  No, of course it is. Everybody is saying that the church was near here and it is [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=699.4000000000001s)]
*  usual stuff which is being invented after a certain attack. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=706.44s)]
*  It is not invented. Our Middle East editor, Jeremy Bowen, is in Sumi right now and he has seen [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=710.92s)]
*  a high-rise block of flats where families live. He said there is a great big hole in the side of it, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=718.1999999999999s)]
*  three stories high, and people were killed there. They are not soldiers. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=723.72s)]
*  Victoria, if you are aware and interview some people, Donetsk has been shelled during nine [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=728.52s)]
*  years of everyday shelling. A new generation of people has grown up under shells. There are [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=735.5600000000001s)]
*  lots of buildings demolished. I would very much advise you to go to Donetsk and to see its site [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=746.28s)]
*  and to listen to what people are saying. President Zelensky said after yesterday's [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=750.84s)]
*  Saudi meeting that Russia is run by pathological liars. It is something the now US Secretary of [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=755.16s)]
*  State Marco Rubio tweeted a few weeks after you launched the full-scale invasion. This was back [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=763.16s)]
*  in March 2022 when Marco Rubio was a senator. He wrote this, many in the West still don't understand [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=768.52s)]
*  that Putin is an expert liar. Are President Zelensky and Marco Rubio right? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=776.4399999999999s)]
*  Actually, if you want to insult our leader, then we do not have much to talk with you about it. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=786.4399999999999s)]
*  I have heard a lot of... I'm quoting other people. Yes, you may quote also Minister Lamy, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=792.4399999999999s)]
*  who is trying to... Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Lamy, who is trying to insult [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=797.96s)]
*  our leaders and our country very many times in the recent weeks and months when he has come to power. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=803.24s)]
*  I don't think that we will be interested, in fact, to talk or to think that [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=811.96s)]
*  London can play any role in this. Any role in what, sorry? In the settlement or the processes [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=819.32s)]
*  that are going on. And to come back to what Marco Rubio said in 2022 and what President Zelensky said [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=825.6400000000001s)]
*  yesterday, is President Putin a liar? Can Donald Trump trust him? We do not take any position on [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=831.72s)]
*  President Zelensky's statements. He do it every time and everywhere. He's the biggest liar in the [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=840.2800000000001s)]
*  world and as has been claimed by President Trump as well, of course, he's only seeking for money [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=845.88s)]
*  and all of that. He doesn't care about Ukrainians themselves if he has introduced them into such a [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=852.6s)]
*  battle. So it is question is to him. Can President Trump trust President Putin? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=858.28s)]
*  He never... Marco Rubio has during these talks and negotiations, they were very polite, I will say, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=863.72s)]
*  very diplomatic and of course, issues are very serious. I have also, I will tell you about the [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=871.08s)]
*  telephone conversations initially. It's a conversation between two states figures, two ministers, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=879.08s)]
*  real diplomatic and what has happened in Eryad, that was not bad. It was good. It was a mutual [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=885.08s)]
*  understanding. And as I understand also from the statements by President Putin, he never comes to [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=891.5600000000001s)]
*  the expressions like you have mentioned in your script over there. He's a very polite personality, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=898.6s)]
*  very serious personality. He has a strategic vision and probably here he is polite to President Trump [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=906.36s)]
*  and I understand he respects President Trump for his courage. And to come back finally to the [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=914.12s)]
*  question that I've asked a couple of times, can President Trump trust President Putin? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=919.96s)]
*  Well, they do have trust already in between them and they stated, they talked. Of course, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=925.24s)]
*  it was a long telephone conversation. How this telephone conversation could have happened without [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=932.6800000000001s)]
*  mutual trust. Mr. Ambassador, thank you very much for talking to Newsnight. Thank you. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejaMhGgwekQ&t=939.48s)]
