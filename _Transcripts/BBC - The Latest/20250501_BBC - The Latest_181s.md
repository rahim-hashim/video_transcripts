**BBC - The Latest:** [May 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8)
*  A national emergency has been called in Israel as strong winds and high temperatures have [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=0.0s)]
*  fuelled wildfires outside of Jerusalem. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=5.58s)]
*  Stop! [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=8.700000000000001s)]
*  I'm not doing anything! [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=9.700000000000001s)]
*  You're doing it! [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=10.700000000000001s)]
*  I'm not doing it! [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=11.700000000000001s)]
*  You're doing it! [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=12.700000000000001s)]
*  There's a video! [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=13.700000000000001s)]
*  You're hurting me! [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=14.700000000000001s)]
*  What is this? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=15.700000000000001s)]
*  I'm going to kill you! [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=16.7s)]
*  You're not going to get away! [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=17.7s)]
*  I'm going to kill you! [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=18.7s)]
*  No! [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=19.7s)]
*  No! [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=20.7s)]
*  No! [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=21.7s)]
*  Fire crews have been battling the fires there with several people reported to have been [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=22.7s)]
*  suffering from burns and smoke inhalation. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=24.12s)]
*  It's according to Israel's medical emergency services there. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=27.3s)]
*  Let's speak to our Middle East correspondent, Yolan Nel. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=31.0s)]
*  Yolan, talk us through the situation there. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=34.0s)]
*  So from what we understand, there are still about six areas in the hills outside of Jerusalem [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=38.5s)]
*  where you've got firefighters battling these flames. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=43.2s)]
*  They're being helped by the Israeli army as well. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=46.9s)]
*  There are several towns in that area that have been evacuated. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=50.1s)]
*  About 3,000 acres of land have been burned. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=54.6s)]
*  Now when the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was talking about this, he said [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=58.2s)]
*  there had been a deadly combination of dryness and strong winds. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=62.6s)]
*  You can see the wind is starting to pick up again now. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=67.2s)]
*  In some cases, arson is suspected, also poor land management. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=70.2s)]
*  And inevitably the Israeli media is really picking over this today talking about the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=75.1s)]
*  state's level of preparedness for such wildfires. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=79.4s)]
*  This is said to have been the biggest fire that the country has experienced. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=83.7s)]
*  And Israel has become more prone to wildfires of this kind in recent years, with experts [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=88.7s)]
*  warning that climate change is just going to make it even more prone that their fire [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=95.5s)]
*  hazard is increasing. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=101.4s)]
*  Yolan, thank you for that. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=104.0s)]
*  Well, let's speak now to BBC Weather presenter Simon King, who's standing by for us. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  Simon, just talk us through what's been happening. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=110.0s)]
*  Yes, so Lewis, of course, the wildfire itself may have been started by arson or other methods [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=112.39999999999999s)]
*  there, as Yolan said, about the poor land management. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=117.7s)]
*  But of course, when a fire starts, you look to the weather conditions to how severe or [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=120.89999999999999s)]
*  how far they may spread. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=125.89999999999999s)]
*  Now in Israel and Jerusalem, we've been seeing some strong winds recently. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=127.5s)]
*  Gusts today are up to about 50, 60 kilometres an hour. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=132.2s)]
*  And they, of course, just fan these flames. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=135.9s)]
*  And they're coming in from a westerly direction, which means at the moment they are on the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=139.2s)]
*  border of Israel and Jerusalem. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=142.89999999999998s)]
*  And there is concern that with that westerly wind, it will push the flames a little bit [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=144.7s)]
*  further eastward into Jerusalem itself. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=148.6s)]
*  Now temperatures across Israel and Jerusalem haven't actually been that high, rather average [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=151.5s)]
*  really, of about 22 to 25 degrees Celsius. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=157.0s)]
*  But of course, we're now going into the dry season in that region. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=160.5s)]
*  So of course, the vegetation is very dry already. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=164.29999999999998s)]
*  So when you get these fires that start, that's when they can spread really quite quickly. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=168.4s)]
*  Simon, thank you. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxi3wbQQEH8&t=173.9s)]
