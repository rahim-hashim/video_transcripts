Video Description: The death toll from flash floods that struck central Texas on Friday has now climbed to at least 107 people and an unknown number of others are missing.
 
Search and rescue teams are wading through mud-piled riverbanks as more rain and thunderstorms threaten the region, but hope was fading of finding any more survivors four days after the catastrophe.
 
Camp Mystic, a Christian all-girls' summer camp, confirmed at least 27 girls and staff were among the dead. Five campers and one adult are still missing.
 
The White House meanwhile rejected suggestions that budget cuts at the National Weather Service could have inhibited the disaster response.

**BBC - The Latest:** [July 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4)
*  Let's turn away from that to the US because hope is fading there of finding more survivors [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=0.0s)]
*  of the flash floods in Texas. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=6.4s)]
*  At least 100 people died after the Guadalupe River swelled more than 26 feet in an hour [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=8.32s)]
*  following the heavy rains. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=13.88s)]
*  The President says he plans to visit Texas on Friday. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=16.04s)]
*  In the last hour or so, the authorities have held a news conference. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=20.0s)]
*  Let's go to BBC's Carl Nasman who has been closely following what was said in that news [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=24.0s)]
*  briefing. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=32.8s)]
*  He is there on the ground in Texas for us. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=33.8s)]
*  Carl, let's start with what officials have been saying in the last little while. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=36.2s)]
*  An update on casualty numbers and the numbers that they are still searching for. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, we did get some updates on the number of people that sadly have passed away due [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=48.68s)]
*  to these floods. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=54.6s)]
*  It's now over 100. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=55.6s)]
*  That makes it even more deadly than what we saw after Hurricane Harvey back in 2017 here. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=57.2s)]
*  We're really one of the deadliest flooding incidents in a long time that we've seen [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  here in the country. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=67.56s)]
*  We also know that where we are right now, Kerr County, this has seen the lion's share [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=68.56s)]
*  of the destruction and of the deaths here. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=73.52s)]
*  Now, 87 people confirmed dead in this county alone. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=75.48s)]
*  That does include 30 children. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=79.76s)]
*  And of course, we've all heard about Camp Mystic, the camp which was a little ways actually [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=81.84s)]
*  down the river from where we are now. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=86.0s)]
*  Yesterday, they had said that they were looking for 10 girls and one counselor that were still [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=88.36s)]
*  missing. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=93.84s)]
*  Today, they've said that those numbers have dropped down to five children and one counselor. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=94.84s)]
*  So as you mentioned, hope is beginning to fade of finding any survivors at this point [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=99.68s)]
*  right now on the fifth day. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=105.28s)]
*  You can probably see behind me here, Matthew, actually some of the activity taking place [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=106.76s)]
*  where we are right here along the banks of the Guadalupe River. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=111.0s)]
*  And this just gives you a sense of the level of destruction and the power of those floodwaters [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=113.68s)]
*  as they pass through here over the holiday weekend. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=119.44s)]
*  This entire area where we're standing was filled with water. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=122.72s)]
*  And actually where we are, this was a RV park, mobile homes, several of them were parked [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=125.76s)]
*  all along the banks here. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=131.0s)]
*  None of those are left. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=132.88s)]
*  All you can see now are the twisted metal remains scattered along here. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=134.51999999999998s)]
*  And you can see several different points here, heavy machinery working to clear some of that [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=139.79999999999998s)]
*  out and that is just all part of the efforts that are taking place today up and down the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=145.0s)]
*  river really. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  You mentioned that press conference, we did get some updates about the actual search and [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=149.83999999999997s)]
*  rescue efforts which are continuing today. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=153.57999999999998s)]
*  We heard from Lieutenant Colonel Ben Baker of the Texas Game Wardens and he talked about [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=155.48s)]
*  just how difficult that search and rescue operation is. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  We've got numerous responders with specialized capabilities where we've got these large pile [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=164.72s)]
*  of debris. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=170.32s)]
*  And with our K-9s and when we're trying to make these recoveries, these large piles can [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=171.84s)]
*  be very obstructive. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=177.79999999999998s)]
*  And to get deep into these piles is very hazardous and those specialized teams have to go in [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=179.79999999999998s)]
*  there layer by layer because our first responders, also the safety of them is concerned. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=185.56s)]
*  So it's extremely treacherous, time consuming, it's dirty work, it's the water still there. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=190.95999999999998s)]
*  So we're having to go layer by layer, peeling these off to make those recoveries. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=198.23999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, so that's the latest that we know from officials and really now we're also starting [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=205.6s)]
*  to hear more and more questions from reporters and from people that live here about how exactly [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=210.0s)]
*  this happened. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=214.64s)]
*  Why were there so many people here that were affected by those floods? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=215.64s)]
*  Were there enough warnings in time? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=217.95999999999998s)]
*  So first standing, actually I was talking to the owner of the property here and she [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=220.12s)]
*  describes this scene where actually she didn't get a warning, she came out and had to start [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=223.35999999999999s)]
*  evacuating people from the mobile homes over here on her own. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=227.2s)]
*  So that's going to be a focus I think in the next couple of days, looking at the local [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=230.88s)]
*  response and the state response. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=234.79999999999998s)]
*  Why is it that some people might have gotten a warning and others, including those campers, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=237.23999999999998s)]
*  those girls, many of them have passed away. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=242.16s)]
*  Why didn't they get those warnings? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=243.79999999999998s)]
*  So there's still a lot of questions to be answered here, Matthew. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=244.79999999999998s)]
*  Yes, that is a very live political issue. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=247.44s)]
*  Carl Masman, thanks for the latest there from Texas. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSy--wxxrM4&t=250.20000000000002s)]
