# What Donald Trump could do in his first week as president | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw)
*  Are you guys prepared for the weather on Inauguration Day, which is going to be absolutely freezing? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm just looking forward to Bernie Sanders reprising his mittens. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  It's going to be an interesting day. I mean, what's for me, I think it's going to be so different [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=17.6s)]
*  from when he took office in 2017, right? I mean, that Inauguration Day was very much [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=24.0s)]
*  marked by his American carnage speech. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  This American carnage stops right here and stops right now. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=35.040000000000006s)]
*  There was a lot of people who were protesting. We saw those pink hats from all the women's march, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=42.96s)]
*  and it's a very different vibe in Washington this time around. It feels a lot more celebratory. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=51.44s)]
*  A lot of corporate America has shown up and poured millions of dollars into the Trump campaign, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=57.12s)]
*  the Trump Inaugural Committee. So I think it's going to be a very different vibe this year. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=67.12s)]
*  What do you guys think? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=72.0s)]
*  Oh, for sure. And the fact that you're also seeing this incredible lineup of tech CEOs. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  I know we've talked about the incoming administration's tech policy in the previous [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  pods, but the fact that you're going to have on the dais where President Trump is, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=80.64s)]
*  Sundar Pichai of Google and Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, that just goes to show [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=84.72s)]
*  how different this inauguration will be. And in fact, even the administration and the presidency [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=90.32s)]
*  too, when he was entering the office in 2017. And you do get the sense also that there's a bit of a [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=94.8s)]
*  muted attitude here in Washington, D.C. as well. Washington, D.C., a liberal city. And I wasn't [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=100.32s)]
*  here in 2016 into 2017. I know, Katrina, you were and Courtney as well. But it feels like the vibe [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=106.88s)]
*  itself of that resistance, if you will, to Donald Trump is very different, also in part because of [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=114.64s)]
*  his decisive victory in the election. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=122.88s)]
*  I think as well in 2017, you had in this city anyway, a whole pile of people who'd been here [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=124.88s)]
*  for eight years with the Obama administration. The Democrats were used to kind of running the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=131.12s)]
*  city for that length of time. They were so taken in shock, caught off guard by the election of [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=137.04s)]
*  Donald Trump that that upset and that anger was kind of coming from a place of surprise and shock. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=144.0s)]
*  Whereas this time around, the Democrats have only been here for four years under Joe Biden, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=149.68s)]
*  and they came in on the back of a Trump presidency. So the ten has been very mixed for those four [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=154.32s)]
*  years and the whole time that Joe Biden's been in office and definitely for the last two years [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=161.04s)]
*  anyway, Donald Trump has been there bubbling away, simmering away, very much a part of the scene, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=166.72s)]
*  not ceding the limelight or the control in kind of any way of the focus to the sitting president, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=173.68s)]
*  Joe Biden. So he's been part of the conversation in a way that he wasn't running into the 2017 [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=180.56s)]
*  inauguration, but I was on the Capitol steps that day. And again, it was a really cold day and I had [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=187.12s)]
*  all those hand warmers and foot warmers. But what we did see were a lot of protests, which I haven't [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=192.95999999999998s)]
*  heard as much about protests being organized this time around. And we saw a lot of scuffles. We saw [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=200.0s)]
*  a lot of people arrested. And actually the coverage in the days after the inauguration was about [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=206.79999999999998s)]
*  people appearing before courts, court hearings here for Democrats and anti-Trump protesters [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=211.68s)]
*  who had been arrested. And of course, we had that famous crowd size issue about how many people were [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=218.0s)]
*  on the National Mall. And we'll have to wait and see how many people will be here this time around. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=225.04000000000002s)]
*  I suspect there will be a lot more notwithstanding those below freezing temperatures. What do you [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=229.68s)]
*  guys think? I think you're right. I think there was this feeling of Donald Trump [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=235.76000000000002s)]
*  not only the Democrats being caught by surprise, but Donald Trump being caught by surprise. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=242.0s)]
*  And so he and his allies were very much political outsiders coming in the last time around. And this [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=246.88s)]
*  time there's dozens, there feels like dozens more parties that are being set up. There, as you said, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=256.16s)]
*  a laundry list of billionaires and tech CEOs coming in town for the event. And I think there [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=265.12s)]
*  is a confidence within the Trump transition team itself about how this day is going to go and how [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=274.15999999999997s)]
*  they're going to take office and what they're going to do on day one in a way that they didn't [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=283.44s)]
*  necessarily understand or comprehend the scope of what was happening when he was sworn into office. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=288.32s)]
*  We keep hearing that they're far more prepared for not only this term but also this inauguration. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=299.68s)]
*  And I think we'll probably see that reflected in Donald Trump's speech as well. You touch on [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=305.12s)]
*  the fact, Courtney, that that American carnage speech for his first inaugural address in 2017 [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=308.64s)]
*  was markedly seen as incredibly dark, a dark image of where the U.S. stood at the time. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=315.36s)]
*  And we've heard from so many people who have spoken to the president-elect since the election [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=321.44s)]
*  that he's in a very happy mood, that he feels confident, he feels that he's in a much better [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=326.40000000000003s)]
*  place because of that decisive victory in the election. And he's going to the day ahead of the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=330.40000000000003s)]
*  election, hold this massive rally here in Washington, D.C. as well, and a big basketball [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=336.56s)]
*  and sports arena in the center of the city. We're going to see people like Kid Rock performing and [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=341.04s)]
*  the village people. And I think that tone might perhaps be filtered through in the words that [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=346.40000000000003s)]
*  he delivers as well. We don't know for sure. And of course, some of the parts of the election [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=353.68s)]
*  campaign leading up to the election were dark in some of the rhetoric that we heard Donald Trump [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=358.24s)]
*  use. So it could be that that's not the case. But I don't know. What do you think, Katrina? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=361.84000000000003s)]
*  What are you expecting to hear him say in that inaugural address? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=366.16s)]
*  Well, I mean, the big question is going to be how long is he going to speak for as well, right? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=370.0s)]
*  Given those temperatures. I mean, I was looking this up before I came to talk to you guys. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=374.0s)]
*  In 2017, he spoke for around 17 minutes or so. Joe Biden spoke for around 20 minutes or so. Again, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=379.59999999999997s)]
*  it was very cold that day. But I mean, we know from Trump rallies that the average kind of Trump [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=387.28s)]
*  rally speech can be two hours or even longer. And obviously, he'll give that big speech on Sunday. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=392.4s)]
*  He hasn't held a rally for quite some time. So that will allow him to kind of deliver some of [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=398.8s)]
*  his points then. I think an inaugural address is a far more focused address. And that's what we [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=404.08s)]
*  heard from him the last time around. And interesting that American carnage speech that he gave. I mean, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=410.48s)]
*  we heard Joe Biden give his farewell address this week. And that was quite dark. That was [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=416.32s)]
*  uncharacteristically dark. Today, an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=421.28000000000003s)]
*  power and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy. Not naming anyone by name, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=427.68s)]
*  but it was quite clear that he was talking about Donald Trump and Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=432.88s)]
*  and all these guys. And about that kind of power balance between extremely wealthy individuals [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=437.44s)]
*  and people who have power over the technology that just dictates every part of our lives now. So [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=445.04s)]
*  I think we'll hear him, you know, try and state, set himself up on a presidential moment and kind [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=451.84s)]
*  of draw a line under some of that negativity that's gone on before now. And certainly, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=458.8s)]
*  it's a moment for him to also lay out what he sees as priorities for his presidency. And I've been [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=464.24s)]
*  thinking a lot about day one. Obviously, it's a critical milestone for any president when they [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=469.28s)]
*  enter office. And he had this experience once already. But it's an opportunity to put some of [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=473.36s)]
*  those promises that he made on the campaign trail into action with executive orders. So these are [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=478.32s)]
*  directives that a president can use to make binding policy without going through Congress. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=483.04s)]
*  There are executive actions as well, which we're expecting, which are more like rules and regulations. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=488.0s)]
*  But we've heard that Donald Trump spoke to Republican senators and said he wanted to [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=493.04s)]
*  issue 100 executive orders on day one. It could be day one, two and three, because 100 executive [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=499.44s)]
*  orders is quite a lot. And I look back at the last three terms. And in the first 100 days is [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=505.84s)]
*  usually what we take as a marker. And I see Donald Trump signed 33 executive orders in his first 100 [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=512.4s)]
*  days in 2017. President Biden signed 42 executive orders in that same period of time in 2021. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=517.76s)]
*  So again, 100 would be obviously blowing all of those numbers out of the water on a first day. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=524.4s)]
*  And I was listening to Steve Bannon speak at an event earlier this week where he was saying, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=529.68s)]
*  the first time around it was shock and awe, right? That President Trump would shock and awe all of [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=535.84s)]
*  us. This time I'm calling it days of thunder, because it's truly going to be a pace that we're [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=540.64s)]
*  not at all prepared for. But look, I mean, I don't know what you guys think, but the clear priorities [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=545.28s)]
*  that Donald Trump has set on day one is immigration. So deportation, closing the southern border, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=550.5600000000001s)]
*  revoking the ability for migrants to come in and claim refugee status, perhaps putting [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=556.32s)]
*  Title 42, that pandemic era restriction back in place. But Courtney, what do you think we're [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=562.08s)]
*  going to see on day one? Days of thunder, shock and awe? Yeah, I mean, I think you're right. I [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=567.2s)]
*  think immigration sort of takes the cake in terms of top priorities. He could declare a national [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=572.24s)]
*  emergency declaration in order to reroute money to funnel or to fund some of that bolstering of [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=579.6s)]
*  the border enforcement. We've also heard him talk about on day one wanting to impose tariffs on [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=588.56s)]
*  imported goods from Mexico and Canada. So I'd expect something along those lines as well. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=596.7199999999999s)]
*  But I think within those first few days, they definitely are coming to make a point and sort [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=604.4s)]
*  of shake things up. And I think part of that has also been staffing up at a faster clip than they [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=612.64s)]
*  did in the first term. And I think when he was sworn in, I think he had only something like 25 [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=620.4s)]
*  key posts named to his administration. And this time, I'm pretty sure it's more than 50 have [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=628.48s)]
*  already been named and they've already started hiring some of these lower level positions. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=636.72s)]
*  He's getting intimately involved in that hiring as well and conducting some of those interviews. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=642.24s)]
*  And part of that is just making sure that they're maybe a more well-oiled machine than they were in [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=650.4s)]
*  that first administration to try and enact some of these policy priorities right away. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=656.88s)]
*  Yeah, I totally agree with you there. I think I'm going to put my neck out here and say I think he [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=664.32s)]
*  can do 100 executive actions in those first couple of days. I think because a lot of people [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=669.12s)]
*  outside of President-elect Trump himself have been thinking about this moment for a long time. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=676.64s)]
*  There are Republican and conservative think tanks in this town and elsewhere who have, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=682.8s)]
*  they've told me they've drafted these memos well in advance of now. So it's a matter of copying [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=687.92s)]
*  and pasting essentially one of these memos into an executive action and Donald Trump putting his [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=693.84s)]
*  signature on it. I think he's made such a big deal of everything he's going to do on day one [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=698.88s)]
*  and he is a guy that tends to follow through on what he promises. He delivered on a lot of campaign [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=704.88s)]
*  promises the first time around. I expect we'll see that again. And there are a lot of things where [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=710.24s)]
*  he can get an easy win. So he can hit the media circuit, whether it's podcasts or the old-fashioned [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=715.04s)]
*  media like ourselves here at the BBC, although we are very flexible and agile and modern as well. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=721.04s)]
*  And he can actually claim credit for, look, I told you I was going to do something on immigration on [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=726.56s)]
*  day one. I did. In actual fact, I signed it in the Capitol building when I walked off the steps [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=732.64s)]
*  because there will be that signing ceremony, which is traditional now for presidents and [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=739.68s)]
*  they signed the various nominations and they can sign executive actions and [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=744.0799999999999s)]
*  memorandums at that point as well. So I think we'll see that. The question is signing executive [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=747.92s)]
*  actions and presidential memorandums is one thing. Translating it into action immediately [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=754.08s)]
*  is another thing and potentially takes other people. So the one that he, as you made the point [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=758.88s)]
*  there, assuming the kind of signature one about the mass deportations and the immigration, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=765.36s)]
*  we've heard from so many people working in that area that it's physically not possible to identify, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=770.0s)]
*  you know, arrest, detain and then deport those numbers of people on that one day. And we've [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=778.0s)]
*  even heard from President-elect Trump and some of the key people around him kind of row back that, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=785.04s)]
*  that it's not going to be every single person, that they're going to start with people who have [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=790.16s)]
*  criminal records and so on that are already in the system. But I do think he's, you know, he's a guy [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=795.76s)]
*  that likes superlatives. He likes wins. He likes big numbers. So we can expect that fast and furious [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=802.4s)]
*  type of vibe next week. Yeah, indeed. And he also likes that short-term return, doesn't he? And to [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=810.4s)]
*  your point, Katrina, some of the stuff will indeed take a bit longer. I mean, he's talked about [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=815.52s)]
*  bringing down prices for Americans. That was the driving issue for many voters in this election [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=819.4399999999999s)]
*  cycle. And in interviews after the election, he did say that it might not be possible to bring [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=825.04s)]
*  down those grocery prices. I think he said, you know, once they're up, it's hard to bring them back [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=831.36s)]
*  down. He's talked about eliminating some federal regulations as a way to go at those grocery prices. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=835.44s)]
*  But, you know, the effect of eliminating those regulations until they get to actually lowering [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=841.12s)]
*  prices, that's a much longer time period. So to your, both of your points, you know, he's going [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=845.84s)]
*  to be looking for some of those quick and easy victories. What I'm curious to see is, is one of [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=850.08s)]
*  the more controversial promises that he's made, which is to pardon some of those January 6 rioters [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=855.36s)]
*  that that's something he has promised. He's been questioned on this repeatedly. And he's kind of, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=861.84s)]
*  you know, been a bit vague about what he would do. He said, of course, he would pardon J-6ers. But [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=867.52s)]
*  when asked about those, for example, who had been involved in violence against Capitol Police [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=872.5600000000001s)]
*  officers, he hasn't exactly answered that. So I really wonder what we're going to see from him [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=876.16s)]
*  on that. And as you said, Katrina, there are people who have been working on some of these [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=881.36s)]
*  memorandums and orders for four years, literally since the last election. They believe that Donald [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=885.92s)]
*  Trump would be elected again. And that some of them would believe that he would lose the 2020 [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=891.28s)]
*  election, which we know is not the case. But very curious to see how quickly all of these get work [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=895.4399999999999s)]
*  through. It's, you know, it's interesting that you bring up the January 6 pardons as well, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=900.9599999999999s)]
*  because that's something that I had written down. Because I think this day, you know, is going to be [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=907.12s)]
*  so interesting in that it is part of his, you know, his plan to try and reshape the narrative [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=912.32s)]
*  around Donald Trump, right? There's a sense of vindication here that I think we'll get in the [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=922.88s)]
*  speech. But it's about sort of reclaiming his story, right? And it'll happen at the same time [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=927.2800000000001s)]
*  as we have Joe Biden, who is a man who staked his presidency on trying to abolish Donald Trump, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=935.6800000000001s)]
*  and now he's ending his presidency with Donald Trump's return to Washington. So this is, you [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=943.6800000000001s)]
*  know, you have these two competing narratives happening at the same time, these two men who are [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=948.88s)]
*  sort of, you know, connected in a way, their legacies are connected. And I think the January [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=953.28s)]
*  6 thing is a big part of that story, especially considering, you know, where the sentiment was in [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=961.12s)]
*  the Republican Party about Donald Trump just four years ago. And so, you know, with his return to [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=968.08s)]
*  the White House, I wonder if that's going to be one of the things we see first in those first couple [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=975.2s)]
*  of days. And I wonder, in fact, may he do that within the Capitol building in those minutes after, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=981.6s)]
*  because I mean, the symbolism of doing that in the place where, you know, those crimes were [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=988.24s)]
*  committed that those people have been convicted of, reversing that and pardoning those people in [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=994.64s)]
*  that place would be really so symbolic about, you know, trying to achieve what you're talking [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1000.32s)]
*  about, Courtney there. But you mentioned Joe Biden, and I know this is the path to the presidency, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1006.08s)]
*  but maybe let's talk about the path out of the presidency for a quick minute. And Joe Biden, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1011.28s)]
*  his last few days in office, not just as president, but in public office offices, he's held various [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1016.96s)]
*  offices for 50 years, Senator for 36 years, Vice President for eight, and now president for almost [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1023.9200000000001s)]
*  four. And he has said he will go to the inauguration, which we know Donald Trump didn't go to his [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1031.28s)]
*  inauguration. And he'll be there to witness that handover that transition, the peaceful transition [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1036.88s)]
*  of power. And then he and Jill and the outgoing, as she will be then, Vice President Kamala Harris [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1042.48s)]
*  and Doug Emhoff will go out the back door. It's usually done quite kind of discreetly and quietly, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1048.72s)]
*  isn't it? They go out there and get into a helicopter and then go to an airfield and get on [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1055.44s)]
*  an airplane and head off, usually for some sunshiny holiday and get out of Washington while [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1060.64s)]
*  their belongings are removed from their properties and the new families move in. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1066.24s)]
*  But I'm just wondering, you know, I've been thinking a lot, particularly this week as we had [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1071.6s)]
*  the speech from Joe Biden about what will he do next? Where will he go? He has spent almost, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1075.2s)]
*  so much anyway, of his adult life in elected office. And now he's facing into kind of the unknown. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1082.48s)]
*  And I think there's a sort of bitterness there too, as well, in terms of, you know, this isn't [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1090.24s)]
*  just him ending his presidency. This is the capstone to his career. This is his legacy of, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1096.24s)]
*  you know, five decades of service. And, you know, it ended in a way that I think he didn't [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1103.68s)]
*  expect or want it to. He was pressured by members of his own party to step down from [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1110.88s)]
*  the campaign. And I think he's spent the last, you know, remaining months, you know, trying to tie up [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1119.0400000000002s)]
*  some legacy pieces. He got the hostage deal that he wanted just in the nick of time. But I think [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1126.96s)]
*  he's also thinking about, you know, what will be said about him in the history books. And we heard [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1135.2s)]
*  a bit of that in his farewell speech. It will take time to feel the full impact of all we've [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1140.48s)]
*  done together. But the seeds are planted and they'll grow and they'll bloom for decades to come. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1146.08s)]
*  It didn't necessarily go the way he wanted, but I think he hoped that some of the legislative [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1152.8s)]
*  achievements and policy achievements will be felt later on. Some of those infrastructure projects [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1160.08s)]
*  that he sees as really key to America's future, things like replacing lead pipes and making sure [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1166.3999999999999s)]
*  there's broadband internet access across the country, that the effects of those will be felt [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1171.6s)]
*  down the road. And I'm sure he's hoping that he will be given credit for that down the road. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1175.76s)]
*  But it really strikes me what discord there is, often it seems, between President Biden and his [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1180.4s)]
*  image of his presidency and how the American people feel. You know, if you look at the polls, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1186.32s)]
*  ever since the withdrawal from Afghanistan, he's been a deeply unpopular president across the board. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1190.8799999999999s)]
*  And, you know, of course, he has had some support from Democrats. But as we went into this election [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1197.12s)]
*  year, we saw that support adding further and further away, in part and perhaps in large part, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1201.52s)]
*  because many Americans saw him as too old to be able to run. But I found it interesting, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1206.96s)]
*  I think it was last week that he had said in an interview that he still believed he would have [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1212.32s)]
*  beat Donald Trump in the election, and then said that he might not have been able to serve the [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1215.92s)]
*  entire term. So two contrasting thoughts there. But it does seem that the Bidens, and I would say [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1220.8s)]
*  the First Lady, Jill Biden as well, see his presidency as a great success in achieving some [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1226.48s)]
*  really progressive agenda items, what was wanted from in particular the progressive part of the [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1232.56s)]
*  Democrat Party, but also a platform that would serve everyday Americans as he had promised. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1238.56s)]
*  And yet he's leaving office with such low popularity levels. And, you know, both Democrats [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1244.08s)]
*  and Republicans perhaps looking back wishing things had been different. And if you speak to [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1249.2s)]
*  Democrats, they are, many of them, who I've spoken to anyway, are kind of angry with him, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1253.68s)]
*  that he didn't step aside earlier. Or, you know, I mean, he spoke when he came into office about [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1260.16s)]
*  being the bridge, you know, i.e. to the next generation, and he wasn't. And, you know, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1265.76s)]
*  trying to seek that second term until he stepped aside. A lot of Democrats feel that he's actually [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1272.4s)]
*  left the party in quite a weak position. They're kind of listing a bit. They don't have an [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1277.6000000000001s)]
*  obvious leader. They don't quite know how are they supposed to come up against President-elect [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1283.6s)]
*  Donald Trump and the Republicans on Capitol Hill. Are they supposed to have a hard resistance and [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1290.3999999999999s)]
*  say everything they do is terrible and awful and bad? Or are they supposed to try and co-exist with [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1296.3999999999999s)]
*  them and work with them and try and achieve some of those bipartisan issues that affect Americans [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1302.48s)]
*  of all persuasions in this country? And then at the end of the Donald Trump term that the Democrats [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1309.76s)]
*  will be able to say, you know, we did this with the Republicans. We're not all kind of negative [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1315.1200000000001s)]
*  about Donald Trump. And it's a question that they seem to be really battling with. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1321.92s)]
*  I think you hit the nail on the head. I mean, this weekend, there is actually a women's march, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1326.72s)]
*  which, as you guys remember, you know, eight years ago was a sort of watershed moment of defiance of [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1333.04s)]
*  Trump's election, right? There were, I think, 500,000 people convening on Washington. There [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1342.56s)]
*  were sister marches across the country, around the world. And you haven't heard really anything [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1348.0s)]
*  about it. It's actually been rebranded as the People's March, and it's involving a whole host [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1354.6399999999999s)]
*  of different organizations and activist groups, which I think just speaks to where the, you know, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1361.92s)]
*  so-called resistance movement is, which is sort of non-existent, right? And I think that also [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1369.6000000000001s)]
*  feeds into this point of where the party is in trying to figure out what's their unifying [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1376.88s)]
*  strategy. And I don't know if you guys saw the video that a group of senators put out last week, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1383.44s)]
*  but it was, it seemed to hit, strike a chord within the party where they sat down and they [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1389.76s)]
*  proclaimed, we are not here because of who we are against. We are here because of who we are for. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faq0Q1H6GVw&t=1397.6s)]
