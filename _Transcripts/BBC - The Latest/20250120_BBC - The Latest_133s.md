*  A court in India has handed down a life sentence to a police volunteer convicted of the rape [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5vRbuchLr0&t=0.0s)]
*  and murder of a junior doctor. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5vRbuchLr0&t=4.76s)]
*  The attack happened inside the hospital where the woman worked in Kolkata. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5vRbuchLr0&t=6.84s)]
*  The murder and rape outraged people in India and there have been rallies and protests. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5vRbuchLr0&t=10.92s)]
*  Our correspondent Samira Hussain is in Delhi following developments. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5vRbuchLr0&t=15.84s)]
*  Well, this is a case that happened back in August and what happened was there was a medical [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5vRbuchLr0&t=19.8s)]
*  trainee, a junior doctor, she's about 31 years old, and she was resting after a 36-hour shift. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5vRbuchLr0&t=27.04s)]
*  She was on this night shift and she went to take a rest in the seminar room. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5vRbuchLr0&t=35.72s)]
*  The next day her body, half naked and severely beaten, was found by a colleague. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5vRbuchLr0&t=40.4s)]
*  Eventually they found the person responsible. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5vRbuchLr0&t=48.0s)]
*  It was seen that she had actually been raped and murdered. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5vRbuchLr0&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  The police had arrested this gentleman, Sanjay Roy, who was a volunteer policeman working [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5vRbuchLr0&t=56.48s)]
*  at the hospital. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5vRbuchLr0&t=64.48s)]
*  But look, this is a case that really sparked an immense amount of outrage. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5vRbuchLr0&t=66.48s)]
*  For weeks and weeks doctors were on strike, not only at the hospital in Kolkata, but many [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5vRbuchLr0&t=71.4s)]
*  hospitals across the country. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5vRbuchLr0&t=77.24s)]
*  And so it really highlighted just the issue of safety for healthcare workers and specifically [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5vRbuchLr0&t=80.36s)]
*  health and safety for female workers. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5vRbuchLr0&t=86.16s)]
*  What has the reaction to the sentence been? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5vRbuchLr0&t=89.6s)]
*  Right, and so the reaction to the sentence has been quite mixed because many people were [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5vRbuchLr0&t=92.67999999999999s)]
*  advocating for the death penalty, which is legal here in India. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5vRbuchLr0&t=100.72s)]
*  But the judge opted instead for a life sentence. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5vRbuchLr0&t=106.44s)]
*  Now during the sentencing, Sanjay Roy was able to speak and he continues to maintain [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5vRbuchLr0&t=110.44000000000001s)]
*  his innocence, saying that look, that he is absolutely being framed for this, that he [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5vRbuchLr0&t=116.64s)]
*  is not responsible. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5vRbuchLr0&t=121.12s)]
*  Now we can't really go into why the judge opted for one sentence over another, but certainly [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5vRbuchLr0&t=122.88000000000001s)]
*  there were many people that were advocating certainly for the death penalty. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5vRbuchLr0&t=128.72s)]
