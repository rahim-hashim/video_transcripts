# Why did this week matter for Europe and the US? | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [February 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14i8lLJ0s5U)
*  For years, America and Europe have been in tandem. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14i8lLJ0s5U&t=0.0s)]
*  This week, that appeared to end. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14i8lLJ0s5U&t=3.68s)]
*  Donald Trump called President Zelensky a dictator and demanded Ukraine's minerals. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14i8lLJ0s5U&t=5.96s)]
*  His administration talked direct with Russia without involving Europe or Ukraine, declined [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14i8lLJ0s5U&t=10.24s)]
*  to confirm long-term security guarantees, and attacked Europe for censorship. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14i8lLJ0s5U&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  This week really matters in a range of ways. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14i8lLJ0s5U&t=20.04s)]
*  In recent decades, fewer conflicts have delivered what's known as a peace dividend, worth an [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14i8lLJ0s5U&t=23.6s)]
*  estimated $1.88 trillion. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14i8lLJ0s5U&t=28.18s)]
*  Not anymore. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14i8lLJ0s5U&t=31.3s)]
*  The EU says Europe needs a surge in defence. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14i8lLJ0s5U&t=32.3s)]
*  Sakia Stammer says we must increase our defence spending. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14i8lLJ0s5U&t=35.1s)]
*  Russia's invasion of Ukraine started this, but America turning away takes it further [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14i8lLJ0s5U&t=38.62s)]
*  and will inevitably impact spending across government. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14i8lLJ0s5U&t=43.42s)]
*  This week creates huge costs. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14i8lLJ0s5U&t=47.36s)]
*  It may also trigger further militarisation in Europe. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14i8lLJ0s5U&t=49.620000000000005s)]
*  The alliance NATO has members close to Russia. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14i8lLJ0s5U&t=52.94s)]
*  NATO's core principle is all for one and one for all, but will America honour this? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14i8lLJ0s5U&t=55.74s)]
*  After this week, some countries may not take the risk. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14i8lLJ0s5U&t=61.06s)]
*  Already, the frontrunner to be Germany's next leader wants to discuss whether nuclear [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14i8lLJ0s5U&t=64.46000000000001s)]
*  sharing could also apply to us. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14i8lLJ0s5U&t=68.7s)]
*  In other words, France and the UK offering nuclear security to Germany. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14i8lLJ0s5U&t=71.36s)]
*  This week matters to the global principle of respecting sovereignty and territory. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14i8lLJ0s5U&t=75.88s)]
*  Here's Donald Trump on Ukraine. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14i8lLJ0s5U&t=80.58s)]
*  A half-baked negotiator could have settled this years ago without, I think, without the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14i8lLJ0s5U&t=83.14s)]
*  loss of much land, very little land. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14i8lLJ0s5U&t=90.58s)]
*  Previously, President Trump has also said of Russia, they took a lot of land and they [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14i8lLJ0s5U&t=93.18s)]
*  fought for that land. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14i8lLJ0s5U&t=97.26s)]
*  If the US accepts Russia taking Ukrainian land, what might Putin do next? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14i8lLJ0s5U&t=99.62s)]
*  And after comments on owning Gaza after this week, what might America do next? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14i8lLJ0s5U&t=104.86s)]
*  This week also matters because it's not just about policy, it's a deep fracture. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14i8lLJ0s5U&t=111.58s)]
*  In a speech to Europe's military elite, US Vice President JD Vance took aim, condemning [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14i8lLJ0s5U&t=116.02s)]
*  the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14i8lLJ0s5U&t=121.02s)]
*  United States. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14i8lLJ0s5U&t=125.36s)]
*  A sense of common cause decades long now feels badly strained. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14i8lLJ0s5U&t=126.86s)]
*  And with reference to the Second World War, the journalist Anne Applebaum calls it the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14i8lLJ0s5U&t=132.92s)]
*  end of the post-war world. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14i8lLJ0s5U&t=137.12s)]
*  Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping have long wanted to upturn the West, to create [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14i8lLJ0s5U&t=139.82s)]
*  a new world order. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14i8lLJ0s5U&t=145.3s)]
*  It seems President Trump wants a new world order too, and it appears it's one that involves [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14i8lLJ0s5U&t=146.86s)]
*  America and Europe taking quite different paths. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14i8lLJ0s5U&t=151.98s)]
*  This week will matter for years to come. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14i8lLJ0s5U&t=155.96s)]
