Video Description: Newly-released mobile phone footage shows the moment Israeli soldiers opened fired on a convoy of ambulances in Gaza,  killing 15 rescue workers.   The video contradicts the Israel Defence Forces account of the incident, in which they claimed the vehicles had been travelling without headlights or emergency flashing lights and appeared to be a threat.

The video, released by the Palestine Red Crescent Society shows the clearly-marked ambulances with headlights and emergency flashing lights switched on. The PRCS said the video was obtained from the phone of a paramedic who was killed in the Israeli attack. 

In response to the new video, the IDF told the BBC: "All claims, including the documentation circulating about the incident, will be thoroughly and deeply examined to understand the sequence of events and the handling of the situation".

The video shows the marked vehicles drawing to a halt on the edge of the road, lights still flashing, and at least two emergency workers stepping out wearing reflective clothing.  Shooting can then be heard lasting for several minutes as the man filming says prayers.

The footage was found on his phone after his body was recovered from a shallow grave one week after the incident. The bodies of the eight paramedics, six Gaza Civil Defence workers and one United Nations employee were found buried in sand, along with their wrecked vehicles. It took international organisations days to negotiate safe access to the site.

Israel claimed a number of Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants had been killed in the shooting, but has not provided any evidence for that claim or explained the alleged threat to its troops.

# New video shows Israeli soldiers shooting dead 15 emergency workers in Gaza | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [April 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajBouTY-45c)
*  An attack two weeks ago on 15 rescue workers in Gaza by Israeli soldiers provoked international [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajBouTY-45c&t=0.0s)]
*  outrage. Now mobile phone footage has emerged that has forced Israel to change its account [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajBouTY-45c&t=7.2s)]
*  of the circumstances under which its soldiers opened fire. The rescue workers were travelling [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajBouTY-45c&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  in a convoy which Israel's military had said approached suspiciously and without lights. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajBouTY-45c&t=18.48s)]
*  But the footage shows the convoy did have headlights on and emergency lights flashing. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajBouTY-45c&t=24.28s)]
*  Tonight Israel has admitted the soldiers were mistaken about the lights and the threat they [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajBouTY-45c&t=29.88s)]
*  were under. You may find footage of the video in Dan Johnson's report Distressing. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajBouTY-45c&t=34.36s)]
*  This video challenges Israel's account of why its soldiers opened fire with such deadly [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajBouTY-45c&t=40.96s)]
*  force. It's just before dawn and the Red Crescent paramedics and civil defence workers [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajBouTY-45c&t=46.2s)]
*  are answering a call to help the wounded near Raffa. Israel's military first said this convoy [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajBouTY-45c&t=51.599999999999994s)]
*  advanced suspiciously towards troops with the lights switched off. But you can see these [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajBouTY-45c&t=57.48s)]
*  are marked vehicles and they're wearing reflective uniforms. Then without warning this. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajBouTY-45c&t=63.2s)]
*  The shooting continues for more than five minutes. The paramedic who's filming says [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajBouTY-45c&t=70.68s)]
*  his last prayers. Raffat Redwan was one of 15 killed. His phone was found with his body [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajBouTY-45c&t=79.96s)]
*  and he recorded the whole event. His last words before being shot. Forgive me mum. I [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajBouTY-45c&t=91.19999999999999s)]
*  just wanted to help people. I wanted to save lives. The footage only emerged when teams [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajBouTY-45c&t=104.12s)]
*  could safely reach this site seven days later. The bodies were buried along with the vehicles. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajBouTY-45c&t=111.2s)]
*  Regular practice the army says to protect them from animals. The UN called this a mass [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajBouTY-45c&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  grave. Israel's account was already in question. The only paramedic to live through the shooting [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajBouTY-45c&t=122.92s)]
*  told us earlier this week they had their lights on and it was clear they were medics. I am the [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajBouTY-45c&t=129.36s)]
*  only survivor who saw what happened to my colleagues and I will expose the crimes committed by the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajBouTY-45c&t=136.68s)]
*  occupation against them. On Tuesday Israel's response was in defense of its forces. The IDF [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajBouTY-45c&t=141.52s)]
*  did not randomly attack an ambulance. Last Sunday several uncoordinated vehicles were identified [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajBouTY-45c&t=148.36s)]
*  advancing suspiciously toward IDF troops without headlights. Now that narrative's been upended. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajBouTY-45c&t=158.24s)]
*  Tonight a military official admitted the soldiers were mistaken about the lights and the threats [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajBouTY-45c&t=168.0s)]
*  they were under. The army insists six of the dead belonged to Hamas but it denies they were executed [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajBouTY-45c&t=174.0s)]
*  at close range. The changing story though is only increasing the pressure for an independent [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajBouTY-45c&t=180.24s)]
*  investigation. This footage lay buried for a week in the Gaza sand. Now it is forcing Israel to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajBouTY-45c&t=185.92s)]
*  give answers and adding to the cause for accountability. Dan Johnson, BBC News in Jerusalem. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajBouTY-45c&t=192.39999999999998s)]
