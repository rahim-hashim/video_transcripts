*  This is BBC News. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says 45 people have been killed at an [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3cD4uN9Dsg&t=0.0s)]
*  incident near an aid distribution centre in southern Gaza on Monday. It happened not far [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3cD4uN9Dsg&t=6.08s)]
*  from Khan Yunis, an area which has seen several weeks of ongoing Israeli military operations. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3cD4uN9Dsg&t=11.92s)]
*  Witnesses are reporting that Israeli forces opened fire using drones and a tank. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3cD4uN9Dsg&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  The Israeli military has not yet commented on the incident. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3cD4uN9Dsg&t=23.2s)]
*  Let's speak to our Gaza correspondent Rushdie Abou-Alouf who is in Cairo. Rushdie, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3cD4uN9Dsg&t=27.52s)]
*  what do we know about this incident? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3cD4uN9Dsg&t=33.68s)]
*  Yeah, so far we know that thousands of people gathered near a warehouse belonging to the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3cD4uN9Dsg&t=38.56s)]
*  World Food Programme in Khan Yunis and there is another community kitchen near the place to [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3cD4uN9Dsg&t=45.28s)]
*  collect aid. About five, six hours ago there was reports of Israeli drone attack in the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3cD4uN9Dsg&t=53.2s)]
*  crowd followed by Israeli tank shell in the area. Witnesses said that they haven't seen Israeli [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3cD4uN9Dsg&t=61.04s)]
*  tanks in the place but we are aware that there is ongoing Israeli military operation in a nearby [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3cD4uN9Dsg&t=68.16s)]
*  town called Bani Suhailah about 400 or 500 meters away from that centre. The images and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3cD4uN9Dsg&t=74.16s)]
*  videos coming out of the only operating hospital in Khan Yunis show the total catastrophic [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3cD4uN9Dsg&t=82.48s)]
*  situation inside the hospital as the doctors are treating people in the corridors of the hospitals. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3cD4uN9Dsg&t=88.32000000000001s)]
*  They have to transfer about 50 injured people in the back of a truck to about 10 kilometres north [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3cD4uN9Dsg&t=94.56s)]
*  to another hospital called Al-Aqsa in Deir el-Balh because they don't have a place for them, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3cD4uN9Dsg&t=102.16s)]
*  about 200 people. The latest number from the Hamas run health ministry said 51 bodies were [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3cD4uN9Dsg&t=108.8s)]
*  counted and about 200 people were injured. Already funerals are everywhere in Khan Yunis [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3cD4uN9Dsg&t=115.2s)]
*  and other places for those killed earlier this morning. Just remind us what is the aid [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3cD4uN9Dsg&t=120.56s)]
*  distribution system and status right now? Well, I was speaking this morning to the guy who's [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3cD4uN9Dsg&t=126.88s)]
*  a coordinator for most of the institution that dealing with the aid and they said what has been [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3cD4uN9Dsg&t=138.32s)]
*  allowed from Israel since they resume the aid is nothing near enough for the people. He said while [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3cD4uN9Dsg&t=144.16s)]
*  the focus is in Iran-Israel escalation, it's another day of war, death and more starvation [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3cD4uN9Dsg&t=152.23999999999998s)]
*  in Gaza. Talking to people every day we have seen people killed near [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3cD4uN9Dsg&t=161.04s)]
*  centers that distribute food. Yesterday about 20 people killed, a day before 23 people killed and [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3cD4uN9Dsg&t=168.0s)]
*  today we have seen 51 in Khan Yunis, about three people in Rafah and two people in the middle camps. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3cD4uN9Dsg&t=173.68s)]
*  So people are starving. When I did ask some of the people why you are risking your life [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3cD4uN9Dsg&t=180.32s)]
*  and going to near Israeli control area, they said because our kids are starving and we have no other [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3cD4uN9Dsg&t=185.52s)]
*  solution. So either to wait and die from hunger or to go and to be killed in a combat zone. This is [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3cD4uN9Dsg&t=191.52s)]
*  what most of the people in Gaza are saying and they feel that since the escalation between [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3cD4uN9Dsg&t=198.48s)]
*  Iran and Israel started, all the focus is there and Gaza's people feel that they are abandoned by [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3cD4uN9Dsg&t=205.76s)]
*  the new development between Israel and Iran. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3cD4uN9Dsg&t=212.64s)]
