**BBC - The Latest:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppyKt8934GA)
*  Just days after a Russian attack in the Ukrainian city of Sumy killed 35 people and injured 117 others. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppyKt8934GA&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump has blamed Volodymyr Zelenskyy for starting the war with Russia. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppyKt8934GA&t=7.8s)]
*  The comments follow widespread outrage over the attack on Sumy Sunday, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppyKt8934GA&t=12.4s)]
*  which was the deadliest Russian attack on civilians this year. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppyKt8934GA&t=16.36s)]
*  The US president said of the Ukraine president, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppyKt8934GA&t=19.76s)]
*  you don't start a war against someone 20 times your size and then hope that people give you some missiles. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppyKt8934GA&t=22.56s)]
*  He's always looking to purchase missiles, you know, he's against. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppyKt8934GA&t=29.52s)]
*  Listen, when you start a war, you got to know that you can win the war, right? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppyKt8934GA&t=32.92s)]
*  You don't start a war against somebody that's 20 times your size and then hope that people give you some missiles. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppyKt8934GA&t=36.84s)]
*  Trump, they're speaking just yesterday. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppyKt8934GA&t=44.56s)]
*  Let's talk to Victoria Vadovichenko, program director for security studies at the Ukraine Center for Defense Strategies, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppyKt8934GA&t=46.2s)]
*  before we even talk about the way that Donald Trump is referring to Russia's full scale invasion of Ukraine. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppyKt8934GA&t=53.12s)]
*  Just help us to understand how important these Patriot air defense systems, these missiles are. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppyKt8934GA&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  Indeed, that's the first important understanding that this kind of the air defense system not only are used for the protection of the civilians, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppyKt8934GA&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  but at present, this is the component of the American system that cannot be replaced for a moment by the European allies and partners. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppyKt8934GA&t=73.88s)]
*  So therefore, President Zelensky was proposing actually to purchase 10 Patriot system. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppyKt8934GA&t=81.6s)]
*  It's a minimum quantity because we definitely need much more from the United States with Ukrainian money and the help of the European partners, let's say funds in particular sense. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppyKt8934GA&t=87.44s)]
*  So therefore, the questions that was rejected by the president Trump and saying that Volodymyr Zelensky started the war was very much, of course, said. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppyKt8934GA&t=98.32s)]
*  But at the same time, an unimaginable pain caused for Ukrainian civilian and Ukrainian specifically from Sumy region. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppyKt8934GA&t=109.8s)]
*  It's very hard for them to explain this kind of the rhetoric that's being presented here. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppyKt8934GA&t=118.36s)]
*  However, it's very also important to understand that not only the Patriot system is something that we have to talk about, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppyKt8934GA&t=124.36s)]
*  because currently Russian Federation is launching so-called combination of something that happened this morning, for example, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppyKt8934GA&t=131.88s)]
*  in the surrounding regions when the FPV or first person view drones were being very much used. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppyKt8934GA&t=138.44s)]
*  We definitely understand as the experts. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppyKt8934GA&t=144.84s)]
*  So with the future of whatever warfare we are talking about in the end, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppyKt8934GA&t=146.72s)]
*  it's not only in the acquiring of the Patriot air defense system that we definitely need now for the protection of, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppyKt8934GA&t=151.04s)]
*  let's say, not only critical infrastructure, but mostly the largest city with this big civilian population, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppyKt8934GA&t=158.12s)]
*  but at the same time, the production of our defense systems, in particular, when we're talking about the drone. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppyKt8934GA&t=163.88s)]
*  And that's something that Ukraine is still not only advocating, but still already presented the progress and advancement for all of the European partners. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppyKt8934GA&t=170.16s)]
*  So it's very important in understanding that once we are talking about, let's say, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppyKt8934GA&t=178.92000000000002s)]
*  diplomatic, let's say, referring to Mr. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppyKt8934GA&t=185.0s)]
*  Diplomatic affairs with the Russian Federation. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppyKt8934GA&t=189.72s)]
*  Still, unfortunately, Ukrainian people are dying. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppyKt8934GA&t=192.79999999999998s)]
*  And it's nothing about the diplomacy in all when we're talking about the protection of the civilians, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppyKt8934GA&t=195.84s)]
*  which is under the violation of international humanitarian law for a moment. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppyKt8934GA&t=200.76s)]
*  Victoria, we have to leave it there, but we hear you loud and clear. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppyKt8934GA&t=206.24s)]
*  Victoria Dovichenko from the Ukraine Center for Defense Strategies Organization. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppyKt8934GA&t=208.92s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppyKt8934GA&t=214.72s)]
*  Joining us live from Kiev. Thank you. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppyKt8934GA&t=215.51999999999998s)]
