# Clair Obscur: Expedition 33: Ben Starr and Jennifer English interview | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [April 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q)
*  We were in Montpellier, visiting the studio, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=0.0s)]
*  when Lorian pulled me aside and said, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=2.6s)]
*  I have an idea for this song, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  would you like to be a part of it? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=6.2s)]
*  I'm not gonna lie, I was drunk. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=7.4s)]
*  And I went, of course Lorian, I will. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=9.4s)]
*  ["I'm Not a Coward"] [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=12.8s)]
*  We're gonna take down the patients, just the three of us? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=22.2s)]
*  I didn't take you for a coward. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  I'm not a coward. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=26.0s)]
*  So the game is an RPG with modern graphics, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=27.4s)]
*  and the concept of the story itself is that [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=31.799999999999997s)]
*  it takes place in the Belle Epoque of France, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=34.6s)]
*  which is the early 20th century, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=36.0s)]
*  in France in a distorted version of Paris. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=38.2s)]
*  And the concept of the story is that [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=40.8s)]
*  everybody in the world lives in a city called Lumière, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=43.0s)]
*  which is an island version of Paris, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=46.4s)]
*  and in the end of the world you see the giant monolith [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=48.4s)]
*  with a number on it. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=51.0s)]
*  And every year the Pinterest, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=52.0s)]
*  which is a big entity living at the bottom of the monolith, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=53.599999999999994s)]
*  wakes up, repaints a number, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=56.0s)]
*  and it goes down by one each year. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=57.6s)]
*  And every time she paints this number, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=59.4s)]
*  people of that age disappear. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=61.0s)]
*  So people disappear younger and younger, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=62.8s)]
*  and you are sent as an expedition [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=64.8s)]
*  to try to reach the Pinterest, destroy her, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=66.4s)]
*  so she cannot paint a number down anymore. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=68.6s)]
*  Beautifully, Sinclair loved it. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=70.6s)]
*  So tell us about Sandfall, how big is that team? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=73.0s)]
*  So we are quite a small team. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=77.0s)]
*  We are mainly based in Montpellier, in the south of France, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=79.0s)]
*  and we are around 30 people now, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=81.6s)]
*  which is a very small team compared to what we are trying to achieve. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=83.6s)]
*  So that's something that struck me from the game, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=87.6s)]
*  like it is so beautiful, but with such a small team, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=89.6s)]
*  how did you achieve that? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=93.0s)]
*  I think it's two things mainly. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=95.6s)]
*  First, there have been some big technological breakthroughs [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=97.6s)]
*  in the industry with Unreal Engine 5, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  MetaHuman, some procedural generation stuff [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=103.39999999999999s)]
*  that we heavily used, even MoCAP and everything, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=106.0s)]
*  that allowed us to be smart enough about the tools we used [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=108.6s)]
*  to be able to achieve that. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=112.8s)]
*  And also, the main component is probably the team. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=114.39999999999999s)]
*  We have, I think, an amazing team, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=117.39999999999999s)]
*  mostly of junior people, actually, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=119.8s)]
*  but they are so incredibly invested in the project [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=122.2s)]
*  and talented that somehow it worked, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=124.8s)]
*  which still makes no sense to me after all these years. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=127.6s)]
*  I think also another aspect of that [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=130.0s)]
*  is that everybody wears a lot of different hats, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=132.2s)]
*  and so we all pitch in and do different parts, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=134.8s)]
*  things that may be outside of our traditional role, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=138.8s)]
*  and I think that's something that the team does extraordinarily well. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=142.2s)]
*  I mean, you wear like 40,000 hats yourself. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=145.0s)]
*  Yeah, but Jen too, like she was a writer in the beginning, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=147.2s)]
*  then nobody was here to do the localization, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=150.39999999999998s)]
*  and, well, I'll do it. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=152.39999999999998s)]
*  It builds up like this, like we need something, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=153.79999999999998s)]
*  and someone's like, yeah, I'll do it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=157.0s)]
*  And someone's like, all right, and somebody steps up and does it, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=158.2s)]
*  and I think that's true for the entire team, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=160.39999999999998s)]
*  and so that's how we stretch our resources. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=162.79999999999998s)]
*  There's been a lot of discussion recently about the price of games [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=165.39999999999998s)]
*  off the back of Nintendo Switch 2 announcement, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=168.0s)]
*  and this game is not only going to be on Game Pass, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=171.20000000000002s)]
*  but it's also listed for around £40 for the standard edition in the UK. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=173.60000000000002s)]
*  How are you able to make something that looks like this so affordable? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=178.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think it comes down to your previous question [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=181.8s)]
*  of how do you make something with a team so small. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=184.0s)]
*  Like, we are not a big game, despite what it looks like. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=186.20000000000002s)]
*  Like, we are still like the first game from a new studio, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=190.60000000000002s)]
*  based in France, we're like 30 people. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=193.8s)]
*  So we wanted to reflect that also on the pricing, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=195.8s)]
*  and I know that prices are going up, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=198.60000000000002s)]
*  and to be honest, it's kind of a weird side effect of like, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=200.6s)]
*  we are included in the debate with Nintendo [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=204.2s)]
*  announcing their game, like, being higher priced. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=205.79999999999998s)]
*  But definitely, like, we wanted the players who buy this game [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=209.2s)]
*  to know that it's a small team behind it, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=212.2s)]
*  and it really reflects our values also, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=214.4s)]
*  like, we want as many people to discover the game as possible, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=216.6s)]
*  which is also why we are on Game Pass. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=219.0s)]
*  So, like, it's our first game, and I think the best way to, like, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=222.4s)]
*  really make a big impact on the industry when you're new [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=227.4s)]
*  is to have as many people play the game as possible, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=230.4s)]
*  so that was what we did that for. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=232.8s)]
*  Ben, I've heard that you do a little bit of singing in this game. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=235.4s)]
*  Have you? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=238.8s)]
*  I have heard this. Is it true? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=239.6s)]
*  It is true. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=241.20000000000002s)]
*  Could you do a little bit for us now? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=242.20000000000002s)]
*  I'm not going to, because I want to hear. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=243.4s)]
*  This is the first time I've been asked that question. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=246.4s)]
*  It is, yes. I do do some singing in this game. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=248.6s)]
*  How do you feel about it? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=251.4s)]
*  I love it. I love being outside of my comfort zone. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=252.4s)]
*  I also think it feels right for what it is [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=255.0s)]
*  that we're trying to achieve with the song. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=258.4s)]
*  It's not just Verso breaking out into song. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=259.6s)]
*  I think there is something incredibly beautiful about why it exists. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=261.8s)]
*  And we were in Montpellier, visiting the studio, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=265.0s)]
*  when Lorian pulled me aside and said, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=268.20000000000005s)]
*  I have an idea for this song. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=269.40000000000003s)]
*  Would you like to be a part of it? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=271.8s)]
*  And I'm not going to lie, I was drunk. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=273.0s)]
*  And I went, of course, Lorian, I will. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=275.8s)]
*  And then I kind of reckoned with what that was. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=280.20000000000005s)]
*  And my first ever professional job was playing Gavroche [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=282.8s)]
*  in the national touring company of Les Miserables. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=286.40000000000003s)]
*  And I, but I haven't really kept it up. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=289.0s)]
*  So to do that and to kind of place myself outside of that comfort zone, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=291.2s)]
*  it was really, really cool. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=296.0s)]
*  And I can't really say much else from that. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=297.40000000000003s)]
*  It's fun to do it. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=299.40000000000003s)]
*  I think it feels right. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=302.40000000000003s)]
*  And also, it's really exciting. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=303.8s)]
*  I hope people enjoy my voice. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=305.6s)]
*  People are going to lose their minds. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=307.2s)]
*  It's beautiful. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=308.6s)]
*  It's beautiful. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=310.2s)]
*  I'll sing a little song for you. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=311.2s)]
*  He sings it incredibly. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=312.6s)]
*  Please, I'll sing a little song for you. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=314.0s)]
*  How dare you be that talented? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=315.40000000000003s)]
*  That is disgusting. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=317.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=318.79999999999995s)]
*  So yeah, do you want me to sing some now? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=319.79999999999995s)]
*  I mean, if you'd like to. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=321.0s)]
*  There is a castle on a cloud. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=322.0s)]
*  That's the latest. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=324.59999999999997s)]
*  That's the latest. And you didn't play cassette, you played Gavroche. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=325.59999999999997s)]
*  I always sing it to you, but you played Gavroche. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=328.0s)]
*  I also played Gavroche in a school production. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=330.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=332.59999999999997s)]
*  That's, but we are Gavroche. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=333.4s)]
*  The Gavroche to Expedition, because you throw your pipe light, is strong. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=335.2s)]
*  So people get excited these days when they realize an actor that they love [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=339.2s)]
*  is in something or coming into a game that they're excited about. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=343.2s)]
*  Is this something that you've both noticed more? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=347.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=349.8s)]
*  It's a bit wild. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=350.8s)]
*  That's silly, isn't it? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=352.0s)]
*  It's very silly. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=353.0s)]
*  Well, Clive was your kind of first big game, right? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=353.8s)]
*  And Shadowheart was mine. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=358.6s)]
*  And so that and that, those were only released. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=360.0s)]
*  What? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=363.4s)]
*  My favorite thing is when the trailers first came out [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=364.2s)]
*  and they recognized mine and your voices. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=366.8s)]
*  And I kept seeing like people go, Clive, my beloved, Shadowheart, my beloved. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=368.4s)]
*  And we're like, shh, you're not supposed to know. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=373.2s)]
*  You weren't supposed to recognize our voices. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=375.0s)]
*  It's great because, again, people are going to come to this game [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=377.4s)]
*  because they want to play a brilliantly realized world by an amazing team [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=380.0s)]
*  of people who are passionate about making this game. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=383.4s)]
*  But also, some people are going to play it because they love you. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=385.2s)]
*  Yeah, and they love you. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=388.8s)]
*  Yeah, and they don't just, also, I think you've done such an amazing job [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=390.2s)]
*  of not just kind of taking Shadowheart as a character, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=392.8s)]
*  but getting people to know you as a performer. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=395.2s)]
*  I think that is so rare because actors often are seen as those roles [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=397.4s)]
*  and how you can figure out a way of taking your performance [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=402.6s)]
*  and presenting yourself as a person that people can trust in. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=407.40000000000003s)]
*  And if you're in something, you're going to bring a level of dynamism [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=410.8s)]
*  to the performance, which you absolutely do in this game. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=414.20000000000005s)]
*  Thank you. Well, same. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=416.8s)]
*  I think we both wanted that. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=417.8s)]
*  Like, we don't want to just be known as Shadowheart and Clive. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=419.40000000000003s)]
*  And of course we will do. And there's nothing wrong with that. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=423.40000000000003s)]
*  And we would not be offended by that if that were the case. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=425.6s)]
*  But we are reasonably cool human beings outside of that. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=429.0s)]
*  That's why I dress up like a way clown sometimes. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=434.0s)]
*  So, Jen, I have to ask. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=436.2s)]
*  So you have said that people told you you'd be a perfect fit for Zelda in a live action. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=437.4s)]
*  You would. Have they? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=442.0s)]
*  Yes. Has there been any movement on that front? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=444.2s)]
*  I know, but I would... [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=446.6s)]
*  That is, I mean, that is the dream, right? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=448.8s)]
*  I would love to play... Yeah, there we go. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=451.8s)]
*  So people often ask you your dream roles. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=454.2s)]
*  I'm always like, no, I don't really have any. That's fine. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=456.6s)]
*  Zelda. Zelda. It would be Zelda. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=459.40000000000003s)]
*  But I know Patricia Somerset, who voices Zelda. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=461.8s)]
*  And she is... She's quite a good Zelda. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=464.8s)]
*  She's an amazing Zelda, funnily enough. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=466.6s)]
*  She is literally Zelda. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=468.40000000000003s)]
*  And also one of the coolest humans around. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=469.40000000000003s)]
*  So, you know, but yeah. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=471.8s)]
*  I'm excited. I am very intrigued to see who they would cast. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=474.40000000000003s)]
*  I've seen a lot of Hunter Schafer. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=478.6s)]
*  I was going to say, I thought Hunter Schafer would be brilliant. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=481.20000000000005s)]
*  But she's wonderful. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=484.40000000000003s)]
*  I think that is such a beloved franchise [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=485.6s)]
*  and I look forward to seeing it when it comes out. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=488.40000000000003s)]
*  So that's your dream live action game remake. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=491.20000000000005s)]
*  Why not? What would your dream character... [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=493.8s)]
*  My dream live action remake? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=495.6s)]
*  Where you are the star. Which one is it? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=497.8s)]
*  Listen, I'm already the live action version of it, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=503.6s)]
*  but I really want to go dark and gritty. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=506.6s)]
*  I want a proper, like, almost terrifying, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=508.40000000000003s)]
*  terrifyingly psychotic film version of Ballad Trove. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=512.0s)]
*  And I want to take Jimbo that we've already built [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=514.4s)]
*  and make him tragic and terrifying in the same way. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=517.6s)]
*  So, yeah. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=520.1999999999999s)]
*  That sounds awesome. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=521.1999999999999s)]
*  I'm already living my live action dream, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=522.1999999999999s)]
*  which is the horrific human incarnation of Jimbo. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=524.0s)]
*  Those photos will haunt my dreams forever. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=529.6s)]
*  They are quite haunting. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=532.6s)]
*  They are haunting. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=533.6s)]
*  I forgot that I was wearing the make-up. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=534.6s)]
*  Well, yeah, you're not looking at yourself. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=536.8s)]
*  No. And yeah, so I would love to do that, please. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=538.4s)]
*  So can someone just make that? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=542.1999999999999s)]
*  Make it happen, babes. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=543.8s)]
*  Great. Yeah, so is Zelda Jimbo. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=544.8s)]
*  Jimbo. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=546.5999999999999s)]
*  Zelda Jimbo. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=547.5999999999999s)]
*  Maybe a crossover. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=548.5999999999999s)]
*  Ooh, that could be very spooky. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=549.5999999999999s)]
*  That's actually all of my questions. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=552.5999999999999s)]
*  Thank you so much for your time today. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=554.5999999999999s)]
*  Love the game and, yeah, good luck with everything. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=556.5999999999999s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=559.5999999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlbWuTNwr5Q&t=560.5999999999999s)]
