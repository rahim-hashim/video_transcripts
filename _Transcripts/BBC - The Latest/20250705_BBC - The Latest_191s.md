Video Description: A major search and rescue operation has continued through the night in Texas after flash floods killed at least 24 people and left many girls missing from a Christian summer camp.
 
Rescue crews are still searching for up to 25 children who were among the 750 girls attending the Camp Mystic just outside the town of Kerrville 104km (64 miles) north-west of San Antonio.
 
There was little warning as the Guadalupe River rose 26 feet (7.9m) in less than an hour and flooding that followed swept away mobile homes, vehicles and holiday cabins.
 
A state of emergency has been declared in several counties where several roads have been washed away and phone lines are down.

*  Our North America correspondent, Peter Bowes, has the report. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1QVYV5a544&t=20.36s)]
*  A holiday weekend nightmare in the heart of Texas. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1QVYV5a544&t=23.96s)]
*  This is Guadalupe River in Kerr County. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1QVYV5a544&t=28.12s)]
*  During torrential rain it burst its banks, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1QVYV5a544&t=31.12s)]
*  sweeping away property, mobile homes, vehicles and people. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1QVYV5a544&t=33.56s)]
*  Catastrophic destruction as far as the eye can see. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1QVYV5a544&t=38.52s)]
*  And it all happened in minutes. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1QVYV5a544&t=42.2s)]
*  Officials say weather forecasts gave no indication [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1QVYV5a544&t=44.32s)]
*  that such a severe storm was moving into the area. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1QVYV5a544&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  On a day which is usually for celebration, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1QVYV5a544&t=51.48s)]
*  it's a very tough day in Texas. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1QVYV5a544&t=57.28s)]
*  We had a disastrous flash flood [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1QVYV5a544&t=60.56s)]
*  that hit somewhere around four in the morning. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1QVYV5a544&t=68.28s)]
*  The rain came down 12 inches or more per hour. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1QVYV5a544&t=73.68s)]
*  That river rose 26 feet in 45 minutes. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1QVYV5a544&t=79.12s)]
*  It was a dry bed. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1QVYV5a544&t=86.32s)]
*  It had been dry. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1QVYV5a544&t=88.84s)]
*  There wasn't a lot to absorb it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1QVYV5a544&t=90.44s)]
*  It went down the rocks. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1QVYV5a544&t=91.92s)]
*  And it was a destructive flood, taking property and sadly lives. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1QVYV5a544&t=94.03999999999999s)]
*  A frantic search has been underway for several hours [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1QVYV5a544&t=101.28s)]
*  for at least 20 girls who'd been at a summer camp [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1QVYV5a544&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  with about 750 other children when the downpour started. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1QVYV5a544&t=107.28s)]
*  We will rescue those in peril and we will find those who are missing. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1QVYV5a544&t=112.44s)]
*  But I'd also ask, please pray for our community. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1QVYV5a544&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  This is a hard day and there will be hard days to come. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1QVYV5a544&t=128.16s)]
*  Officials are stressing the missing children are unaccounted for, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1QVYV5a544&t=135.07999999999998s)]
*  but that may be because they're out of communication rather than lost. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1QVYV5a544&t=138.6s)]
*  Boats, drones and helicopters are being used to try to find survivors. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1QVYV5a544&t=143.12s)]
*  Some people have been rescued from the air. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1QVYV5a544&t=147.68s)]
*  Helicopters have even been hovering over trees [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1QVYV5a544&t=150.6s)]
*  to see if people are clinging onto branches after being swept away. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1QVYV5a544&t=153.76s)]
*  This man said his mobile home had been destroyed. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1QVYV5a544&t=158.16s)]
*  Yeah, I'm homeless. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1QVYV5a544&t=161.28s)]
*  It floated down the river maybe 80 yards [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1QVYV5a544&t=163.2s)]
*  and these two trees, it just lodged in between two trees. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1QVYV5a544&t=168.12s)]
*  So it's not going anywhere anymore. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1QVYV5a544&t=172.32s)]
*  Rescue efforts are being hampered by difficult access to the area [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1QVYV5a544&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  after roads were washed away. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1QVYV5a544&t=177.88s)]
*  Texas officials have said the White House has been in contact to offer assistance [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1QVYV5a544&t=180.2s)]
*  and the US Coast Guard has been activated to help with the search. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1QVYV5a544&t=184.64s)]
