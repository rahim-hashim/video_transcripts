**BBC - The Latest:** [April 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-E0yetg0vM)
*  Italian police have confirmed that four people have died after a cable car crashed near Naples [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-E0yetg0vM&t=0.0s)]
*  yesterday. The British couple are among the dead. Five people were on the cable car at the time of [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-E0yetg0vM&t=5.28s)]
*  the accident. Operators say the carriage had been near the top of Mount Vito when one of the cables [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-E0yetg0vM&t=10.4s)]
*  snapped. Our correspondent Rupert Wingfield-Hayes has more from Rome. Well so in the last couple [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-E0yetg0vM&t=16.56s)]
*  of hours we have had confirmation to the BBC from police in Naples that there are two, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-E0yetg0vM&t=21.68s)]
*  what they describe as a British couple, are now confirmed to be among the dead. They have not been [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-E0yetg0vM&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  formally identified and they have not been officially named but they have now said to us [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-E0yetg0vM&t=35.84s)]
*  they are certain that there is a British couple and an Israeli citizen and an Italian citizen are [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-E0yetg0vM&t=40.8s)]
*  the four who have died and there is a fifth person who is in hospital, very seriously injured. They [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-E0yetg0vM&t=47.36s)]
*  have not confirmed the nationality or the identity of that person but we are now starting to get a [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-E0yetg0vM&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  clearer picture at least of the victims of this accident. What we have not got really any clear [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-E0yetg0vM&t=57.76s)]
*  picture of yet is why this accident happened. Very very serious incident with this cable car coming [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-E0yetg0vM&t=63.28s)]
*  down, cable snapping and then this car plunging a long way down. This is on the top of a mountain [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-E0yetg0vM&t=69.76s)]
*  with these very large tall steel pylons that they go over and this cable snapping and the car then [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-E0yetg0vM&t=77.04s)]
*  just plunging into the forest below shattering on impact and these people being killed. It is really [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-E0yetg0vM&t=82.56s)]
*  a worse nightmare scenario for this sort of incident but that investigation is just getting [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-E0yetg0vM&t=88.56s)]
*  underway. Absolutely horrific ordeal and terrible for the families of the victims. We do know that [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-E0yetg0vM&t=94.08s)]
*  the system of this cable car was very old wasn't it? That's right, built in 1952 so nearly 75 years [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-E0yetg0vM&t=101.2s)]
*  old. That is an old system by the standards of these things but they say the company that operates [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-E0yetg0vM&t=109.84s)]
*  it said that it had been down for maintenance over the winter and had had a full inspection before [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-E0yetg0vM&t=116.96s)]
*  reopening 10 days ago for the spring season. So they say this is an unthinkable thing to happen [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-E0yetg0vM&t=122.08s)]
*  but it has happened so clearly there are questions to be answered about the maintenance and the age [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-E0yetg0vM&t=127.44s)]
*  of some of these systems in Italy. Italy is a very mountainous country. There are cable car systems [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-E0yetg0vM&t=134.07999999999998s)]
*  all over Italy and they are regularly used by locals and by tourists going to scenic spots. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-E0yetg0vM&t=140.4s)]
*  It has to be said this is not a one-off. A very similar incident happened just four years ago [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-E0yetg0vM&t=147.76000000000002s)]
*  in the north of Italy which killed 14 people. So again I think a lot of questions to be answered [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-E0yetg0vM&t=154.72s)]
*  in this investigation as to the maintenance and the age of some of these systems. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-E0yetg0vM&t=160.24s)]
