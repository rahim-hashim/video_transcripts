# Is this the world’s first AI powered hotel? | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [February 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4)
*  Las Vegas welcomes over 40 million visitors every year. That's over 110,000 people every single day. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4&t=0.0s)]
*  And all of those travelers need somewhere to rest their weary heads after experiencing everything this city of excess has to offer. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4&t=11.0s)]
*  As well as the home of CES, Las Vegas is the city of hotels. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4&t=19.0s)]
*  There are more hotel rooms in this city than anywhere else on earth. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4&t=25.0s)]
*  So where better for a new property that's powered entirely by AI? And I'm here to check it out. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4&t=29.0s)]
*  Autonomous is a new hotel just a few minutes away from the Las Vegas strip. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4&t=36.0s)]
*  And its founders claim it's the first true AI-powered hotel in the world. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4&t=41.0s)]
*  In reality, many hotels are now integrating AI into their operations. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4&t=47.0s)]
*  But the team behind Autonomous say their hotel has it baked into every aspect of a guest's stay from the ground up. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4&t=53.0s)]
*  For us, AI is not for the sake of AI. It's really using technology to bring back something timeless, which is human connection. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4&t=60.0s)]
*  Ironically, using advanced systems to provide the simplest, most beautiful feeling, which is feeling that somebody truly understands you. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4&t=70.0s)]
*  And that's the power of AI for us. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4&t=83.0s)]
*  Once your reservation is made, the hotel will begin gathering as much information about you as it can. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4&t=86.0s)]
*  It will ask a series of questions about your preferences and will also scrape the internet and social media sites for information on you, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4&t=93.0s)]
*  using that data to personalise your stay and build a digital avatar. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4&t=101.0s)]
*  As with many modern hotels, guests will be able to check in and access their rooms without any human interaction. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4&t=106.0s)]
*  So this is the check-in process and it's all handled through the phone. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4&t=113.0s)]
*  So I just need to complete it on here and do a little bit of identification, verification first, which I'm just filling in now. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4&t=117.0s)]
*  And from there, I just need to scan my face to prove that it's me. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4&t=128.0s)]
*  There we go. And we're done. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4&t=133.0s)]
*  I'm in. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4&t=140.0s)]
*  The hotel also features what it calls an e-butler system, whereby everything from room service to fresh towels can be delivered to the guest via the room panel or a smartphone [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4&t=147.0s)]
*  without the need to speak to or even see a member of staff. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4&t=157.0s)]
*  Now the idea is that you can have as much or as little human interaction as you want. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4&t=163.0s)]
*  And all of the services and amenities with the room are controlled by a panel like this. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4&t=168.0s)]
*  To test it out, I requested some extra towels for the room. And all being well, we'll see if this works. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4&t=173.0s)]
*  Oh, I just heard that's unlocked. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4&t=193.0s)]
*  Here are my nice clean towels. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4&t=200.0s)]
*  Featuring one-bed rooms up to six-bedroom suites, the hotel has been designed so that it can dynamically adapt the layout, allocating a combination of rooms and suites together, depending on the customer's needs. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4&t=203.0s)]
*  So this is one single apartment, but for the purposes of this booking, we've also booked the apartment next door. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4&t=216.0s)]
*  And the system automatically knows that we've got both apartments and unlocks this interconnecting door so I can walk through to the next one. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4&t=222.0s)]
*  Of course, many of these features already exist in different hotels. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4&t=231.0s)]
*  But what the team behind Autonomous say they're trying to do is combine all of these services and more and bring all of the data together to build a complete digital profile. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4&t=235.0s)]
*  Autonomous say that this data collection will allow them to customize every aspect of a guest's day at a granular level. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4&t=245.0s)]
*  But will people really be that comfortable with allowing a hotel to know every aspect of their personality? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4&t=251.0s)]
*  The guest is in full control of all the data. So first they can opt out of the data from the first second, or they can opt out of the data at any time during the journey. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4&t=260.0s)]
*  But also you can go back and delete all the data that you want. So we're only a custodian of the data and the guest is in full control of all that data. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4&t=272.0s)]
*  The purpose for us is strictly and simply to offer a better stay. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4&t=281.0s)]
*  And with so many hotels concentrated in one place, why choose Las Vegas to launch such a concept? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4&t=286.0s)]
*  What's a better place to launch a hospitality concept from Las Vegas? The heart and the epicenter of hospitality globally. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4&t=293.0s)]
*  And especially when you have a layer of tech and you have the CEO, the biggest technology show in the world here in Vegas. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4&t=303.0s)]
*  So everything comes together. That's the right place for me to go head to head against 200,000 plus rooms with a unique product that we're offering that hotel basically cannot offer. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4&t=310.0s)]
*  So if we make it in Vegas, which we will, we're going to make it globally. And that's a proof, a very powerful proof of concept. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4&t=320.0s)]
*  And that's why Las Vegas for me is the right and special place to launch it. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4&t=328.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_ZMWBQ6a4&t=340.0s)]
