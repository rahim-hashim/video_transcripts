# Why filmmaker Ken Burns is revisiting the American Revolution, 250 years on | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [April 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI)
*  Okay, the documentarian, the filmmaker in me wants to make that the last question [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=0.0s)]
*  because it was such a perfect answer. However, I'm gonna botch it. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=3.88s)]
*  Well the editor, and our wonderful editor can fix that. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  And can cut it out entirely too. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=10.76s)]
*  Ken, your documentaries have won every award there is. I imagine Grammys, Peabodies, Emmys. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  You're working currently on this opus for the 250th anniversary of the American Revolution. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=23.88s)]
*  You had success very young. Is it what you expected? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=31.16s)]
*  No, not at all. In fact, I thought that becoming a documentary filmmaker, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=36.4s)]
*  I had grown up wanting to be a feature filmmaker, a Hollywood director, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=43.0s)]
*  John Ford or Alfred Hitchcock or Howard Hawks. Those were my heroes growing up. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=46.0s)]
*  And I think that I wanted to be Alfred Hitchcock. My mom was dying my entire life [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  until she died when I was just short of my 12th birthday. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=57.279999999999994s)]
*  And I remember a few months afterwards, my father was watching Sir Carol Reed's [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=60.559999999999995s)]
*  Odd Man Out about the Irish troubles in teens and twenties. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=65.39999999999999s)]
*  James Mason. And my dad started to cry. Never saw my dad cry. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=70.32s)]
*  And at that moment I said, I want to be a filmmaker. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=74.44s)]
*  And then going to college and sort of having my molecules rearranged at [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=77.48s)]
*  Hampshire College with teachers who were social documentary still photographers, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=81.24s)]
*  that I thought that becoming a documentary filmmaker in American history was like [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=86.28s)]
*  taking an immediate vow of anonymity and poverty. And part of that was reinforced [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=91.48s)]
*  by my desire to move out of New York City to come up here to be able to figure out [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=96.84s)]
*  how to edit my first film. And it got nominated for an Academy Award and people said, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=102.4s)]
*  oh, you're going to move back to New York. You're going to L.A. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=108.08s)]
*  And I said, I'm staying here. And so I used to think moving up here was the best decision. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=110.32s)]
*  It was actually staying here was the best decision because there's a humility that comes [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=114.68s)]
*  from a small town like this. You cannot. And the weather. You cannot be anything but [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=120.24s)]
*  sort of humble. So coming up here to New Hampshire gave you for economic reasons at the time. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=126.52s)]
*  You were young and poor and struggling. Exactly. Allowed you the freedom to do what you do. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=131.88s)]
*  But it gave you something else as well. Some kind of mental space to kind of splendid. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=136.6s)]
*  A kind of splendid isolation takes place. And in a way, you're telling stories of people. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=143.4s)]
*  And perhaps you could argue the counter, which would be wouldn't it wouldn't staying in [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=148.76s)]
*  Manhattan surrounded by people and stories have been also. Well, you could ask him if you were [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=153.0s)]
*  around Leo Tolstoy, who writes novels filled with hundreds and hundreds of characters, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=159.08s)]
*  that the requirement in order to summon them in fiction, this case, not fact, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=164.92000000000002s)]
*  requires a kind of removal to be able to do it. And so there's paradoxical. I'm close to New York [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=172.36s)]
*  City. I spend a lot of time there. I love the city. I was born in Brooklyn. I didn't grow up [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=179.64000000000001s)]
*  there, but it's it's part of my life. But all of my daughters live there. So it's it's it's not an [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=185.56s)]
*  either or. And I think that's the problem. We have become so attached to facile and really [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=192.52s)]
*  non-existent binaries that everything is always argument. And in fact, the essence of a good story [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=199.32s)]
*  is the disarming of argument in favor of accepting the possibility, as Wynton Marcella said in my [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=206.76s)]
*  jazz film, that sometimes a thing in the opposite of a thing could be true at the same time. Like [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=214.04s)]
*  we understand that in our personal lives, we understand that in our intimate lives, we [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=219.56s)]
*  understand that in great stories. We just can't drag it into a kind of public sphere these days. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=223.72s)]
*  It has to be an argument. It has to be either one or lost, up or down, good or bad, gay or straight, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=229.72s)]
*  young or male, male or all these things that we do, and they're non-existent. And what you forget [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=235.64s)]
*  is that the best stories are like a wheel in which you are aware of all the spokes and that [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=241.32s)]
*  you can have and things can coexist that are contradictory. And that's the essence, that it [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=248.44s)]
*  isn't agenda based narrative. It's just the whole wild, unformed thing, which you have to figure out [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=255.32s)]
*  how to honor because nature has never listened to Aristotle, has not read poetics. And it and so you [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=263.56s)]
*  have to find a way that both respects the perfection of what takes place in all of human [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=270.04s)]
*  events and what goes on in the universe, and then how we humans tell the story. Honey, how was your [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=278.12s)]
*  day? Does not begin. I back slowly down the driveway, avoiding the garbage can at the curb. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=283.72s)]
*  We edit human experience, and when it's big stuff of the kinds of themes that we try to tackle, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=290.20000000000005s)]
*  you've got an obligation that you can't do it. Like I can be anywhere else but PBS instantly. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=297.24s)]
*  The Vietnam series, 10 episodes, 18 hours, cost $30 million. I could have walked in as I began that [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=302.52s)]
*  project to any premium cable station or any streaming service and said, I need $30 million, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=308.92s)]
*  and they would have given it. What they wouldn't have given me are the 10 and a half years that I [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=316.59999999999997s)]
*  needed and knew I needed to do it. They'd want it in two, two and a half years. And so what [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=321.56s)]
*  public broadcasting has done, what the splendid isolation of Walpole, New Hampshire has done, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=326.76s)]
*  what the sort of band of brothers and sisters that have worked, some people have worked with me for [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=331.4s)]
*  50 years or 40 years or 35 years or 25 years, is that we've been able to craft these things without [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=336.2s)]
*  the this sort of buffeting that the industry always does, the compromises that always are [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=343.08000000000004s)]
*  forced on you. And so I have the great privilege of telling you that every one of the whatever it [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=351.48s)]
*  is, 39 or 40 films, are director's cuts. It's been documentaries, and I was wondering how you choose [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=356.6s)]
*  your subjects. I know you have projects planned out many years in advance, but why, for example, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=363.0s)]
*  jazz and baseball and not rock and roll and football? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=368.44s)]
*  You know, the glib response Katty is to say they choose me. And there's a degree of truth to that. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=373.16s)]
*  A good story is a good story is a good story, and it will insinuate and insist. So your head might [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=378.76s)]
*  be filled with 40 or 50 topics, as my head is always filled up. But when one drops down to your [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=384.04s)]
*  heart and you realize that it's firing on all cylinders for lots of ways. So I'm in the middle [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=390.36s)]
*  of working on this Civil War series that came out in 1990. And I am realizing that this is the most [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=397.0s)]
*  important event in American history. Everything before it led up to it. Everything since has been [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=406.6s)]
*  in many ways a consequence of it. And when that was over, it was surprisingly huge, big thing [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=410.44s)]
*  all around the world. We're working on things. And I decided I wanted to do something on baseball. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=416.44s)]
*  And all of a sudden, I realized that I was working on the sequel to the Civil War, and people thought [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=422.2s)]
*  I was nuts. And I said, well, the first real progress in civil rights in a major, not just [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=426.52s)]
*  symbolic, but major social way was when Jackie Robinson, the grandson of a slave, made his way [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=432.6s)]
*  to first base on April 15 1947, way after the end of the of the Civil War. But it was the first real [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=438.68s)]
*  progress, the beginning of what we would call the Civil Rights era, though it had been going on [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=445.88s)]
*  before. And there were other people who had worked hard in all the intervening decades and even been [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=450.2s)]
*  baseball players at the equivalent of the major league level in the 1880s and 90s until they were [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=455.47999999999996s)]
*  banned because of the color of their skin. And then you have jazz, which is created by a people [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=460.92s)]
*  who have the peculiar experience of being unfree in a supposedly free land. And they create this [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=466.91999999999996s)]
*  music that is recognized around the world as our art form. And then I realized I was working on a [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=473.4s)]
*  trilogy. I had to get baseball done in order to to start jazz. So a lot of the times the thinking [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=478.04s)]
*  is different. Another point is just seeing a bit of footage or somebody says, a friend of mine said, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=483.40000000000003s)]
*  what about country music? And I went, oh, perfect. And I'm a child of rock and roll. But I knew that [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=489.56s)]
*  that was going to be a much better subject than rock and roll or whatever. That's because that's [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=495.72s)]
*  why I was wondering what when you're a child of rock and roll, I'm a child of rock and roll. What [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=501.24s)]
*  is it about rock and roll that isn't enough? It's not that it's not. It's that I don't want to tell [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=505.72s)]
*  you stories about what I know. I want to show that's homework, right? Like what you should know. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=511.32000000000005s)]
*  I'd rather share with you a process of discovery. And so I dive into things that I don't know enough [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=517.5600000000001s)]
*  about. I mean, I did do baseball, which I thought I knew something. And every day was a daily [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=523.5600000000001s)]
*  humiliation. And I did do Vietnam, which I lived on a college campus, Ann Arbor, Michigan, you know, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=528.44s)]
*  growing up through grade school and high school. And so I thought I knew it. I had a high draft [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=534.4399999999999s)]
*  number. So I was trying to conscience those objectors. So I got out of that, but I knew nothing. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=539.88s)]
*  And so the idea- Because you hadn't been there. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=545.08s)]
*  Because I hadn't been there because I also hadn't understood the full context of all of those [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=548.6s)]
*  different spokes. I saw it from the- You saw your spoke. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=553.64s)]
*  I saw my spoke. And so what we like to do, I mean, it's the same with the revolution now, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=556.4399999999999s)]
*  the American Revolution, is that it has become so protected and encased in sort of amber because [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=561.56s)]
*  we accept the violence of the Civil War. We accept the violence of all the 20th century wars that [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=569.4s)]
*  we've been in. But the revolution is these are great ideas and they are. And great men are thinking [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=574.28s)]
*  great ideas, but you forget it's our Civil War. Our Civil War is a sectional war. The revolution [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=580.4399999999999s)]
*  is a civil war. There's like at least 20%, maybe 25% in some areas much more are loyalists, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=586.12s)]
*  remaining faithful to the king. There's nothing wrong with the status quo. That's called a [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=592.2s)]
*  conservative. That's what you do. And the patriots were risking everything and lots of people who [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=596.2s)]
*  were disaffected just sort of paying attention to who's going to win and just wanting to stay out [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=601.1600000000001s)]
*  of harm's way. So it makes places like New Jersey and South Carolina about as bad as South Vietnam [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=605.08s)]
*  during the Tet Offensive. It's interesting what you say there about the Revolutionary War. And [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=613.88s)]
*  it makes me think of the Holocaust and America's and you approached it from this unusual angle of [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=618.28s)]
*  America's relationship with the Holocaust. Are you trying consciously to expose questions rather than, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=624.92s)]
*  I suppose, provide answers that haven't been, that people don't want to broach necessarily or [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=632.68s)]
*  haven't thought of broaching? I think so. Am I being too grandiose? Because it implies [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=637.56s)]
*  a sort of intentionality to it. When you see that something's a good story, you want to do it. And [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=644.2s)]
*  that means if you're going to dive deep, you're inevitably going to bring up contradictory and [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=649.56s)]
*  complex stories that go fundamentally to who we are, who we like to think we are, who we're not, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=655.72s)]
*  even though we think we are, and all of the possible combinations in between. And that's a [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=662.4399999999999s)]
*  complicated thing to do. And you want to make sure that in the course of that, there's no scold, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=667.96s)]
*  there's no particular political thumb that you're placing on the scale that anybody, any American, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=673.96s)]
*  any human being who has got maybe an eighth grade education, although some of our films play even [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=681.72s)]
*  well in lower grade schools, will be drawn to. Because ignorance is not a crime. Willful [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=688.76s)]
*  ignorance is. Stupidity is. We want to just say, we didn't know. This is what we've learned. Can [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=698.2s)]
*  we share with you what we've just discovered? And that, hey, let me tell you what I just learned is [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=704.2s)]
*  so much better way to at least even begin the process. But we don't go saying, and therefore [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=710.12s)]
*  we'll be able to throw this zinger at Americans and really make them wake up and... No. So stories [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=715.72s)]
*  are one way of keeping things a little bit alive, but also the best stories also wake us up to the [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=723.4s)]
*  realities of what our future will be. And in my case, I take the past to tell us something about [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=732.52s)]
*  not where we are and where we're going to be. Those are byproducts of the films, but where we've [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=740.36s)]
*  been and how very, very much they were exactly like us. People say history repeats itself. It [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=746.44s)]
*  never has. You're condemned to repeat what you don't remember. Lovely phrase, often attributed [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=754.84s)]
*  to George Santayana and the Holocaust. It's just not true. It's a lovely phrase. You'd wish that [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=759.5600000000001s)]
*  would be true. Mark Twain is supposed to have said, we can't prove it precisely, so supposed to is the [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=764.36s)]
*  good cheat word that history doesn't repeat itself, but it rhymes. And that's a wonderful [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=770.84s)]
*  phrase because that's exactly it. Ecclesiastes, which may be a better authority, the Old Testament [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=776.52s)]
*  said, what has been will be again. What has been done will be done again. There's nothing new under [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=781.88s)]
*  the sun, which means human nature doesn't change. So every time we work for 10 years on a project [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=786.6800000000001s)]
*  of the national parks or Vietnam or the American Revolution, you lift up at the end. At no point [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=792.6800000000001s)]
*  during it you're going, aha, isn't that so much like today? You look up and you go, oh my God, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=797.48s)]
*  it's so much like today. This venality, this virtue, this greed, this generosity, it's repeating [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=803.5600000000001s)]
*  itself. We know these people and we understand the people who are both. Sometimes we sort of say, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=811.16s)]
*  oh, you're bad and you're good. And what we understand from honesty about ourselves, we've [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=816.28s)]
*  got both of those things in us and we've done some bad things and we've done some good things. And [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=821.48s)]
*  how do we reconcile all of that? So we don't have to throw anybody out. We don't have to cancel [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=826.68s)]
*  anybody out, nor do we have to present some trickily superficial version of American history. We can [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=832.4399999999999s)]
*  just say this is called balls and strikes. And you know what? The perspective of the shortstop [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=838.28s)]
*  is really different than the perspective of the right fielder or the catcher. And we want to have [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=845.7199999999999s)]
*  all those perspectives as well as the people sitting on the bench and the manager and the [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=851.8s)]
*  people in the stands. Whatever we do, it's going to be like today because human beings don't change. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=856.76s)]
*  It's all of the spokes. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=862.3599999999999s)]
*  It's all of the spokes. And that human beings don't change can be [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=864.12s)]
*  criminally sad and it can also be something to rejoice about. And within those parameters is where [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=870.76s)]
*  human experience lies. The fact that we don't learn and the fact that we do learn. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=880.76s)]
*  When you think about America, it seems that there's almost a sort of an America you're [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=884.8399999999999s)]
*  longing to describe or searching for or portraying a kind of de-toc-villian America of shared [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=891.4s)]
*  experience and community. And I was wondering if that's why you go to history so often, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=897.88s)]
*  that you find it more in history than you might find it today. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=902.68s)]
*  I live in a small town. You see it every single day, the kind of willingness to help another to [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=908.12s)]
*  wave at a…I walk three miles every morning with my dog and I wave at every car whether they wave [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=912.84s)]
*  back or not. Most people wave back. I think maybe at the beginning, growing up, I had a kind of [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=918.12s)]
*  idealized version of my country. I love my country. I don't know anyone who loves their country more [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=928.4399999999999s)]
*  than me. As I learned to tell the stories, I learned how complicated it was from the very, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=934.28s)]
*  very beginning, from the first stories that we're telling that for everything and the opposite [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=942.76s)]
*  thing might also be true. And so it became incumbent to try to figure out how. And I've worked with [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=948.4399999999999s)]
*  principally Jeffrey Ward, who has been a master as a writer in tolerating the contradictions [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=955.4s)]
*  between Americans and within Americans. Somebody like Thomas Jefferson, who is able to distill [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=962.68s)]
*  a century of enlightenment thinking into one remarkable sentence that I think the most [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=970.1999999999999s)]
*  important sentence in the English language after I love you, that begins, we hold these truths to be [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=975.9599999999999s)]
*  self-evident. He said, sacred and undeniable. And Franklin said, no, self-evident. And the last thing [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=982.1999999999999s)]
*  in the world that was self-evident were the truths that he was about to articulate. They were not. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=987.48s)]
*  Everybody was a subject up to that point, and he was suggesting something else. But he said that all [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=992.84s)]
*  men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator, meaning this is not bestowed by any [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=997.72s)]
*  monarch with certain unalienable rights that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1002.6800000000001s)]
*  happiness. He owned hundreds of human beings in his lifetime. He knew it was wrong, and he kept [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1008.44s)]
*  doing it. And the historian Annette Gordon-Reed in the film said, well, why if you knew it was wrong [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1013.4s)]
*  and you could do it? Because she goes, that's the question for all of us, which was exactly the right [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1017.64s)]
*  answer. The impulse is to go either to shame Jefferson or be upset with anybody who even [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1022.76s)]
*  brought up the fact that Jefferson did that. Why are you muddying the waters? And so what we're [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1027.8s)]
*  saying is that American history is a mirror that holds up to us an incredibly complicated story of [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1032.84s)]
*  us. I've said this. I make films about the U.S., but I make films about us and all the intimacy of [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1039.88s)]
*  that lowercase two-letter plural pronoun, all the intimacy of us and we and our and all of the [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1046.44s)]
*  majesty, the complexity, the contradiction, and even the controversy of the United States. And it's, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1053.8000000000002s)]
*  you know, if I were given 3,000 years to live, and I will not, I will not run out of topics in [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1059.0s)]
*  American history. If you had to choose a modern subject to find that essence of America, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1064.36s)]
*  would you be interested in doing so and where would you look? Oh yeah, well, it's less modern. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1077.32s)]
*  History provides a kind of triangulation. Philip Graham, who owned the Washington Post, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1083.08s)]
*  wrote that journalism is the first rough draft of history. It's a wonderful phrase until you [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1089.4s)]
*  stop and think, have you ever turned in a rough draft? No, it requires what? A little time, a [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1094.68s)]
*  little work and stuff like that. So what history is, is allowing some passage of time to provide [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1100.44s)]
*  perspective and to get even more sources, right? So we have great journalists in our country and [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1106.04s)]
*  that is a wonderful tradition that we have and the best in the world, I believe. And yet, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1112.92s)]
*  you need some distance. We're working, I've been interviewing Obama about his administration and I, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1119.48s)]
*  the longer I wait to do that film, the better it will be because of the passage of, the perspective [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1126.3600000000001s)]
*  that the passage of time will give. And the other day, even though all these projects and more, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1132.04s)]
*  Martin Luther King, things like that, Crime and Punishment, will go to the 2030s, I just the other [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1136.52s)]
*  day said, boy, I'd like to do a history of the CIA. But somebody asked of Duke Ellington, who is [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1141.64s)]
*  certainly our most prolific, maybe 22, 2300, 2400 compositions and I think our greatest composer, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1149.96s)]
*  what the most important one is. He said the one I'm working on now. And to me, that's how we feel. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1159.0s)]
*  It's like the process when I put my head on a pillow, I just want to know that I made [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1164.1200000000001s)]
*  a film better that day. Is there any downside to the success you've had and the fame that's come [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1169.88s)]
*  with it? Not for you personally? Not really. I think first that the isolation here, there's a [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1175.24s)]
*  wonderful nutritional celebrity. Like if somebody stops me on the street in New York, it's because [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1184.04s)]
*  they've spent 15 hours watching, you know, the Roosevelts. So can I give them 15 seconds or [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1189.4s)]
*  50 seconds? Of course. And I have unbelievable encounters with people. I was taking my oldest [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1196.04s)]
*  daughter to a college interview at NYU before she went to Yale. And we were walking across [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1203.56s)]
*  Washington Square Park and this man came up to me and he moved towards me so much so that I [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1211.32s)]
*  started to step in front of Sarah. And he goes, my brother's daughter died, my brother's daughter [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1215.96s)]
*  died. And I went, oh my God. And I put, you know, I put her behind me. And he then said, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1220.92s)]
*  he saw and he went, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, crib death. And I said, oh, I'm sorry, I have daughters [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1227.72s)]
*  too. And then he said, I didn't know what to do. My brother and I were so close. And then I [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1233.4s)]
*  remembered your baseball film, which we'd watched together. So I went back to my parents' house and [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1239.0s)]
*  we got the gloves that we had as kids. And I went to the back door, not the front door. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1244.2s)]
*  And I walked in and I just handed him the mitt and we went out and we played catch. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1250.44s)]
*  You know, Katie, that's the only reason why you want to make a film, right? Is that somewhere, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1256.28s)]
*  somebody has some moment in which the emotional archaeology that I've described it had an effect, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1261.56s)]
*  had a power. So there's not a downside to it. Sometimes I can go for weeks in New York, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1269.24s)]
*  completely anonymous and I walk everywhere. I take the subway. I am not, you know, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1277.64s)]
*  chauffeur or Uber or whatever. And then, and then some week for some reason, all of a sudden, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1282.68s)]
*  the fire guy will go, Hey, that's the guy who made the civil war or baseball. He goes, what? [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1290.2s)]
*  He goes, what? You don't know the PBS guy, you know, and you go, okay, this is good. Or [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1295.8000000000002s)]
*  you're in a cab. And the Haitian driver said that I couldn't get my citizenship until I [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1301.08s)]
*  passed the test. And what they recommend is that I watch your films. And so I have, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1309.32s)]
*  you know, and he wants to discuss some intricacy of the civil war or of the Roosevelt's. And you [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1315.32s)]
*  just kind of go, I mean, there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. My daughters, when they see that, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1321.8s)]
*  they understand that, you know, they can see the awards and they can see this. But when there's [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1329.8s)]
*  those individual kind of moments of people telling you, and I've got 150 of those stories, the mail [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1337.88s)]
*  that I got after the civil war and the little gifts that were given to me, it's just so amazing. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1346.12s)]
*  Ken, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Now you made me cry. I made myself cry. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1353.4s)]
*  You don't have mascara on. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MQv1mmvnfI&t=1359.0s)]
