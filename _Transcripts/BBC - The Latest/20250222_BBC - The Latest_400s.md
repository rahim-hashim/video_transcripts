Video Description: Australia’s busiest waterway, Sydney Harbour hosts thousands of commuter ferries, recreational yachts and around 1200 commercial vessels each year. But boats burn fuel - and globally, shipping accounts for 3% of carbon emissions. 

And whilst the commuter ferries here are to be replaced with electric ones in the next decade, BBC Click’s Nick Kwek has been to meet a local startup that’s already using robotics to clean up our waters.

**BBC - The Latest:** [February 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0)
*  It's Australia's busiest waterway. Sydney Harbour hosts thousands of commuter ferries, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=0.0s)]
*  recreational yachts and around 1200 commercial vessels each year. But boats burn fuel. And [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=10.0s)]
*  globally shipping accounts for 3% of carbon emissions. And whilst the commuter ferries [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=18.32s)]
*  here are to be replaced with electric ones in the next decade, one local startup is already [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=24.68s)]
*  working to clean up our waters. Hullbot cleans away sludge that slows boats down. The slime [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=30.92s)]
*  which can develop can increase the drag of the ship such that you have a 25% or higher increase [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=42.56s)]
*  in fuel consumption. And it also leads to a massive increase in emissions. Biofouling on [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=50.44s)]
*  hulls causes at least 1% of total global greenhouse gas emissions. You can see the water rippling. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=57.0s)]
*  Can we see some brushing? Yeah, you can see some brushing. If you're brave enough, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=64.4s)]
*  you can put your hand on there and feel how powerful it is. Go on then. Get in there. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=68.72s)]
*  The company hopes to reduce the need for conventional protective anti-fouling paint, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=75.56s)]
*  which is toxic for marine life. It's actually one of the largest direct sources of ocean [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=80.32000000000001s)]
*  microplastics is this paint. It's not a byproduct of something else like, you know, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=87.08000000000001s)]
*  dust from car tyres or microfibres from textiles. We're deliberately pouring plastic and poison [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=92.28s)]
*  Underwater, things that usually help autonomous vehicles move around like GPS and LIDAR scanners [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=101.08s)]
*  just don't work. So they've designed their own complex navigation and perception system. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=108.08s)]
*  Look at it go. Once you're actually in contact with a boat and the robot is in this highly [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=113.92s)]
*  disturbed environment and it's pushing against the boat and the boat's pushing back and it's [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=122.92s)]
*  being pushed in waves and so on, then you need a very sophisticated way to see through this kind [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=127.6s)]
*  of cloud of bubbles and particles and so on. And that's what we've developed. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=135.64s)]
*  We have lots of boats that have 20, 30, 40 years worth of lifespan left. Lots of those boats are [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=141.32s)]
*  not going to be able to be retrofitted to become electric or something else. The best way of saving [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  emissions from those boats, of saving the waterways that they're in, is to make them more efficient, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=156.0s)]
*  to keep them clean, to make sure that we have slippery hulls going through the water as easily [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=160.64s)]
*  as possible. That exists as a problem across the world. As well as scrubbing, the bot is being [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=166.08s)]
*  modified to tackle another threat to underwater wildlife. We've adapted hullbot into a tool for [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=171.52s)]
*  managing sea urchins which are in overabundance and threatening kelp on lots of coastlines around [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=178.8s)]
*  the world. They've called it cullbot and it can detect and control the pests with a drill attachment. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=185.2s)]
*  In a special mode we call urchin destroy mode. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=192.32s)]
*  It's been trialled by researchers from the University of New South Wales and the Sydney [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=198.72s)]
*  Institute of Marine Science as part of their restoration efforts. So seagrass meadows and kelp [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=203.44s)]
*  forests are super important habitats that they provide food and home and shelter for hundreds of [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=209.28s)]
*  other species. It's what we call foundation species. Globally we've lost about a third of the world's [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=216.32s)]
*  seagrasses and about 50 percent of the world's kelp forests are degraded or declining. Up until now [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=222.32s)]
*  they've used some very manual tools. We're about to count the urchins that we see in 10 meter bands [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=229.28s)]
*  and then we go back along the line again and we use this quadrat. We place it down and we take photos [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=237.51999999999998s)]
*  along the transit line as well and then we can take that data and go back and now review it all back [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=244.4s)]
*  in the office. When we go with divers we're only able to sample a small section of our study habitat. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=249.2s)]
*  The beauty about a robot is that it can go very deep it can stay down for as long as we want it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=256.56s)]
*  It scans the ocean floor taking photos of the habitat as it goes automatically piecing them [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=262.8s)]
*  together to build a precise digital record in the form of 3D models. It's a great science [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=268.16s)]
*  communication tool because we can show the funding bodies for example or just the general public [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=275.84s)]
*  what things look like look like before and after we intervene. Yeah if we came back at night they [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=282.08s)]
*  would be all out. So what do you think Adriana? This is excellent you can see the barren area [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=287.2s)]
*  really well you can see the sea urchins and you can see how with the robot you can just capture [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=293.52s)]
*  a much much larger area of the seafloor than we can with others. Surprisingly clear an image isn't [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=298.71999999999997s)]
*  it? It is actually and it's not a particularly good day either so. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=305.84s)]
*  Instead of sending divers down for days at a time in shark-infested waters Adriana thinks the same job [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=309.44s)]
*  could be done with the bot in only a couple of hours. It's not only about not damaging marine [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=319.04s)]
*  habitats anymore it's about recovering what we have lost because there have been you know hundreds [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=324.32s)]
*  of years of destruction of taking nature for granted so it is an exciting time because we're [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=329.36s)]
*  trying to turn from a decline to a recovery and it is happening. You know we'd love to solve climate [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=334.72s)]
*  change we'd love to clean up the ocean but it's a time consuming activity to get in there and pick [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=340.8s)]
*  up plastic or get rid of pest species or clean holes by hand. Robots let us automate that but [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=346.48s)]
*  they also let us do it much more frequently and on a much bigger scale the kind of scale we need [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=353.04s)]
*  to solve the immensity of these challenges. Of course this is just one tool in the giant [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=359.28s)]
*  jigsaw of cleaning up our mess. Like many others it's for us industry and governments to determine [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=365.35999999999996s)]
*  whether or not to do something with them. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=372.4s)]
*  you [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRbFarKQUP0&t=389.28s)]
