*  Now let's turn to South Korea. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XWfbqpEpE&t=0.0s)]
*  Judges at the impeachment trial of the suspended president, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XWfbqpEpE&t=2.0s)]
*  Yoon Suk-yul, are set to hand down a verdict in the next few days. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XWfbqpEpE&t=5.1000000000000005s)]
*  He faces allegations of attempting to orchestrate a rebellion [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XWfbqpEpE&t=9.0s)]
*  when he briefly imposed martial law in December. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XWfbqpEpE&t=12.700000000000001s)]
*  Police arrested Yoon in January. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XWfbqpEpE&t=15.5s)]
*  After a week-long standoff, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XWfbqpEpE&t=17.5s)]
*  the president's lawyers have called for the charges to be dropped. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XWfbqpEpE&t=19.5s)]
*  Let's speak to Nemo Kim, a journalist based in Seoul. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XWfbqpEpE&t=23.0s)]
*  Nemo, you've been following this story very closely. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XWfbqpEpE&t=26.0s)]
*  Just bring us up to date, bring us your expectations of what we can expect, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XWfbqpEpE&t=29.0s)]
*  given the drama that we saw earlier on when all of this was unraveling in South Korea. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XWfbqpEpE&t=34.0s)]
*  The South Korean Constitutional Court, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XWfbqpEpE&t=40.0s)]
*  they concluded hearings in his impeachment trial last week, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XWfbqpEpE&t=43.0s)]
*  and they expected to deliver the verdict sometime in the next few days. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XWfbqpEpE&t=47.0s)]
*  And during the final hearing last week, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XWfbqpEpE&t=53.0s)]
*  parliamentary lawyers, as you said, accused him of attempting to establish a dictatorship, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XWfbqpEpE&t=56.0s)]
*  whereas on his side, President Yoon, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XWfbqpEpE&t=62.0s)]
*  he defended his actions as being necessary to protect the country [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XWfbqpEpE&t=65.0s)]
*  from what he called pro-Chinese and pro-North Korean forces. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XWfbqpEpE&t=70.0s)]
*  And President Yoon is a former prosecutor general himself. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XWfbqpEpE&t=75.0s)]
*  He himself and his legal team, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XWfbqpEpE&t=80.0s)]
*  they revealed pretty shocking details from cases, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XWfbqpEpE&t=83.0s)]
*  legal cases of Chinese and pro-North Korean spies being caught, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XWfbqpEpE&t=87.0s)]
*  incidents that were at the time largely ignored by South Korean media. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XWfbqpEpE&t=93.0s)]
*  And he specifically criticized the Liberal Opposition Party [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XWfbqpEpE&t=98.0s)]
*  for blocking amendments to this country's spy law, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XWfbqpEpE&t=103.0s)]
*  which currently excludes non-North Koreans. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XWfbqpEpE&t=108.0s)]
*  And that makes it challenging to prosecute Chinese spies or spies of other nationalities. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XWfbqpEpE&t=112.0s)]
*  And President Yoon's team also raised concerns about alleged election fraud [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XWfbqpEpE&t=118.0s)]
*  and accused the Liberal Opposition of obstructing a thorough probe into the National Election Commission. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XWfbqpEpE&t=125.0s)]
*  Recently, that commission was found to have engaged in over 800 cases of illegal hiring, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XWfbqpEpE&t=131.0s)]
*  basically hiring members of employees, families, and so on. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XWfbqpEpE&t=137.0s)]
*  And that's further fueling suspicions of misconduct in the country's election system. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XWfbqpEpE&t=143.0s)]
*  And many South Koreans who were unaware of these situations due to relative lack of reporting [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XWfbqpEpE&t=148.0s)]
*  were stunned by these revelations on the last day. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XWfbqpEpE&t=155.0s)]
*  Geopolitically, South Korea not only has North Korea to deal with, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XWfbqpEpE&t=158.0s)]
*  but we are in very close proximity to China and Russia. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XWfbqpEpE&t=162.0s)]
*  And one thing to note here is that fundamentally, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XWfbqpEpE&t=166.0s)]
*  the South Korean law allows its president to declare martial law in the case of an acute national emergency. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XWfbqpEpE&t=170.0s)]
*  And if the Constitutional Court appals, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XWfbqpEpE&t=177.0s)]
*  the court basically has to determine whether Mr. Yoon's actions constitute a legitimate response. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XWfbqpEpE&t=181.0s)]
*  If the court appals the impeachment, he will be permanently removed from office, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XWfbqpEpE&t=188.0s)]
*  and that would trigger a presidential election within 60 days. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6XWfbqpEpE&t=193.0s)]
