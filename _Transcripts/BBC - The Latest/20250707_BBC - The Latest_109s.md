# Netanyahu visits US as Trump puts pressure to agree Gaza ceasefire deal | BBCNews
**BBC - The Latest:** [July 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zZOyJvMC_g)
*  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in the United States for talks with President Trump [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zZOyJvMC_g&t=0.0s)]
*  as attempts continue to reach a deal for a Gaza ceasefire. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zZOyJvMC_g&t=5.0s)]
*  Mr Netanyahu's arrival comes after the latest round of indirect talks between Hamas and Israel in Qatar ended without any breakthrough. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zZOyJvMC_g&t=9.0s)]
*  But speaking ahead of Mr Netanyahu's visit to Washington, Donald Trump expressed optimism [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zZOyJvMC_g&t=18.0s)]
*  that progress could be achieved on the issue of the remaining Israeli hostages. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zZOyJvMC_g&t=23.0s)]
*  I think there's a good chance we have a deal with Hamas during the week, during the coming week, pertaining to quite a few of the hostages. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zZOyJvMC_g&t=28.0s)]
*  You know, we've gotten a lot of the hostages out, but pertaining to the remaining hostages, quite a few of them will be coming out. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zZOyJvMC_g&t=36.0s)]
*  We think we'll have that done this week. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zZOyJvMC_g&t=43.0s)]
*  Our correspondent in Jerusalem, Ioni Wells, explained what the ceasefire negotiations are currently focused on. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zZOyJvMC_g&t=46.0s)]
*  Well, both Donald Trump and Netanyahu will want something to show from this meeting later today. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zZOyJvMC_g&t=53.0s)]
*  But the question really is how much of a breakthrough or not will happen in these official talks as well. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zZOyJvMC_g&t=59.0s)]
*  At the moment, Israel has said that it is willing to agree to a ceasefire on the proposal it has agreed to, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zZOyJvMC_g&t=65.0s)]
*  so potentially suggesting they're not that happy to budge that much at the moment. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zZOyJvMC_g&t=72.0s)]
*  Hamas, though, has requested a couple of key changes. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zZOyJvMC_g&t=76.0s)]
*  They want a ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zZOyJvMC_g&t=79.0s)]
*  They want a ceasefire in Syria. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zZOyJvMC_g&t=80.0s)]
*  Hamas want the resumption of aid from the UN to be allowed into Gaza. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zZOyJvMC_g&t=81.0s)]
*  They want a withdrawal of Israeli troops. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zZOyJvMC_g&t=84.0s)]
*  And crucially, they want a commitment from the US that this war will end, that hostilities will end after any ceasefire period. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zZOyJvMC_g&t=86.0s)]
*  Now, that is something which Israel has previously rejected. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zZOyJvMC_g&t=94.0s)]
*  The question really ahead of this meeting between Donald Trump and Netanyahu is whether or not Donald Trump will put pressure on Netanyahu [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zZOyJvMC_g&t=97.0s)]
*  to offer some kind of concession on that particular sticking point. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zZOyJvMC_g&t=105.0s)]
