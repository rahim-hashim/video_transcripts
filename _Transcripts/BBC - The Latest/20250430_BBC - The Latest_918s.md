Video Description: The BBC has gained exclusive access to what locals call ‘The Forbidden Zone’ and can reveal the full extent of Turkey’s military expansion in Northern Iraq. 

Turkey maintains that its military operation in Northern Iraq is targeted to Kurdish militant group the PKK, a militant Kurdish nationalist group proscribed by the UK and other governments. 

Since 1984 the conflict has claimed more than 40,000 lives, many of them civilians.

*  Turkey. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=94.56s)]
*  This is what's known as the Forbidden Zone. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=97.12s)]
*  It's the area affected by the conflict between Turkey and the PKK, a militant Kurdish nationalist [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=101.0s)]
*  group. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=107.28s)]
*  PKK fighters have long used these mountains as a base for their operations across the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=110.0s)]
*  border in Turkey. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=116.08s)]
*  Since 1984, the conflict has claimed more than 40,000 lives, many of them civilians. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=120.4s)]
*  The PKK or Kurdistan Workers' Party is an armed guerrilla movement founded in Turkey [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=132.88s)]
*  in 1978. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=138.44s)]
*  At first, its goal was the creation of a state for the 30 million Kurds spread across Turkey, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=141.0s)]
*  Iraq, Syria and Iran. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=147.79999999999998s)]
*  It's long been designated a terrorist organization by Turkey and many Western nations. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=151.6s)]
*  Driven underground by Turkish military action, the PKK fighters operate from caves and tunnels [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=161.44s)]
*  in the mountains of Iraq. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=167.64s)]
*  After decades of fighting, hundreds of villages in northern Iraq have been abandoned. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=173.72s)]
*  People are advised not to come here because they risk being hit by Turkish air or drone [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=180.56s)]
*  strikes. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=185.92s)]
*  In August 2023, Hashem Shakir and his cousin, Alain, were driving near his village in the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=191.76s)]
*  evening. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=197.76s)]
*  They were targeted twice by a Turkish strike. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=199.04s)]
*  A year later, we returned to the strike location with Hashem and his wife. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=202.68s)]
*  Hashem was injured but he survived. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=221.44s)]
*  Alain was not so lucky. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=248.4s)]
*  He was 24 years old and a stage 4 cancer patient. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=250.84s)]
*  This is Hashem filmed soon after the strike when he was recovering. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=264.48s)]
*  He describes what happened. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=269.2s)]
*  The PKK is known to enlist the help of local people, but Hashem says he's had no connection [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=280.84s)]
*  with the group. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=300.23999999999995s)]
*  The conflict in northern Iraq has gone largely unreported. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=310.84s)]
*  One organization that records the casualties of Turkey's military action is human rights [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=330.76s)]
*  group Community Peacemaker Teams. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=336.0s)]
*  The group gathers evidence in the form of the victim's personal details. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=339.48s)]
*  As we look more closely at Hashem's and Alain's case, we'll find that it reveals some disturbing [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=360.64000000000004s)]
*  aspects of the Kurdish government's relations with Turkey. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=366.28s)]
*  Turkish troops have a long history of pursuing PKK militants across the border. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=371.88s)]
*  Today, the fight against the PKK is led by the President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=376.64s)]
*  The BBC repeatedly asked the Turkish authorities for an interview to discuss the matters raised [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=390.64s)]
*  in this film. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=396.16s)]
*  They declined our requests. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=397.16s)]
*  Dr. Zeynep Kaya is a Turkish academic who specializes in this conflict. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=399.56s)]
*  She explains why the Turkish government is so hostile to the PKK. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=405.08000000000004s)]
*  This increased autonomy, decentralization and potentially in the long term an independent [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=412.52000000000004s)]
*  Kurdistan is seen as a significant threat, an existential threat for the Turkish state. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=418.08000000000004s)]
*  The military operations and their nature and their scale gradually increased over time. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=424.56s)]
*  So the more the PKK military activity expanded, the more the Turkish military operations also [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=430.88s)]
*  expanded in northern Iraq. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=437.08s)]
*  Bombardment from the air and occasional incursions on the ground brought only limited success. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=442.28s)]
*  2018 was a crucial year. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=448.56s)]
*  Turkey started building many more military bases inside the forbidden zone. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=452.48s)]
*  They felt the need to deepen their operations. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=459.36s)]
*  They felt the need to establish bases to be able to control the developments on the ground [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=461.84000000000003s)]
*  much more effectively. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=466.76s)]
*  And this obviously has long term aims as well. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=468.88s)]
*  At the same time, Turkey's policy in the Middle East was undergoing a major shift, especially [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=473.40000000000003s)]
*  with regard to Syria and Iraq. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=479.8s)]
*  It was much more involved, it was much more interventionist. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=482.4s)]
*  So we need to understand the creation of buffer zone within that framework, within that wider [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=485.84s)]
*  framework in the shift in Turkish foreign policy in the region. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=491.59999999999997s)]
*  It's risky to approach the Turkish bases, so we've traveled with the Iraqi border guards [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=497.59999999999997s)]
*  to get a closer look. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=502.71999999999997s)]
*  The border guards' job is to protect Iraq's international boundaries. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=509.6s)]
*  It reports to the central government in Baghdad. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=514.16s)]
*  From what we can see, it's almost as if Turkey has pushed the border south and is now in [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=518.9200000000001s)]
*  control of Iraqi territory. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=524.62s)]
*  As part of our investigation, we've created a detailed map of Turkey's military installations [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=539.6s)]
*  in northern Iraq. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=559.12s)]
*  By gathering information from satellite images and social media, we've been able to plot [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=560.64s)]
*  exact positions of Turkey's military outposts and permanent bases. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=566.92s)]
*  What we've found shows the sheer scale of the Turkish presence. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=571.92s)]
*  Our analysis shows that as of December 2024, there were at least 136 Turkish bases on Iraqi [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=576.0s)]
*  soil. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=584.1999999999999s)]
*  It means that you have lost sovereignty over thousands of square kilometers of land. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=586.64s)]
*  These areas are all uninhabited and populated for your information. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=591.88s)]
*  And the reason again was the PKK who denied our people to go back to their homes. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=598.08s)]
*  So it's a no man land. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=606.78s)]
*  So you're saying that there are no civilians in this land? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=609.48s)]
*  No, no, there are in between some civilians, but they will not interfere in their day-to-day [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=611.64s)]
*  work, in their business, in their communication, going to their fields and so on. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=616.92s)]
*  The border guards try to project an image of strength, but Turkey is a regional powerhouse [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=625.2s)]
*  on which Iraq depends for trade, investment and water security. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=631.0s)]
*  The Baghdad government has little leverage to expel Turkish troops. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=636.04s)]
*  In the meantime, families like Alain's continue to seek justice. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=647.68s)]
*  The family is also seeking compensation from the central Iraqi government. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=662.2s)]
*  Much will depend on whether Alain's death certificate states the true cause of his death. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=667.5200000000001s)]
*  But it was written by the local Kurdish authorities and Ismail has his doubts. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=675.32s)]
*  The certificate says only that explosive fragments caused Alain's death, not that he was killed [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=692.2s)]
*  in an act of war. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=717.1600000000001s)]
*  The BBC has obtained confidential documents relating to Alain's case. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=718.96s)]
*  The original police report, filed on the day of the strike, says a Turkish drone was responsible. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=742.2s)]
*  But as the case advanced through the court system, all references to Turkey disappeared. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=750.9200000000001s)]
*  The investigative court sent this letter requesting an autopsy. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=757.5600000000001s)]
*  The accident type is described not as a Turkish attack, but as explosive fragments. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=763.08s)]
*  The very same wording that later appears in Alain's death certificate. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=769.08s)]
*  These documents suggest the Kurdish authorities may have acted to cover up the true cause of death. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=776.8000000000001s)]
*  And Alain's case is not the only one. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=784.08s)]
*  Kamaran has collected the death certificates of 250 people he believes were killed in Turkish strikes. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=787.48s)]
*  Only three of these certificates cite Turkish bombardment as the cause of death. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=795.48s)]
*  So it seems that there is a concerted effort by Kurdish authorities to obstruct anybody [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=824.16s)]
*  who tries to bring Turkey to account. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=830.16s)]
*  There is no question about that, definitely. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=833.36s)]
*  The judge ruled that the perpetrator's identity was unknown and closed the case. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=854.16s)]
*  Alain's family are still waiting, if not for compensation, then at least for acknowledgement. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=866.56s)]
*  The BBC asked the Turkish Ministry of National Defence for more information about the incident. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=878.28s)]
*  They denied having carried out a strike on that day. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3kQdkQSGA4&t=884.88s)]
