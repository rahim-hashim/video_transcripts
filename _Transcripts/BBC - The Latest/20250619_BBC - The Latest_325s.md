*  Rushdie, tell us a little more in terms of what you are hearing has happened on the ground. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=55.14s)]
*  A very intense Israeli airstrike started early morning with bombing about five houses in [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=64.14s)]
*  Jabalia town in the north where about 14, 15 people were killed and many others were [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=70.3s)]
*  missing under the building according to the Hamas control civil defence agency. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=75.98s)]
*  Straight away after that, Gaza City, the biggest city in the entire of Gaza Strip, has witnessed [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=82.82s)]
*  about 10, 12 airstrikes, very unusual number of airstrikes. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=88.66s)]
*  For about a week we have seen less intense Israeli airstrikes following the escalation [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=93.97999999999999s)]
*  with Iran, but today is completely different. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=101.02s)]
*  In Shata refugee camp, the beach camp west of Gaza, it's a very crowded area. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=104.1s)]
*  Most of the people who were evacuated from the north following the Israeli operation [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=110.98s)]
*  were taking shelters in that camp. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=116.06s)]
*  About 23 people were killed, many others were injured. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=118.78s)]
*  I have seen a video shared by like activists in the place showing bodies in the ground [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=122.18s)]
*  including a girl and a boy at least were shown in the videos. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=129.70000000000002s)]
*  The hospitals are overwhelmed by the number of injuries and airstrikes is everywhere. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=137.26000000000002s)]
*  People describe it to me just now in Gaza City as if the war has just started. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=141.62s)]
*  Has there been any response from the IDF, the Israeli authorities? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=148.66000000000003s)]
*  Well, I haven't seen any comment yet, but you know some of the local residents and local [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=153.9s)]
*  activists in Gaza linked this to a sudden, you know, the ploy of Hamas police, some of [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=165.1s)]
*  them in civilian uniforms, some of them in masks in the street. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=173.54s)]
*  They try to regain control, taking the leverage of the Israeli busy with Iran now and the [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=177.34s)]
*  number of Israeli drones that is monitoring Gaza day and night, they are significantly [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=185.74s)]
*  less than before the escalation with Iran. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=190.66s)]
*  So Hamas is trying to regain its control of wide areas because for the last like two [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=194.1s)]
*  or three months Israel was bombing any sort of Hamas police units or any Hamas militants [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=200.46s)]
*  trying to regain control. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=206.98s)]
*  So they try to regain the control in Gaza. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=208.98s)]
*  Some of the people linked the latest big Israeli strikes to this. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=213.06s)]
*  As we said in the introduction, included in those numbers apparently 23 people near an [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=219.26s)]
*  aid distribution site. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=225.42s)]
*  Only yesterday, Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=227.22s)]
*  UNRWA has said, it is now routine, I'm reading a quote directly, it is now the routine to [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=232.06s)]
*  shoot and kill desperate and starving people while they try to collect food. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=237.1s)]
*  There is alarm certainly from the UN and other agencies, just the normalisation now [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=242.34s)]
*  about these incidents so close to the aid distribution site. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=249.3s)]
*  Yes because simply what is happening is that every day trucks coming from Israeli side, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=256.58s)]
*  Israeli control border and as soon as they come off the crossings close to the Israeli [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=262.18s)]
*  thousands of people, thousands of hungry people would rush to take any food from this. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=268.82s)]
*  In the south it's a little bit better because there is four or five centres distributing [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=275.42s)]
*  food but these areas are also under Israeli control in Rafah and in Kanyounis and the [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=283.65999999999997s)]
*  killing of people near centres has become a daily routine. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=292.58s)]
*  Every day we have people killed, yesterday there was 12, 13 in Gaza, the day before was [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=296.22s)]
*  the biggest, about 51 were killed. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=302.18s)]
*  The Hamas run civil defence agency said more than 450 people so far killed within the last [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=305.5s)]
*  two weeks, just people hungry trying to get food. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=314.18s)]
*  Rushdie, we will leave it there, we will return if there are any more details. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=317.90000000000003s)]
*  Thanks very much for the latest on that breaking development. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJyAEfOkL0&t=321.42s)]
