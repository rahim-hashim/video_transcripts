Video Description: The idea of a large truck barrelling down the highway, carrying a heavy load, and without a driver’s hands on the steering wheel may seem strange and even frightening to some. 
 
But, in China, this is now being tested. Along certain routes, driverless trucks are being allowed to operate under supervision and – when it comes to smaller driverless delivery vans – they are already sharing the streets with human-controlled vehicles.
 
China Correspondent Stephen McDonell reports from Beijing and the Eastern Chinese city of Hefei.

# China launches fleet of self-driving trucks | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypj2ii--1Uc)
*  The idea of a large truck barreling down the highway, carrying a heavy load and without a driver's hands on the steering wheel [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypj2ii--1Uc&t=0.0s)]
*  may seem strange and even frightening to some. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypj2ii--1Uc&t=7.0s)]
*  Well, in China that is exactly what's now being tested. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypj2ii--1Uc&t=10.0s)]
*  Along certain routes, driverless lorries are being allowed to operate under supervision. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypj2ii--1Uc&t=13.0s)]
*  And when it comes to smaller delivery vans, they're already sharing the streets with human-controlled vehicles. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypj2ii--1Uc&t=18.0s)]
*  Our China correspondent, Stephen MacDonald, reports. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypj2ii--1Uc&t=24.0s)]
*  These trucks are driving on a public road without a human being behind the wheel. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypj2ii--1Uc&t=28.0s)]
*  Driverless transport company Pony AI was given official permission to film a video showing just what its technology can do. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypj2ii--1Uc&t=33.0s)]
*  Now it's running a pilot program making deliveries from Beijing to Tianjin Port, which the company showed to the BBC. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypj2ii--1Uc&t=43.0s)]
*  So here we have one of these self-driving trucks from the outside. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypj2ii--1Uc&t=51.0s)]
*  So the outside looks like a normal truck. Let's have a look. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypj2ii--1Uc&t=54.0s)]
*  The normal runs involve a safety driver ready to take over in an emergency. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypj2ii--1Uc&t=61.0s)]
*  So here we are, we're racing down the freeway and I've got to say it's pretty weird because you look over, there's the driver, his hands are off the steering wheel. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypj2ii--1Uc&t=67.0s)]
*  Of course I was a bit scared the first time in an autonomous truck, but after spending a lot of time testing them, I think they are pretty good and safe. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypj2ii--1Uc&t=75.0s)]
*  I asked how the truck's sensors work. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypj2ii--1Uc&t=89.0s)]
*  This is our main sensor. It uses lasers which can reach a long way. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypj2ii--1Uc&t=92.0s)]
*  There are also cameras which can track in multiple directions to detect blind spots. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypj2ii--1Uc&t=96.0s)]
*  These test vehicles are running daily limited routes. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypj2ii--1Uc&t=101.0s)]
*  But elsewhere much smaller trucks have already been cleared to operate freely on suburban streets. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypj2ii--1Uc&t=106.0s)]
*  In the eastern city of Hefei, Rhino AI is taking parcels from big distribution hubs run by courier companies to neighbourhood stations where scooter drivers then drop packages to the front door. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypj2ii--1Uc&t=114.0s)]
*  We're told that delivery companies can hire three robot vans for the same cost as one driver's salary. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypj2ii--1Uc&t=128.0s)]
*  The driverless vehicle industry is growing really really quickly. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypj2ii--1Uc&t=139.0s)]
*  Apart from express delivery companies, our customers include supermarkets, hospitals and universities. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypj2ii--1Uc&t=143.0s)]
*  Worldwide, much has to be done to convince the public that it's safe to allow powerful heavy trucks on normal streets without a driver. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypj2ii--1Uc&t=151.0s)]
*  But in China at least, analysts say this could be widespread within years rather than decades. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypj2ii--1Uc&t=161.0s)]
