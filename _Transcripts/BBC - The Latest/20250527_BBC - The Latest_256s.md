Video Description: A controversial new aid distribution group backed by the US and Israel has begun working in Gaza.
 
The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) said lorry loads of food had been delivered to secure sites and that it had begun distribution to people. It did not say where or how much aid had been handed out.
 
The group, which uses armed American security contractors, aims to bypass the UN as the main supplier of aid to the 2.1 million Palestinians in Gaza, where experts are warning of a looming famine after an Israeli blockade that lasted 11 weeks.
 
The UN and many aid groups have refused to co-operate with GHF's plans, which they say contradict humanitarian principles and appear to "weaponise aid".

**BBC - The Latest:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lm3B4xgv1A)
*  An American and Israeli-backed aid supply group says it's started operations in Gaza, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lm3B4xgv1A&t=0.0s)]
*  delivering truckloads of food to so-called secure distribution sites. The Gaza Humanitarian [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lm3B4xgv1A&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  Foundation, which uses armed American security contractors, aims to bypass the United Nations [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lm3B4xgv1A&t=10.56s)]
*  as the major aid supplier to Palestinians. It's already seen its own executive director [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lm3B4xgv1A&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  resign in protest amid mounting concerns over the project. The foundation says it delivered [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lm3B4xgv1A&t=20.56s)]
*  truckloads of food to its secure sites on Monday, where distribution began to people [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lm3B4xgv1A&t=26.36s)]
*  in Gaza, although it isn't saying how many trucks were involved. The project has been [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lm3B4xgv1A&t=30.88s)]
*  controversial, seen by critics as politicising and militarising aid and using food distribution [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lm3B4xgv1A&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  to kettle Palestinians into diminishingly smaller areas, with selective distribution [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lm3B4xgv1A&t=41.64s)]
*  used to starve out Israel's adversaries. The foundation rejects the criticism, saying [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lm3B4xgv1A&t=47.04s)]
*  its operations conform to the humanitarian principle of neutrality. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lm3B4xgv1A&t=51.68s)]
*  Let's go live now to our Middle East correspondent, Yulanda Nell. This new aid operation is underway. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lm3B4xgv1A&t=55.84s)]
*  Do we have any more information about how it's going? We haven't heard any more today [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lm3B4xgv1A&t=61.68s)]
*  about aid reaching these new secure hubs, as the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation refers [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lm3B4xgv1A&t=68.6s)]
*  to them. There are four. We're expecting initially three of them in the south of Gaza, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lm3B4xgv1A&t=75.44s)]
*  one in the centre. And the foundation is insisting that it's planning to reach more than a million [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lm3B4xgv1A&t=81.88s)]
*  Palestinians within the next week. So that would be half of the population of Gaza. All [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lm3B4xgv1A&t=89.2s)]
*  that we saw so far in a couple of official photographs that were put out, the most I [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lm3B4xgv1A&t=94.84s)]
*  could count was about a dozen men, apparently Palestinian, carrying away boxes. And we [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lm3B4xgv1A&t=99.68s)]
*  saw also some lorries with boxes on them from a small US-based NGO that had been transported [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lm3B4xgv1A&t=107.4s)]
*  into the Gaza Strip. Now, the UN and most UN agencies that have been working on the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lm3B4xgv1A&t=116.80000000000001s)]
*  Gaza humanitarian crisis have been refusing to work with this newly created foundation. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lm3B4xgv1A&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  They see it as both unethical and unworkable. And they've accused Israel of using food [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lm3B4xgv1A&t=128.72s)]
*  as a weapon and also using it as bait to try to fit in with the military strategy of forcing [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lm3B4xgv1A&t=135.76s)]
*  Palestinians in Gaza to move to the south. And, you know, it's not clear at the moment [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lm3B4xgv1A&t=142.4s)]
*  whether this will be effective. Israel says that a new system is urgently needed to stop [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lm3B4xgv1A&t=149.8s)]
*  Hamas from stealing supplies for its own benefit. And that's something that the UN [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lm3B4xgv1A&t=156.0s)]
*  has said is not happening in a meaningful way. At the same time, we've been hearing [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lm3B4xgv1A&t=163.12s)]
*  from the UN's humanitarian office some figures suggesting that despite Israel's easing of [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lm3B4xgv1A&t=168.96s)]
*  the blockade, the total blockade imposed on Gaza for 11 weeks, saying this was to pressure [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lm3B4xgv1A&t=175.12s)]
*  Hamas. All we've seen in the past week or so of lorries being allowed to return back [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lm3B4xgv1A&t=180.0s)]
*  to Gaza is about 190 lorryloads, mainly of food, going in. And we're hearing, of course, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lm3B4xgv1A&t=186.16s)]
*  that distribution is very difficult with people just so desperate on the ground. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lm3B4xgv1A&t=192.44s)]
*  And, Yuland, in the meantime, there's also been another development, a missile attack [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lm3B4xgv1A&t=196.48s)]
*  on Israel by the Houthis in Yemen. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lm3B4xgv1A&t=200.8s)]
*  That's right. Sirens went off earlier today, and that's the fourth time in five days that [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lm3B4xgv1A&t=206.0s)]
*  that's happened. The Israeli military saying that it's shot down, a missile and another [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lm3B4xgv1A&t=211.76s)]
*  projectile that will launch separately from Yemen. We've had the Houthis saying that they [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lm3B4xgv1A&t=218.6s)]
*  are acting in solidarity with the Palestinians, although they have agreed with the US to stop [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lm3B4xgv1A&t=224.48s)]
*  their attacks on ships passing in waters going close to Yemen. And, you know, Israel [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lm3B4xgv1A&t=230.76s)]
*  has acted, it's attacked Yemen repeatedly, but we have not seen these strikes stopping. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lm3B4xgv1A&t=238.92s)]
*  It's three weeks ago that Israel hit the main airport in Sana'a, killing several people [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lm3B4xgv1A&t=245.79999999999998s)]
*  and damaging the airport. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lm3B4xgv1A&t=251.76s)]
*  Yuland Nel, thank you very much indeed. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lm3B4xgv1A&t=253.23999999999998s)]
