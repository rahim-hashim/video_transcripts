**BBC - The Latest:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I-jS4ZlcF8)
*  Those who served with UK Special Forces are about to break a code of silence. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I-jS4ZlcF8&t=0.0s)]
*  They don't want to be identified. We've used actors to speak their words. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I-jS4ZlcF8&t=7.0s)]
*  But they want the world to know what they saw. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I-jS4ZlcF8&t=12.0s)]
*  Everyone knew what was going on. It's not Scout Camp. Everyone knew what was happening. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I-jS4ZlcF8&t=15.0s)]
*  People were murdered. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I-jS4ZlcF8&t=21.0s)]
*  The government has set up a public inquiry. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I-jS4ZlcF8&t=24.0s)]
*  But it's only looking at operations between 2010 and 2013. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I-jS4ZlcF8&t=28.0s)]
*  We've been told the unlawful killings started much earlier. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I-jS4ZlcF8&t=33.0s)]
*  In Iraq. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I-jS4ZlcF8&t=39.0s)]
*  There was one operation where the blokes had clearly executed a man. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I-jS4ZlcF8&t=41.0s)]
*  It's disgraceful. There's no professionalism in that. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I-jS4ZlcF8&t=47.0s)]
*  The killing was at its worst in Afghanistan. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I-jS4ZlcF8&t=54.0s)]
*  British soldiers were being killed in Helmand. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I-jS4ZlcF8&t=58.0s)]
*  Special forces were sent in to stop the Taliban fighters and bomb makers. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I-jS4ZlcF8&t=61.0s)]
*  The public inquiry has only been looking at allegations about the SAS. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I-jS4ZlcF8&t=69.0s)]
*  The eyewitnesses we've spoken to say the Navy Special Forces, the SBS, committed war crimes too. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I-jS4ZlcF8&t=75.0s)]
*  I can't recall us taking a single injured insurgent back to base for treatment. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I-jS4ZlcF8&t=83.0s)]
*  They were shot. There and then. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I-jS4ZlcF8&t=88.0s)]
*  Under British and international law, troops can't deliberately kill unarmed civilians or prisoners of war. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I-jS4ZlcF8&t=93.0s)]
*  But the eyewitnesses say they saw the execution of detainees, including children. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I-jS4ZlcF8&t=100.0s)]
*  They handcuffed a young boy and shot him. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I-jS4ZlcF8&t=108.0s)]
*  He was clearly a child. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I-jS4ZlcF8&t=113.0s)]
*  Not even close to fighting age. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I-jS4ZlcF8&t=117.0s)]
*  I couldn't believe what they were doing. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I-jS4ZlcF8&t=121.0s)]
*  These are murderers. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I-jS4ZlcF8&t=125.0s)]
*  They should all be locked up. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I-jS4ZlcF8&t=128.0s)]
*  The Ministry of Defence says it supports the independent inquiry. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I-jS4ZlcF8&t=132.0s)]
*  And it is not appropriate to comment on allegations which may be within its scope. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I-jS4ZlcF8&t=137.0s)]
*  The eyewitnesses say they are proud to have served in the British Armed Forces. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I-jS4ZlcF8&t=144.0s)]
*  But they can no longer keep quiet about the terrible things they saw. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I-jS4ZlcF8&t=149.0s)]
