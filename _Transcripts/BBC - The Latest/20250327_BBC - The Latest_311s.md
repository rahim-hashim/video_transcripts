Video Description: "It took a huge amount of courage to speak out.‚Äù

The BBC did two interviews with NewJeans, before and after a court blocked their attempt to leave their record label, in a case that rocked the K-pop industry.

NewJeans made a decision in November to part ways with Ador, the label that launched them. Hanni, Hyein, Haerin, Danielle, and Minji's move caught the attention of South Korea and fans worldwide.

They alleged mistreatment, workplace harassment and an attempt to "undermine their careers", which Ador denies. It sued to enforce their seven-year contract, which is set to expire in 2029, and sought an injunction against any commercial activities by the group.

On Friday, a South Korean court granted it, ordering NewJeans to stop all "independent" activities, including song releases and advertising deals, while the case was still under way. NewJeans has since challenged the injunction in court.

Friday's ruling was a "shock", the group told the BBC.

**BBC - The Latest:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg)
*  Some people welcome the court's decisions, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=0.0s)]
*  like saying you're taking the contract relationships too lightly. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=3.2s)]
*  How would you respond to these people? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  I don't know, I really tried to keep quiet about everything, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=11.0s)]
*  try and just ignore. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  I feel like I'm about to explode and heartbreaking in a way. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=16.2s)]
*  Not being able to do this work, I think, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  that's such an obvious biggest fear for us. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=25.0s)]
*  What are your thoughts on the decision? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=30.0s)]
*  As big as the decisions we've made in the past year have been, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=35.0s)]
*  all been decided through a very, very large amount of discussion between us. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=39.0s)]
*  And I'll be completely honest, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=46.0s)]
*  we're not that comfortable about constantly bringing up this situation [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=48.0s)]
*  because we know that it involves another team [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=53.0s)]
*  and we don't want anything to... [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=56.0s)]
*  we don't want to affect that team in any way [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=58.0s)]
*  because there's no need for that. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=61.0s)]
*  There really is no need for that. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=64.0s)]
*  But if you don't express how you're feeling and what you're thinking, people don't know. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=66.0s)]
*  People would have just believed what was going on in the media. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=70.0s)]
*  Every time we have to speak out, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=74.0s)]
*  we have to deal with our own stories in many places. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=76.0s)]
*  Of course, it was scary, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=80.0s)]
*  and it's something that worries me a lot in my life. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=82.0s)]
*  What are your thoughts on the decision? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=86.0s)]
*  Given the rumors, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=98.0s)]
*  there's a saying that there are influential adults behind the scenes. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=100.0s)]
*  So I want to know how much input you have in decisions, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=104.0s)]
*  like the legal matters. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=109.0s)]
*  Because we're really young, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=111.0s)]
*  in a way, that's an easy way to kind of devalue the fact that [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=113.0s)]
*  we are actually trying to do something about this issue. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=118.0s)]
*  It's just easy to kind of be like, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=122.0s)]
*  they're young, we just think they're not doing that by themselves. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=124.0s)]
*  But that doesn't mean that we're any less serious [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=128.0s)]
*  or any less concerned about this situation. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=131.0s)]
*  That's not the scenario at all. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=134.0s)]
*  We've always said to each other, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=137.0s)]
*  if one person doesn't want to do it, then we're not going to do it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=139.0s)]
*  It has to be all five of us that agree to do it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=141.0s)]
*  In 2024, when I was going through that situation myself, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=144.0s)]
*  I really, I don't know, I really tried to keep quiet about everything, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=150.0s)]
*  and I really tried to compress my emotions, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=154.0s)]
*  try and just ignore what's happening around me, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=157.0s)]
*  because it started in a situation where we were preparing for a comeback. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=161.0s)]
*  But it came to a point where [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=165.0s)]
*  I feel like I'm about to explode inside [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=169.0s)]
*  and heartbreaking in a way. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=173.0s)]
*  I was obviously expecting the alternative results, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=188.0s)]
*  but yeah, so I think it was like a moment [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=194.0s)]
*  where we were all really just like kind of in shock and... [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=197.0s)]
*  I guess we just really wanted to be able to work [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=224.0s)]
*  and to be able to do the work that we love [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=231.0s)]
*  without these misleading and false lies getting in the way. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=234.0s)]
*  We all have to work together, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=239.0s)]
*  and I think that's the reason why we're so proud of ourselves. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=242.0s)]
*  We're all going to be able to do it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=247.0s)]
*  I think that's such an obvious, biggest fear for us. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=250.0s)]
*  That's why we're pushing forward. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=254.0s)]
*  But it is something that is in the back of my mind, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=257.0s)]
*  because anything is possible. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=260.0s)]
*  We did not know we were going to go through this. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=262.0s)]
*  Maybe we were trainees, we had no idea. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=264.0s)]
*  We were just like, oh, we're going to go through this. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=266.0s)]
*  We were like, oh, we're going to go through this. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=269.0s)]
*  We were just like, oh, we're going to go through this. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=272.0s)]
*  We were like, oh, we're going to go through this. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=275.0s)]
*  Maybe we were trainees, we had no idea we were going to go through anything like this. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=278.0s)]
*  But we don't know what's in the future, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=282.0s)]
*  and maybe there might be a case where we're not able to work, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=284.0s)]
*  and that is something that we want to avoid, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=288.0s)]
*  because that is, I wouldn't say fear, but it's just we... [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=291.0s)]
*  In any way possible, we don't want to fall down that road. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=294.0s)]
*  you [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwkj0_0B3Gg&t=308.0s)]
