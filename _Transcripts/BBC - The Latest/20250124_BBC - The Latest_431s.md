# Storm Éowyn brings 100mph gusts as one million without power across UK and Ireland | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI)
*  Hello and welcome to BBC News. Storm Aowyn has brought potentially life threatening winds [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=0.0s)]
*  to Ireland and the UK with the loss of power and services and the closure of schools, rail [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=6.84s)]
*  ferries, roads and transport hubs. Millions have been urged to stay at home as a rare [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=12.6s)]
*  red warning for Northern Ireland and the Scottish central belt is in place which means danger [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=18.04s)]
*  to life. Many schools and large parts of the transport network are also closed in those [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=24.16s)]
*  areas. As you can see from this map, it's a giant storm where coastal areas could see [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=29.64s)]
*  winds of more than 100 mph. An amber weather warning is in place for the rest of Scotland, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  Northern England and Northern Wales. Well, in a moment we will talk to our correspondent [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=41.4s)]
*  David Wallace Lockhart who's there in Glasgow for us. First though, let's get this report [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=48.2s)]
*  on all the latest from Chris Page. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=52.6s)]
*  After gathering force over the sea, Storm Aowyn hit Ireland with its full fierceness. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=57.08s)]
*  Early this morning, winds which were already strong turned savage. At Galway Aquarium, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  the gusts pushed floodwater into the car park. Further north, the town of Westport in County [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=69.58s)]
*  Mayo took its share of the battering. Looking out to sea, the winds are at their maximum [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=75.56s)]
*  strength and it's obviously too dangerous to go outside into a storm of that ferocity [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=80.76s)]
*  so we're sheltering in a tunnel. The west coast of Ireland is particularly exposed to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=87.5s)]
*  storms rolling in across the Atlantic Ocean. There have been plenty of them over the years [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=92.72s)]
*  but people in Westport are saying today they've never seen anything as bad as Storm Aowyn. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=98.38000000000001s)]
*  Today's been a struggle for anyone who's had to go out. Roads are dangerous with thousands [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=105.82000000000001s)]
*  of trees down, public transport's off, airports are open but hundreds of flights have been [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=111.38s)]
*  cancelled. We're expecting flight operations to return to normal schedule by mid-afternoon [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=117.54s)]
*  but that's weather permitting so it's important that passengers before they come out to the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=122.74000000000001s)]
*  airport continue to check with their airlines just to get the latest up-to-date information [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=126.9s)]
*  on their flight. For the first time, a red weather warning has been issued across the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=130.68s)]
*  whole island of Ireland. That means on both sides of the Irish border, all schools are [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=135.84s)]
*  closed. Many businesses are allowing staff to work from home. The emergency services [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=141.48s)]
*  say the vast majority of people are staying inside. We're really thankful that the public [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=147.17999999999998s)]
*  have taken that public safety advice about trying to stay at home and reduce their travel [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=152.26s)]
*  so we'll continue to reiterate that advice around don't travel unless you absolutely [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=156.66s)]
*  need to. Pictures like these show what a storm of this magnitude can do. In County [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=162.06s)]
*  Tyrone in Northern Ireland, farms and houses have suffered damage. And in County Down, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=168.56s)]
*  this leisure centre in Bangor has taken a hit from the extreme gales. After a morning [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=174.88s)]
*  of disruption, the scale of the destruction will only become clear after Storm Aowyn [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=180.82s)]
*  has blown through. Chris Page, BBC News. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=186.42000000000002s)]
*  Let's get out there on the ground. I hope to speak to Ben Schofield, who is in Manchester [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=190.82s)]
*  in a moment or two. Let's first go to David Wallace Lockhart, who is in Scotland. David, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=194.9s)]
*  I was looking at the pictures only an hour or so ago. It looks pretty rough where you [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=199.45999999999998s)]
*  are. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=203.45999999999998s)]
*  Yes, it is. I'm in Glasgow but in South Lanarkshire, not a million miles from here, we have had [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=204.45999999999998s)]
*  winds of over 100 miles per hour recorded. For a bit of context, we're actually shielded [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=211.34s)]
*  by quite a big building where we're currently standing. But about 50 yards up the road, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=218.02s)]
*  there was a group of people just a few minutes ago. One got knocked over by the wind, their [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=222.34s)]
*  hat came right off and straight into the River Clyde, which when you look at it, it's more [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=226.66000000000003s)]
*  like the sea today than it is actually like a river. And this particular bridge that's [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=231.22s)]
*  over the Clyde, you can actually look, it's got plastic sheets as part of its roofing. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=237.70000000000002s)]
*  And we've been watching as some of them have actually got ripped off. So that's giving [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=242.42000000000002s)]
*  you a sort of sense of the kind of damage that this storm is already doing, the kind [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=246.4s)]
*  of strength of wind that we're seeing. Now, there's been disruption. There's no trains [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=252.28s)]
*  today across Scotland. We're not actually going to have trains until at least midday [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=258.68s)]
*  tomorrow. That's even though this red warning is due to end at five o'clock. Massive disruption [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=264.0s)]
*  to flights from airports, massive disruptions to the ferry service in Scotland as well. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=269.44s)]
*  It does feel by and large like people have really paid attention to that stay at home [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=274.96s)]
*  message that's come out from the authorities. Of course, people getting one of those emergency [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=280.76s)]
*  alerts on their phone. Many people in Scotland getting that yesterday evening, telling them [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=285.88s)]
*  only to be travelling if it was absolutely necessary. There has been widespread disruption. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=291.2s)]
*  There's been trees falling onto roads. There's been power cuts in parts of Scotland as well. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=298.35999999999996s)]
*  And it's really stressing why this is one of those red warnings that comes with that [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=304.18s)]
*  risk to life warning that comes with it, because these are pretty strong winds we're experiencing. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=309.58s)]
*  Glasgow, a city that's used to the wind, but not on a level like this. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=316.58s)]
*  David, thanks very much. Well, as promised, let's go to Ben Schofield. He's in Manchester [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=320.74s)]
*  for us. And Ben, give me an idea of what it's like where you are. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=325.98s)]
*  Welcome to a rather sunny but also very blustery West Yorkshire. We're over the M62 here, not [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=332.94s)]
*  far from Huddersfield, somewhere called Ainley Top, which is a lovely beauty spot. It's just [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=339.7s)]
*  over there to my left. As you can see, the traffic is flowing rather well in this part [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=343.5s)]
*  of the world. The M62 heads off towards Manchester in that direction. It becomes the highest [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=348.58000000000004s)]
*  motorway in England as it travels west. Now, there are parts of the major road network [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=353.3s)]
*  that are closed today. The Humber Bridge and the Severn crossing as well have been closed [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=359.9s)]
*  to high sided vehicles at least, if not more traffic as well. The A66 or so, which links [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=367.3s)]
*  Scotch Corner on the A1 with Carlisle and Penrith over on the M6, is closed to all traffic [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=373.5s)]
*  today, not just high sided vehicles. That was closed from midnight overnight. And you [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=381.74s)]
*  can see why. There are at least four reports of overturned lorries on the roads in the [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=386.1s)]
*  north of England today, one of which was on the A19 in County Durham. There was another [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=392.26000000000005s)]
*  on the M6 near Carlisle and two that I've seen reported by Highways England, one by [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=398.1s)]
*  Darlington, another near Durham. So there is real jeopardy out there on the roads. Drivers [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=404.18s)]
*  here seem to be taking it as safely as possible. The advice from Highways England is to slow [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=409.92s)]
*  down in case of debris to avoid exposed stretches of road and of course to keep both hands on [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=416.09999999999997s)]
*  the wheel in case of gusts like the one we are experiencing now. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=421.65999999999997s)]
*  Ben Wallace there just outside Manchester. Thanks very much indeed. Thank you. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxRPNhHd1MI&t=427.14s)]
