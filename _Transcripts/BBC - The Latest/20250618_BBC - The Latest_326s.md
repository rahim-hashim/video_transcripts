Video Description: French police are struggling to halt a potentially record-breaking surge of people from reaching the UK in small boats organised by a growing network of smuggling gangs. 
 
Downing Street has said the situation is “deteriorating."
 
Although the French authorities claim they’re now intercepting more than two thirds of those boats before they reach the sea, the smugglers are now changing tactics to launch so-called “taxi-boats” from new sites, in new ways, and with ever greater speed. 
 
Instead of inflating their boats in the dunes along the coast, close to police patrols, the gangs are launching them from better hidden locations, often dozens of kilometres from the main departure beaches. 
 
They then cruise along the coastline, like taxis or buses, picking up their paying customers who now wait in the sea, out of reach of the police.
 
Andrew Harding reports from Calais.

# Smuggling gangs switch tactics to use 'taxi boats' for journeys across the Channel | BBC News

*  Downing Street says the small boats situation in the English Channel is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=0.0s)]
*  deteriorating. French police are struggling to hold a potentially [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=4.2s)]
*  record-breaking surge of people from reaching the UK in small boats, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=7.84s)]
*  organised by a growing network of smuggling gangs. More than 16 and a half [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=11.64s)]
*  thousand people have crossed the channel this year alone. That's up 45% on the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=16.46s)]
*  same period last year. Andrew Harding has been to the beaches of [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=21.12s)]
*  northern France to see the challenge faced by the authorities as smuggling [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=24.28s)]
*  gangs change their tactics. A serene stretch of French sand south of Calais [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=28.68s)]
*  and the end of another busy night. Below some of the many hundreds of people [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=36.76s)]
*  who've been trying to dodge the police and catch a ride on a smuggler's boat [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=43.12s)]
*  and here's how that struggle has been playing out. Moments early on the very [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=47.64s)]
*  same beach, dozens of migrants gathering in the shallows. Camerawoman Lea Gedge [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=54.12s)]
*  and I wade out towards them. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  The boat circles, people waiting their turn as if queuing for a bus or a taxi. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=66.28s)]
*  On board the man on the left appears to be directing things. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=73.4s)]
*  Moving forwards to try and get on board. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=79.8s)]
*  Are you going to get on? Yeah. You go to England? Yeah. Last on, families, some [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=84.67999999999999s)]
*  struggling. There are people here from Afghanistan, Eritrea. The so-called taxi [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=92.52s)]
*  boat system is the smuggler's latest tactic. They launch the boats in secret [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=100.11999999999999s)]
*  sometimes up to a hundred kilometres away then cruise along the coast picking [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=106.48s)]
*  up passengers and avoiding the police. This is the problem for the French police. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=112.08s)]
*  As soon as these migrants are in the water the police say they cannot [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=118.56s)]
*  intervene. And so 18 police officers stand and watch. What would you say to [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=122.52000000000001s)]
*  people in Britain watching these pictures and thinking surely the French [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=131.48000000000002s)]
*  police can do more? The police will be able to be more effective when our [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=135.64s)]
*  government changes the rules to authorise us to intercept a boat when [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=141.88s)]
*  it's already in the water. But we need to be careful not to put the migrants, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=145.76s)]
*  including children, in more danger. It's been clear for days that another surge [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=149.92s)]
*  of small boat crossings was coming. A build-up of people in the camps, good [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=156.67999999999998s)]
*  weather forecast. And so a last proper meal for Luna from Somalia before she [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=162.08s)]
*  sets off again. How many times have you tried to cross? Me I tried 12 times. Can [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=169.76000000000002s)]
*  you swim? No I don't swim. It's risky. Sometimes a boat is very far. That's why [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  women and children left so many times behind. So the men clamber on board the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=185.16000000000003s)]
*  boat. Yeah. It's harder for you. Yeah it's harder for us. Afternoon and the crowds [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=190.36s)]
*  cram into buses guided by their smugglers to be dropped off along a [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=196.24s)]
*  huge stretch of French coastline. Nighttime and the French police are [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=201.84s)]
*  getting good at spotting the migrants with their drones. The camera picking up [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=209.56s)]
*  people sitting around a fire. But as so often the smugglers are a step ahead. And [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=214.88s)]
*  now frustrating news reaches the police. Up the coast this car has just raced [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=223.56s)]
*  onto the beach itself with a taxi boat strapped to the roof ready to launch in [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  seconds. Too quick for the police. So the smugglers are adapting again. But it's [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=237.96s)]
*  not over. The police are now trying to catch the smugglers before they can pick [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=248.60000000000002s)]
*  up any passengers. So we're now racing up the coast following the police as they [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=252.68s)]
*  try to track the taxi boat which is already at sea and we can actually see [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=259.32s)]
*  it off the coast just there. There's a group of migrants up ahead. They're waiting in the water [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=265.12s)]
*  hoping to catch a taxi boat which we can see arriving just now. Within minutes [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=273.28000000000003s)]
*  dozens of people have managed to squeeze on board and the taxi boat sets off [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=282.88s)]
*  towards England. The French police say overall they stop more than two-thirds [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=287.64s)]
*  of small boat launches on land but the smugglers are still winning. On this [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=295.0s)]
*  occasion perhaps a dozen people are left behind. One couple pondering wordlessly [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=302.04s)]
*  whether to linger or to head back to shore. The lure of Britain means most [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=309.44s)]
*  here will try again and again. Andrew Harding, BBC News, Northern France. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPhkXmnleI&t=317.32s)]
