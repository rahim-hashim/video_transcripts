Video Description: US President Donald Trump has said he is recommending a 50% tariff on all goods from the European Union being imported to the United States.
 
He also threatened to impose a 25% import tax "at least" on iPhones not manufactured in America.
 
"I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone's that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else," Trump said.
 
Today’s announcements mark an escalation of Trump's trade war with the EU, after he initially proposed a 20% tariff on most EU goods, but halved it to 10% until 8 July to allow time for talks.

# US President Trump threatens 50% tariffs on EU and 25% on iPhones | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA)
*  Hello and welcome to Business Today. We'll be live in New York this hour where we're [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=0.0s)]
*  watching the markets because President Trump has said he is recommending a new 50% tariff [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=4.92s)]
*  on all imports from the European Union, dramatically raising the tensions in his global trade war. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=9.92s)]
*  That came just a short time ago via True Social, his own social media network, and it comes [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=16.16s)]
*  despite a recent pause on tariffs for 90 days. We're still well within that window. Lamenting [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=21.2s)]
*  on True Social that negotiations with the EU are going nowhere, the US president pledged [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=28.08s)]
*  to bring that new tariff starting on June 1st, that is just nine days from now. The [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=33.72s)]
*  president also threatened to impose a 25% import tax on Apple iPhones, not manufactured [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=39.4s)]
*  in America. So let's get some reaction. We can speak to the trade expert, Ashleigh Berg, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=46.04s)]
*  from the Centre for European Reform. He's frustrated. It's taking too long with the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  European Union, but it is more difficult negotiating with 27 countries. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=56.36s)]
*  It really is. And this has been a longstanding issue. The EU has not been willing to budge. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=60.68000000000001s)]
*  The EU is dedicated to the global trade order, the predictable rules that we've had. And [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=68.56s)]
*  for them, it's very hard to make this sort of quick and dirty deal that the UK made, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  for instance. The EU cannot accept this 10% tariff, general tariff, and then 25% on cars. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=78.56s)]
*  So it's much harder to reach a compromise with the EU than it was with the UK, for instance. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=90.08s)]
*  What do you make of the timing? Because there is a phone call due in the next few hours [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=95.56s)]
*  between Maroš Sefkević, the European trade negotiator, and his American counterpart. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=100.08s)]
*  Is this time to influence that? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=104.84s)]
*  I think it is. I think we have to keep in mind that at this point, this is a threat. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=107.28s)]
*  It's not an announcement. There's no executive order. At this point, there is nothing coming [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=110.56s)]
*  on June 1st. It's just a threat. And it is a way to increase leverage in advance of negotiations, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=116.88s)]
*  in advance of trade talks. But the fact of the matter is the EU is not going to budge [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=123.72s)]
*  based on this. They're going to stay calm, carry on, stick to their positions. And it [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=130.0s)]
*  will be a very difficult discussion this afternoon. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=136.28s)]
*  A lot of the car companies here in Europe have revised their forecasts. They can't give [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=138.4s)]
*  too much detail on what they're expecting the next year because this changes from day [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=144.28s)]
*  to day. And this announcement was a very good example of that. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=148.36s)]
*  Yeah, for a while there was this perception that with this 90-day pause, that Trump was [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=152.28s)]
*  backing off, that we would have a bit of quiet and instability. This shows that it's not [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=159.56s)]
*  at all the case. And it's not just about the EU. This does not bode well for the US-China [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=165.36s)]
*  negotiations either, or indeed for any of the other negotiations that the US is trying [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=171.4s)]
*  to do with countries like India and Japan. It just shows that the US has a huge difficulty [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=176.24s)]
*  in actually getting to deals with most countries. So we will have continued instability, continued [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=184.4s)]
*  uncertainty, and the uncertainty itself is not good for the economy in addition to the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=190.72s)]
*  actual cost of the tariffs. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=196.44s)]
*  No, indeed not. Aslak, thank you very much. Good to talk to you again. Well, that announcement [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=197.92s)]
*  triggered a sudden reaction in the European markets, including the globally-focused FTSE [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=202.48s)]
*  100. And with the markets just opening in New York, we can get some analysis now from [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=207.32s)]
*  Geoff Grilles. He's the head of US Cross Markets and Emerging Markets, debt at Egan Asset Management. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=211.67999999999998s)]
*  I get the sense, Geoff, that markets don't really know what to make of this. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=217.56s)]
*  Well, I think you're seeing the negative reaction here in the US Open. It's nice to see that [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=223.28s)]
*  you have a little bit of a flight to quality on US rates, although not in the long end. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  But I think what everyone's trying to figure out is, is this a negotiation? What does this [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=232.52s)]
*  threat mean? And I think we all need to see what comes out further from this. He's deferred [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=236.44s)]
*  to Scott Besson as someone who's going to be doing the negotiations. We'll see if he [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=242.2s)]
*  tends to talk them back down. But I agree, this is going to be a roller coaster. We're going to be [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=246.2s)]
*  on and off again. At some point, though, there is going to be a test on, do the tariffs need or do [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=250.92s)]
*  the threats need to actually be implemented to be able to have some bite? And I think that's when [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=255.96s)]
*  you might get more concerned in the marketplace if we get to that point. Do you think markets price [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=260.2s)]
*  in this uncertainty? Are we getting used to it? Well, it's very interesting, right? We've gone [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=263.8s)]
*  from the April 2nd announcement with the extreme, what is likely the max amount of tariffs, and we've [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=268.68s)]
*  come back to 10% with the 90 day pause. And S&P 500 for the most part is above levels that we had [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=273.88s)]
*  prior to where we were on April 2nd. So the market has come back to what they perceive as normal. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=280.36s)]
*  I think that's a little bit of a concern going into the second half of this year. We'll start [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=285.8s)]
*  getting hard data. The main thing to watch will be earnings to see what the impact has been. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=289.64s)]
*  And negotiations are not done yet. The markets seem to have thought that we at least had a pause [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=295.71999999999997s)]
*  until maybe sometime in July and maybe further than that. Besson told you that it was really for [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=300.52s)]
*  those not negotiating in good faith. And the focus was on the tax bill. Now we're back to at least [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=305.71999999999997s)]
*  looking at tariffs. I think the tax bill is what's really going to drive markets here though for the [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=311.0s)]
*  next couple of months. We do expect the tax bill to get passed sometime by August. And that should [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=314.44s)]
*  be a boost despite the fact that it's going to be higher reduction in income with the tax cuts. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=319.47999999999996s)]
*  But that should be positive for the equity markets. The other concern I think for a lot [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=328.04s)]
*  of investors will be bond yields. They're higher at this point than they were in 2023. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=332.12s)]
*  Will this exacerbate the problem? It definitely brings a concern to the problem. I think it's [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=337.40000000000003s)]
*  very helpful though because it keeps the administration somewhat in check. I think [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=342.12s)]
*  they are very focused on having rates be lower. You've seen the comments about easing short-term [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=346.28000000000003s)]
*  rates, but that's not the critical function. They need to see the 10-year rate get down below [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=351.64000000000004s)]
*  below 4% ultimately at some point just to be more stimulative to the market. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=356.59999999999997s)]
*  I do think that with rates at the 10-year 450, you could see a backup a little bit higher. But at [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=360.84s)]
*  that point with inflation running 2% to 2.5%, real rates will start to look attractive. I don't think [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=365.88s)]
*  we'll go much higher. So I don't think it's concerned. It's really a concern if you saw [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=370.68s)]
*  a major push higher to 5.5%, 6% type yields. That would be very restrictive on growth and on [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=374.68s)]
*  access to credit for both businesses and individuals if we got up to those types of levels. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=381.08s)]
*  Just a quick word, Geoff, on Apple. They're being threatened with a 25% [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=385.64s)]
*  tariff unless they relocate manufacturing from China back to the United States. Tim Cook was [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=389.64s)]
*  looking at India. It doesn't seem to be satisfactory for the president. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=394.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's a little concerning when they're going after individual companies. I mean, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=399.88s)]
*  you've seen that. I mean, I think that's how President Trump likes to negotiate. He likes [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=404.36s)]
*  to be very direct. I think at the end of the day, it's a messaging for businesses in general to [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=407.71999999999997s)]
*  move their production back. The benefits of at least lower rates and better treatment if [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=414.84000000000003s)]
*  you move to the US, I think, is what the main message is in President Trump's tweet. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=419.56s)]
*  We'll see how those negotiations work. I mean, he's typically had a very good relationship [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=424.12s)]
*  with Tim Cook, with the other high tech leaders of these businesses. So again, I view it as a [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=428.6s)]
*  threat, but it's something just to watch and it's the messaging to see how this happens. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=435.40000000000003s)]
*  You've seen the reaction in the Apple stock because both if it's true, it will have a dent. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=438.92s)]
*  But I think that this will again be part of the negotiation to figure out what's a suitable way [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=442.36s)]
*  for Apple to do the production and still be able to produce iPhones for the US consumers. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=446.92s)]
*  Geoff Grilles, good to chat. Thank you very much for coming on. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=451.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgfAMKPfjbA&t=454.68s)]
