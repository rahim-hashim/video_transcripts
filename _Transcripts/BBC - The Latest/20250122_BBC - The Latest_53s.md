**BBC - The Latest:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egy-FeQIHVg)
*  By the way, again, we won the young vote. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egy-FeQIHVg&t=0.0s)]
*  I think I won it through TikTok. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egy-FeQIHVg&t=2.4s)]
*  So I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egy-FeQIHVg&t=4.2s)]
*  Okay? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egy-FeQIHVg&t=7.7s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egy-FeQIHVg&t=8.700000000000001s)]
*  Are you open to Elon buying TikTok? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egy-FeQIHVg&t=9.700000000000001s)]
*  I would be if he wanted to buy it, yeah. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egy-FeQIHVg&t=11.1s)]
*  And on your inauguration? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egy-FeQIHVg&t=12.8s)]
*  I'd like her to buy it too. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egy-FeQIHVg&t=14.6s)]
*  I have the right to make a deal. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egy-FeQIHVg&t=16.9s)]
*  And I've met with owners of TikTok, the big owners. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egy-FeQIHVg&t=19.1s)]
*  It's worthless if it doesn't get a permit. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egy-FeQIHVg&t=23.2s)]
*  It's not like, oh, you can take the U.S. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egy-FeQIHVg&t=26.3s)]
*  The whole thing is worthless. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egy-FeQIHVg&t=28.3s)]
*  With a permit, it's worth like a trillion dollars. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egy-FeQIHVg&t=30.599999999999998s)]
*  So what I'm thinking about saying to somebody is buy it [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egy-FeQIHVg&t=34.1s)]
*  and give half to the United States of America, half, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egy-FeQIHVg&t=38.2s)]
*  and we'll give you the permit. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egy-FeQIHVg&t=41.2s)]
*  And they'll have a great partner, the United States. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egy-FeQIHVg&t=42.6s)]
*  And they'll have something that's actually more valuable [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egy-FeQIHVg&t=45.7s)]
*  because they have the ultimate partner, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egy-FeQIHVg&t=47.9s)]
*  and the United States will make it very worthwhile for them. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egy-FeQIHVg&t=50.2s)]
