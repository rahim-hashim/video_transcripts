# South Korea election takes place under shadow of martial law | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srXnYeqUrqA)
*  To South Korea, where they head to the polls on Tuesday to cast their vote for their new leader. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srXnYeqUrqA&t=0.0s)]
*  Six months to the day that the former president tried and failed to stage a military coup before [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srXnYeqUrqA&t=4.48s)]
*  being impeached. The vote promises to end months of political chaos which have paralysed the country. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srXnYeqUrqA&t=10.32s)]
*  But tensions have really ratcheted up. The disgraced president's party now led by former [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srXnYeqUrqA&t=16.32s)]
*  Labour Minister Kim Moon-soo is in disarray, giving the opposition candidate Lee Jae-myeong [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srXnYeqUrqA&t=21.76s)]
*  a big lead in the polls. With more from Seoul, here's Gene McKenzie. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srXnYeqUrqA&t=26.96s)]
*  This is high-risk campaigning. The opposition candidate will only address crowds from behind [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srXnYeqUrqA&t=34.4s)]
*  bulletproof glass. This presidential-level security is because of death threats he's [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srXnYeqUrqA&t=40.96s)]
*  been getting. There's even been a plot to assassinate him. This is not South Korean politics [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srXnYeqUrqA&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  as usual. This campaign has been transformed by this stunning event here last winter where [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srXnYeqUrqA&t=53.28s)]
*  the president tried to orchestrate a military takeover and as part of this he reportedly tried [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srXnYeqUrqA&t=59.6s)]
*  to have this candidate, the leader of the opposition, arrested. And the security here today gives you a [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srXnYeqUrqA&t=64.4s)]
*  sense of how violent and how polarized politics here in South Korea have become since. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srXnYeqUrqA&t=69.36s)]
*  South Koreans hope this election will heal these fractures and steer the country back onto more [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srXnYeqUrqA&t=76.88s)]
*  stable ground. That's an easy sell for this candidate and clear front-runner Lee Jae-myeong, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srXnYeqUrqA&t=83.04s)]
*  who famously scaled parliament's walls to vote down martial law. Now he claims he's the only one [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srXnYeqUrqA&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  who can ensure this never happens again. I didn't used to care about politics but since martial law [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srXnYeqUrqA&t=97.68s)]
*  I now trust and depend on Mr. Lee. I believe Mr. Lee is the only candidate who can end the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srXnYeqUrqA&t=106.24s)]
*  martial law insurrection. He is the man who orchestrated the military takeover, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srXnYeqUrqA&t=112.96s)]
*  now impeached and on trial. His self-defeating coup has tainted the ruling party, which is in [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srXnYeqUrqA&t=119.52s)]
*  disarray. They struggled to even choose a candidate, eventually landing on this man, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srXnYeqUrqA&t=126.32s)]
*  the president's former labor minister, who's fiercely defended him. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srXnYeqUrqA&t=132.4s)]
*  This has effectively turned this election into a referendum on martial law. It is a martial law [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srXnYeqUrqA&t=138.16s)]
*  election. You can see that the regime change sentiment is very, very high and it wasn't like [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srXnYeqUrqA&t=144.4s)]
*  that before. The conservatives are really struggling to get their party together. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srXnYeqUrqA&t=149.36s)]
*  Koreans are almost as tribal about baseball as they are about politics. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srXnYeqUrqA&t=156.88s)]
*  But at tonight's game the teams are united, desperate for the country to move forward [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srXnYeqUrqA&t=162.4s)]
*  so it can deal with its problems put on hold. Like negotiating with Donald Trump [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srXnYeqUrqA&t=168.4s)]
*  and growing its economy, which has taken a hit. But it's Tuesday's vote itself that matters more [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srXnYeqUrqA&t=175.52s)]
*  than anything. I hope our country has the power to save our democracy to be greater than before. So [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srXnYeqUrqA&t=182.08s)]
*  my voting will be a piece of power. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srXnYeqUrqA&t=189.12s)]
*  They came so close to having their democracy dismantled. They need this election to restore [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srXnYeqUrqA&t=194.8s)]
*  their faith, which has been so badly shaken. Ji Mackenzie, BBC News, Seoul. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srXnYeqUrqA&t=200.4s)]
