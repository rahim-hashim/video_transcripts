Video Description: Nicholas Prosper, 19, has been sentenced to a minimum of 49 years in prison for murdering his mother, brother and sister in Luton, UK, last year.

The bodies of Juliana Falcon, 48, Kyle Prosper, 16, and Giselle Prosper, 13, were found at their home in September.

After killing his family, Prosper planned to carry out a mass shooting at his former primary school - having chosen a Friday 13th date deliberately. 

Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb said Prosper "intended to unleash disaster on the community of Luton" and was "inappropriately cheerful" after being arrested. 

The court heard Prosper hoped to kill his family while they slept - but after a noisy struggle, he left the flat and neighbours called police.

*  more and a warning this report does contain some distressing detail. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=26.04s)]
*  Nicholas Prosper wanted to be the most notorious school shooter in the UK, but this is the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=30.04s)]
*  moment that plan is disrupted. At this point he's already murdered his family and these [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=41.64s)]
*  officers at the end of a night shift happen to see him on the street. Their instinct tells [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=49.92s)]
*  them something's not right. They see blood on his face and a shotgun and cartridges are [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=55.04s)]
*  found nearby. Prosper seen here leaving the flats where he lives has just used that shotgun [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=60.72s)]
*  to shoot his mother, Juliana Falcon, his 13-year-old sister Giselle and his 16-year-old brother [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=76.88s)]
*  Kyle. Kyle, who it is believed tried to stop his brother, was also stabbed more than 100 times. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=83.2s)]
*  Prosper then heads in the direction of his former primary school. One of the officers who wishes to [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=89.52000000000001s)]
*  remain anonymous for operational reasons says he now realises just how significant that arrest was. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=98.04s)]
*  It was very overwhelming knowing that it was me and my crewmate that managed to prevent this [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=104.28s)]
*  from happening. People may think it's a bit of luck, but at the end of the day I'm sure my team, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=110.08s)]
*  they would have had the exact same instincts. Sadly he was targeting early years, so potentially [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=116.4s)]
*  four-year-old children where he intended to shoot children as well as teachers before finishing [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=124.32s)]
*  with himself. Prosper's internet browsing took him to dark areas of the web. He researched crimes [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=132.28s)]
*  with mass casualties and school massacres such as Columbine and Sandy Hook. But in reality he was [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=139.12s)]
*  plotting. Seen here with a plank of wood, he mimics using a shotgun. But months later he bought the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=147.12s)]
*  real thing. He created a fake firearms licence and duped a legitimate gun holder into selling him a [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=154.48s)]
*  shotgun. The asking price was £450. Prosper paid £600. In the lift to his family flat he stands next [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=161.04s)]
*  to a delivery man casually carrying the deadly weapon and to practice handling the gun he used [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  a teddy bear. For those living near the Prosper's there is still disbelief at what happened here. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=177.12s)]
*  He had troubled many neighbours who say life here will never be the same again. Even that day when [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  it was happening and I was hearing everything, even the slightest part of me did not think a son [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=190.4s)]
*  is killing his mother, a brother is killing his sibling. I don't know what to say. Prosper was a [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=198.08s)]
*  loner intent on causing harm to many. A teenager who has shown no remorse for ruthlessly killing [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=208.96s)]
*  three members of his own family. Joe Black, it defies words, doesn't it? Let's speak to our colleague [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=217.28s)]
*  Martin Croxall who is outside Luton Crown Court. It is worth underlining, Martin, that this was a [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=224.8s)]
*  credible plan. He had the right number of cartridges, he had cased the school, he knew exactly what he was [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=231.04s)]
*  going to do. Yes, and over the course of the last couple of days, Christian, this court here in Luton [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=237.44s)]
*  has heard a lot of the detail about how he had spent more than a year planning these offences. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=244.56s)]
*  It was really thanks to a phone call by a neighbour in the block of flats who heard what sounded like [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=251.92000000000002s)]
*  a gunshot and a lot of noise disturbance when Nicholas Prosper had killed his mother, brother [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=257.92s)]
*  and sister that alerted the police. Two hours later, after they had died, two officers who were [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=264.08s)]
*  just finishing their night shift saw him walking along the road here in Luton, saw him put his hand [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=271.2s)]
*  up in the air in a strange way and stopped him and arrested him and later discovered that he had planned [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=277.76s)]
*  to go to St Joseph's Catholic Primary School to carry out that shooting because he wanted to achieve [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=284.4s)]
*  global notoriety and thankfully they stopped that happening. They also found the shotgun and those [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=290.15999999999997s)]
*  cartridges in a bush in a bag nearby and the judge here, Mrs Justice Chi McGrub, as part of her [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=298.0s)]
*  sentencing remarks said it's the deaths of Juliana, Kyle and Giselle that have saved the lives of many [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=304.0s)]
*  children and the community here owes them a debt of gratitude but the judge was quite clear that [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=310.96s)]
*  the plan he had put together was cogent, calculating and selfish and in sentencing him to 49 years, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=317.52s)]
*  she also said that he remains so dangerous and may never actually be released. After the hearing [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=328.0s)]
*  ended here at Luton Crown Court, we heard from the senior investigating officer from the major crime [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=335.52s)]
*  unit here, DCI Sam Karner, who talked about the seriousness of Prosper's crimes. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=341.84s)]
*  My entire policing career, which has included many years spent on the major crime team, I've never [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=349.04s)]
*  encountered anyone capable of such horrific acts while showing no remorse and I'm pleased that this [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=355.44s)]
*  truly evil individual will serve a significant proportion of his life behind bars. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=363.36s)]
*  Well the police and crime commissioner for Bedfordshire, John Tizard, has now written to [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=372.56s)]
*  the Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, to request an urgent review of firearms licensing following [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=377.68s)]
*  the ease with which Nicholas Prosper managed to buy this shotgun with which he killed his mother [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=384.56s)]
*  and two siblings using a fake gun license certificate. Mr Tizard has said to Yvette Cooper [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=391.76s)]
*  that there should be a review of legislation and he's suggested a change to the current law [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=400.08s)]
*  which would give vendors seven days to notify police of any sale or exchange so checks could [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=405.2s)]
*  be carried out. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v54AALzTm9E&t=412.88s)]
