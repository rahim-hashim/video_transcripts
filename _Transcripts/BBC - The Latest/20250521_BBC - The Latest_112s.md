Video Description: US President Donald Trump has unveiled plans for a "Golden Dome" missile defence system.
 
A design has been selected for the futuristic system, which will be operational by the end of his time in office, Trump said.
 
Just days after returning to the White House in January, Trump unveiled his intentions for the system, aimed at countering "next-generation" aerial threats to the US, including ballistic and cruise missiles.
 
An initial sum of $25bn (£18.7bn) has been earmarked in a new budget bill - although the government has estimated it could end up costing 20 times that over decades.
 
But there are also doubts about whether the US will be able to deliver a comprehensive defence system for such a huge land mass.

**BBC - The Latest:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsyPSyCzKA)
*  US President Donald Trump has unveiled the design for a new missile defense system for [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsyPSyCzKA&t=0.0s)]
*  the United States that he's calling the Golden Dome. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsyPSyCzKA&t=4.98s)]
*  He said it would be able to intercept attacks launched from space and claimed it would be [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsyPSyCzKA&t=8.64s)]
*  up and running before he leaves office in 2029. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsyPSyCzKA&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  The president said the final cost of the project would be $175 billion. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsyPSyCzKA&t=16.2s)]
*  Our North American correspondent Peter Vose told me more about the proposal. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsyPSyCzKA&t=21.68s)]
*  This is Donald Trump's plan to essentially future-proof the United States from potential [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsyPSyCzKA&t=25.78s)]
*  attacks from its adversaries. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsyPSyCzKA&t=31.42s)]
*  It is looking ahead, it is looking at the potential developments in terms of missile [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsyPSyCzKA&t=33.94s)]
*  technology and the way that the United States could be attacked from targets that are pointed [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsyPSyCzKA&t=39.18s)]
*  out from the Earth and from space. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsyPSyCzKA&t=47.66s)]
*  And that's the significant difference. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsyPSyCzKA&t=51.38s)]
*  The United States may be traditional in a certain sense, but the way in which the adversaries [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsyPSyCzKA&t=54.34s)]
*  will use technology with weapons that are essentially fired from space is going to be [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsyPSyCzKA&t=59.18s)]
*  the future. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsyPSyCzKA&t=65.64s)]
*  And you'll get many defense experts who say that this is how Donald Trump and other world [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsyPSyCzKA&t=66.64s)]
*  leaders should be looking at defense for the future. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsyPSyCzKA&t=71.1s)]
*  The big question is, is Donald Trump being overly ambitious? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsyPSyCzKA&t=73.9s)]
*  This seems to be molded on Israel's Iron Dome, which of course is designed and has [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsyPSyCzKA&t=78.7s)]
*  been used for some time now to prevent short-range attacks in a relatively small country. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsyPSyCzKA&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  The United States is of course very different. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsyPSyCzKA&t=90.88s)]
*  This is a vast expanse of land, at least mainland America, and the technology required, especially [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsyPSyCzKA&t=93.02000000000001s)]
*  to get the hardware into space, is going to be tremendously sophisticated. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsyPSyCzKA&t=99.34s)]
*  And some critics say that President Trump won't be able to achieve it in the three-and-a-half [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsyPSyCzKA&t=104.44s)]
*  years that he's spelled out. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvsyPSyCzKA&t=109.2s)]
