**BBC - The Latest:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37hGH2oZXr8)
*  What's the most outrageous thing that you've seen in real life that you think could be a good story for white notice? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37hGH2oZXr8&t=0.0s)]
*  I was standing in line one time, I was traveling and I was flying first and you know there's a line for that [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37hGH2oZXr8&t=7.04s)]
*  and this white man just came and stood in front of me. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37hGH2oZXr8&t=12.52s)]
*  I like tapped him and I was just like, I'm in line, he's like, oh yeah but this is first class. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37hGH2oZXr8&t=15.92s)]
*  And I was like, I know. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37hGH2oZXr8&t=20.2s)]
*  And it's like moments like that and he was just like so, and he was like upset that he had to move [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37hGH2oZXr8&t=22.2s)]
*  and then was even waiting for me to scan my ticket to see if I was lying. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37hGH2oZXr8&t=27.279999999999998s)]
*  And he sat behind me on the plane which was very like karmic and I was just like, I was like yeah I'm here. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37hGH2oZXr8&t=31.279999999999998s)]
*  Oh, goodness me. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37hGH2oZXr8&t=36.28s)]
*  It's bonkers. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37hGH2oZXr8&t=37.28s)]
*  It's all centering around like entitlement. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37hGH2oZXr8&t=38.28s)]
*  I think that's, I can't really wrap my head around that and perhaps it's my cultural lens of not feeling entitled to very much. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37hGH2oZXr8&t=41.28s)]
*  And so when I see someone sort of like not just take up space that they need to but other people's space as well. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37hGH2oZXr8&t=48.28s)]
