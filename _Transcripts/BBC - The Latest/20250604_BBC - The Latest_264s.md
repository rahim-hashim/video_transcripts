Video Description: US President Trump has signed a ban on travel to the US from 12 countries, including Afghanistan, Haiti and Iran.
There are an additional seven countries whose nationals face partial travel restrictions, including Cuba and Venezuela.
The White House said these "common sense restrictions" would "protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors".
When announcing the ban on social media platform Truth Social, Trump cited the Colorado attack on Sunday.
The proclamation echoes an order from Trump's first term in 2017, when he announced a ban on travel from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the US.

**BBC - The Latest:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LZhGj1aI)
*  We begin in the U.S. where President Donald Trump has signed a travel ban to stop people from 12 [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LZhGj1aI&t=0.0s)]
*  countries from entering the United States. The proclamation, which is similar to an executive [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LZhGj1aI&t=5.76s)]
*  order, also partially restricts people from seven other nations, including some in Asia. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LZhGj1aI&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  The 12 countries affected are Afghanistan, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LZhGj1aI&t=17.2s)]
*  Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. He also said he was partially [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LZhGj1aI&t=23.04s)]
*  restricting and limiting the entry into the U.S. of nationals from an additional seven countries. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LZhGj1aI&t=31.68s)]
*  They are Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LZhGj1aI&t=37.68s)]
*  President Trump spoke about some of his reasoning behind the move. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LZhGj1aI&t=45.92s)]
*  The recent terror attack in Boulder, Colorado, has underscored the extreme dangers posed to [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LZhGj1aI&t=50.0s)]
*  our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted, as well as those [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LZhGj1aI&t=55.76s)]
*  who come here as temporary visitors and overstay their visas. We don't want them. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LZhGj1aI&t=62.0s)]
*  Our North America correspondent, Jake Kwan, has the latest from Washington. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LZhGj1aI&t=69.2s)]
*  President Trump said this proclamation will go into effect next week, on Monday. So, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LZhGj1aI&t=73.6s)]
*  if you do not already have a visa, if you do not already have a refugee status, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LZhGj1aI&t=79.12s)]
*  you will be restricted from entering the country. And President Trump promised that this measure [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LZhGj1aI&t=83.28s)]
*  will protect Americans from future terrorist attacks or any kind of threat on American lives. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LZhGj1aI&t=89.28s)]
*  And he actually pointed out the Colorado attack, where a man who was staying in America, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LZhGj1aI&t=95.76s)]
*  according to the White House, illegally had thrown a malt of cocktail at a group of protesters, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LZhGj1aI&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  as one of the reasons to introduce this kind of travel ban. However, there is no explanation [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LZhGj1aI&t=107.84s)]
*  of the fact that Egypt, where this suspect of the Colorado bombing is from, Egypt was not included [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LZhGj1aI&t=114.88000000000001s)]
*  in this list of countries. So there is some inconsistency there, as well as there is the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LZhGj1aI&t=122.88000000000001s)]
*  question of how long can this proclamation stay. In the first time he did this in 2017, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LZhGj1aI&t=128.96s)]
*  the proclamation of travel ban, which he dubbed Muslim ban, which slapped against majority Muslim [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LZhGj1aI&t=136.88s)]
*  countries, was bogged down in the American court system, facing multiple challenges in different [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LZhGj1aI&t=142.72s)]
*  courts across America, and that it had to be amended multiple times before it was eventually [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LZhGj1aI&t=149.44s)]
*  held up by the Supreme Court. So it faced a lot of challenges the first time, and it is expected to [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LZhGj1aI&t=154.32s)]
*  face similar challenges the second time, including political and legal. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LZhGj1aI&t=159.92s)]
*  Jake, I'm really glad you mentioned the last time Trump did this in his first administration, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LZhGj1aI&t=167.84s)]
*  because that caused a lot of people for, a lot of problems rather, for people, perhaps people [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LZhGj1aI&t=172.56s)]
*  who were Iranian originally, who were, who still had the passport, but living in America. I mean, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LZhGj1aI&t=178.56s)]
*  what's the response likely to be to this latest travel ban? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LZhGj1aI&t=184.56s)]
*  In a way, some describe this proclamation as a more savvier, more strategic version of his first [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LZhGj1aI&t=188.4s)]
*  term's Muslim ban. I mean, this proclamation was not a surprise. One of his day one executive [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LZhGj1aI&t=195.36s)]
*  order actually asked a review of different countries around the world that has consistently high [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LZhGj1aI&t=201.44000000000003s)]
*  number of people overstaying their visa, or maybe pose a threat to America by having a big terrorist [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LZhGj1aI&t=207.28s)]
*  presence, as well as looking at countries that does not have a central government that is strong [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LZhGj1aI&t=213.52s)]
*  enough to vet the people's identity that is traveling to America. So the first time that this [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LZhGj1aI&t=219.52s)]
*  travel ban was introduced, the reason it was defeated in the courts was that it seemed to [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LZhGj1aI&t=226.88000000000002s)]
*  discriminate against a certain religion, which is the Islam. This time, this proclamation does not [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LZhGj1aI&t=232.32000000000002s)]
*  include such language. So it is expected to fare better in the court system. It seems that President [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LZhGj1aI&t=238.16000000000003s)]
*  Trump and the White House had learned the lesson from the first time. Another difference from the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LZhGj1aI&t=243.76000000000002s)]
*  first proclamation is that that one was supposed to last maybe 60 days or 90 days. This time, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LZhGj1aI&t=247.84s)]
*  it does not have an end date. They say that after a certain period, there will be a review [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LZhGj1aI&t=254.0s)]
*  of whether they should stay or not. But for now, this is expected to stay indefinitely. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd5LZhGj1aI&t=258.4s)]
