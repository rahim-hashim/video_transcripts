**BBC - The Latest:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8)
*  As a fan before becoming professional, it's something that I always watched these tournaments growing up and like [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=0.0s)]
*  Always had the dream of even just playing a major is is a great accomplishment [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  But to be able to win one is the is the pinnacle [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=9.84s)]
*  It's something that a player always wants to do and or really wants to win. It's a dream [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=12.32s)]
*  I'm William Merriman also known as uh mezzy and I play for team vitality counter-strike team [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=21.28s)]
*  You've had a very busy weekend. Can you just tell us why just finished up at the blast major which was in Austin, which is [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=26.0s)]
*  Like seen as our grand slam of eSports in in my game [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=33.92s)]
*  I play so it's been a busy weekend where we managed to be successful and win the the major which is a [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=37.32s)]
*  Big accomplishment. I would say as a team. It doesn't happen so often when you have two a year. So it's uh, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=44.4s)]
*  It's rare that you get the chance to win one [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=50.64s)]
*  You're also setting records you're the first person from the uk to ever win a major [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=53.04s)]
*  Was that in the back of your head before you went into this final? I think especially there's there's been so much support [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=59.32s)]
*  myself over social media and so many messages from other uk players or just uk fans overall [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=65.24s)]
*  So I think going into the final and going into this tournament as always that in that's always in the back of my mind [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=71.0s)]
*  And you always want to make everyone at home proud as well [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=76.64s)]
*  So it was something definitely a goal of mine going into the tournament and going to the final where I really wanted to be a uk [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=79.64s)]
*  Player that could bring this home. And yeah, I'm just I'm very happy that I was able to do it before we jump into it [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=86.36s)]
*  Because I want to get your reaction to some moments from from from the final [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=92.36s)]
*  For anyone who hasn't watched it before. Can you just in a sentence or two explain what counter-strike is counter-strike? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=97.4s)]
*  I would say out of many games is pretty is one of the easy ones to understand [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  It's it's very simple. It's five e five attack versus defense pretty much and the goal is for the attacker [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=108.44s)]
*  to win the round whether it's to [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=115.39999999999999s)]
*  Eliminate all opponents or to to plant the the objective and the the defense is to stop that [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=117.56s)]
*  Um, so it's very simple in the sense that it's five e five [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=123.64s)]
*  Yeah, and there's an objective to attack and to defend and uh, yeah [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=126.28s)]
*  It's first to 13 rounds and if it's not quite finished [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=129.96s)]
*  But that point it goes to 12 time overtime and then goes from there [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=133.48s)]
*  So it's uh, usually best of one best of three [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=136.6s)]
*  Um and in some other taunts throughout the year we played some best of five finals [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=139.64s)]
*  Which is played on various different maps as well. What makes a major so important? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=143.0s)]
*  You said there were two a year if you were going to you know compare it to other sports [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=147.72s)]
*  How would you kind of where would you rank it? I would say it's [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=152.44s)]
*  It's a bit more comparable or a bit easier to compare to say tennis or the grand slams. Um [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=155.39999999999998s)]
*  Where yeah, like so there's only two a year and uh [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=160.76s)]
*  Everyone within the e-sports team in account strike is is trying to peak and trying to [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=164.35999999999999s)]
*  Perform at their best towards these tournaments. I think every other tournament throughout the year [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=169.95999999999998s)]
*  We've had a very successful year, but I think the lead of this one is the one that as a player [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=174.6s)]
*  And as a team you always want to win [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=179.72s)]
*  As a fan before becoming professional. It's something that I always watched these tournaments [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=182.35999999999999s)]
*  Um growing up and like always had the dream of even just playing a major is is a great accomplishment [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=186.67999999999998s)]
*  But to be able to win one is the is the pinnacle [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=193.07999999999998s)]
*  It's something that a player always wants to do and or really wants to win [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=195.48s)]
*  It's a it's a dream of mine and uh for many players [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=198.2s)]
*  So yeah [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=200.76s)]
*  When there's only two a year and there's so much pressure and there's such high stakes going to a tournament that it's it makes it [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=201.32s)]
*  That very much more special than compared to any other tournament throughout the year as well as we found [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  When did you watch your first major? So my first major I watched would probably been [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=211.64s)]
*  Uh the very start of 2014 [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=216.2s)]
*  um [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=218.35999999999999s)]
*  so I I watched previous versions of counter-strike when it was uh, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=219.39999999999998s)]
*  Previously known as counter-strike source because my dad played it [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=223.48s)]
*  but when I first really got into more of like [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=226.92s)]
*  Seeing it more of it as a dream or uh really getting into it as a view when I got a bit older with [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=230.28s)]
*  around 2014 is when I probably first my first major and uh [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=234.51999999999998s)]
*  And yeah, it was just it was so exciting just to see all these players [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=238.76s)]
*  Uh battle it out and and just see how high stakes it is and the pressure and everything going involved into this tournament. It's uh, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=241.88s)]
*  It's it's one of the ones that just makes you really excited to watch whether it's in traditional sports when the world cup comes up [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=249.0s)]
*  Or like say the grand slam to tennis. It's it's the one tournament if you miss all the others [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=254.6s)]
*  It's it's this is the one you really want to to watch [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=258.28s)]
*  I hope you don't mind if it means that you'll kind of reveal how old you are [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=261.15999999999997s)]
*  But in 2014 watching as a fan, how old would you have been and how is it? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=264.28s)]
*  You know different now being grown up being a player on that big stage in 2014. I was I was around 16ish [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=268.84000000000003s)]
*  So around then I was still yeah going through high school and and now [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=276.92s)]
*  A bit older and just having the chance to play at these tournaments. It's uh, it's a huge honor. I think uh, like say it would [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=281.32000000000005s)]
*  Went up back then when I was watching it was just a dream just to even have the chance to maybe even play [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=287.8s)]
*  professional one day in this game, but to be able to perform and play at these majors and [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=293.06s)]
*  Like say get a chance to win one as well [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=298.2s)]
*  It's it's it's a dream come true because like say when you when you're watching back then when I was a bit younger [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=300.44s)]
*  You never you never quite know what's going to happen. And yeah, it was just a dream back then and now it's it's it's a reality [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=305.32s)]
*  And it's I don't think it's quite something as well. Yeah in terms of how you got into professional esports [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=311.08s)]
*  Um, how do you feel it compares now in terms of the opportunities for new people to get in to start training? I would say [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=316.84000000000003s)]
*  Uh now in the recent years it's become much more a bit easier for players [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=323.88s)]
*  Um, I think it's it's more known for the for the public. I think even now within the uk it's it's still growing [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=329.64s)]
*  Um, I think there's still a lot of people shocked when they say what I do is my professional job and and so on [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=336.52s)]
*  But I think I think it's still growing within the uk [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=342.12s)]
*  But there's definitely more opportunities because it has grown so much since since when I started playing it was uh, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=344.59999999999997s)]
*  It was it was pretty hard to to get anywhere within the uk and now it's growing it's still [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=350.20000000000005s)]
*  It still needs some more [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=355.64000000000004s)]
*  I'll say a bit more investment within the uk and and so on because I think there's still some players that there's definitely talent out there [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=356.76000000000005s)]
*  Um, but I would say there's not enough players to make teams and so on and it's still growing within the uk [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=363.88000000000005s)]
*  but I think for the wider audience within europe within worldwide, it's uh, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=369.24s)]
*  It's it's we're kind of in our own bubble [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=373.64000000000004s)]
*  But once you're in the bubble, it feels like esports is huge and counter-strike is huge [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=375.32s)]
*  It's just not so known to a lot of other people outside the industry and yeah [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=379.0s)]
*  I I think year on year it's it's growing so much and I hope within the uk it grows more and [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=383.0s)]
*  We can see more players and more talent out there can kind of put their put their put the show out as well [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=388.52s)]
*  Because I think there there's so much talent out there. It just needs a bit more time to to be shown as well [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=393.96s)]
*  You are now a trailblazer [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=399.4s)]
*  You will whether you like it or not be an inspiration to a lot of people being the first person from the uk to win [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=401.88s)]
*  a counter-strike major [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=407.79999999999995s)]
*  How do you feel about having that responsibility? It's definitely weird. I think um [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=409.64s)]
*  for a few years now, i've been a player that's uh [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=414.76s)]
*  Been towards the top of counter-strike or in a couple years now with team vitality been able to kind of show [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=418.84s)]
*  my skill as well on this level and it feels great to be able to [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=425.96s)]
*  Just just to be out there for uh for other uk players for whether it's in counter-strike room even other esports just to [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=429.88s)]
*  Kind of help motivate them even more and push themselves further because like I say, I think [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=436.36s)]
*  Throughout my career i've i've always tried to be as open as possible and try and keep [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=440.92s)]
*  Any messages open for any uk players or if they ever need advice or any help in anything? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=445.96s)]
*  I try and respond as much as I can and I think that's the main thing for me is that [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=450.6s)]
*  I just want to be someone that can try and help with the uk players just uh [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=455.24s)]
*  Yeah improve and hopefully motivate them even more to just keep putting as much time as they can into [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=459.32s)]
*  counter-strike or other esports and yeah, and how and how the scene grew up and that's the main thing that's a big goal for me [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=464.84s)]
*  just try and [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=470.76s)]
*  help the uk grow within the sports and within counter-strike and just try and see more players and more teams at the highest level because [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=471.96s)]
*  uh, I don't know it'll be amazing and [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=477.32s)]
*  hopefully, uh not take the the [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=479.96s)]
*  The crown off me just yet. Maybe after i retire or something [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=482.84s)]
*  But I think it would be great to have more uk players, uh coming through the scene that moment when you're walking out in the arena [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=485.56s)]
*  with your teammates [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=492.92s)]
*  Just describe what it's like what's going on in your head these entrances especially for us as team vitality. I think um, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=494.44s)]
*  so our in-game leader apex is definitely seen as more of the villain within uh, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=500.76s)]
*  In the us, I think it's definitely much a fun a fun crowd to play in front of uh, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=506.36s)]
*  There was a lot of booing which throughout all our games on the stage in front of the arena [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=511.24s)]
*  There was a lot of booze which I think as a team we we really love it [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=515.5600000000001s)]
*  It's so it's so fun to have that that crowd against you and try and prove them wrong and go up against them [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=519.16s)]
*  And yeah, just going on to that stage in that arena. It was it's something really special to [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=524.52s)]
*  Walk in front of all the fans and just uh, like say even if we received uh with loads of booze [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=530.12s)]
*  It's it's also fine and uses motivation to push ourselves even further and get the win and yeah [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=535.48s)]
*  Just there's nothing really I can compare to being able to go on that stage and all the adrenaline [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=540.4399999999999s)]
*  And just all the work we've done all year to prepare for us this at this moment. It all comes down to that [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=545.88s)]
*  We've got to ask you about the moment when you lifted the trophy. It's it's really crazy [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=551.48s)]
*  I think so for a couple of us so me and flamesy on the roster [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=555.88s)]
*  It's our first uh, our first major wins for a few of the guys [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=559.0799999999999s)]
*  It's their second and apex who's been around for a lot longer. It's his third [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=562.52s)]
*  So I think for us it was it's very surreal moment. Uh, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=565.88s)]
*  just to [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=570.1999999999999s)]
*  Just realize after we won that we lost the first map and just to bounce back and win the second two [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=571.4s)]
*  It was a great thing to close it out [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=575.64s)]
*  And like say it was so much sacrifice and hard work throughout the year to to come down to now and then yeah [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=577.8s)]
*  Go up and lift that trophy. It's as well. It was one of the I think it was probably one of the heaviest trophies. I think [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=582.8399999999999s)]
*  At least in counter-strike history [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=588.92s)]
*  I think they they definitely made a point there with how big the trophy was and to come down to this moment just for [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=590.28s)]
*  A few of us guys that hadn't won one before to be able to lift it together. It was uh, yeah, it was it's a it's a [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=595.64s)]
*  It's a moment. I'll always uh cherish and always remember because it's you never know when the next final or the next major final [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=602.1999999999999s)]
*  You're going to be playing in and yeah just to be able to do that now [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=608.76s)]
*  Um after the season we've had and to go into the off season [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=612.12s)]
*  It was the the best way we could finish this part but even mentioned yet that there was a prize pot of half a million dollars [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=615.0s)]
*  Uh when there's so much money on the line [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=620.92s)]
*  Does that ever play into your thinking or is it really just going for the trophy going for the win? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=623.72s)]
*  I think for us as players, it's it's definitely much [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=627.8s)]
*  it's more much more about the the win and [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=631.08s)]
*  It's not something we focus too much on is is the prize me? Of course. It's uh, it's it's it's a great [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=633.88s)]
*  Add on a great benefit as well, but I think [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=638.84s)]
*  For us as players and even before becoming professional. It's our our focus is just for is playing because we love the game and love the competition [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=641.88s)]
*  I think [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=649.8s)]
*  Everyone within the team and within esports. It's uh, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=651.08s)]
*  It's such a great honor to be able to do to be able to play full time and to do this as our profession [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=654.92s)]
*  it's it's yeah, it's just playing for the love of the game and just having that competition and [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=659.64s)]
*  Like I said earlier going onto the stage and playing in front of the fans [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=665.32s)]
*  That's that's the most fun thing about about being able to play this game [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=668.2s)]
*  So of course the the prize pool is it's great [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=671.4s)]
*  But I think for us it's it's so much more focused on [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=673.88s)]
*  The competition and just playing the game that we love as well assuming you had a chance to celebrate while you're out in the states [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=676.6800000000001s)]
*  But you're back in the uk now now that you're back here. How are you going to celebrate? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=682.76s)]
*  I mean, I'll definitely see some family. Well, I I I became a dad late last year [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=685.8000000000001s)]
*  So it's definitely back straight back into dad duties as well. So it's um, but I think just being able to spend time with family we [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=690.36s)]
*  Within within counter strike. We spend so much time away from home. Uh constantly traveling to different events, uh, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=697.72s)]
*  Uh around the world [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=703.7199999999999s)]
*  so it's just nice now to come into the off season celebrate with family and uh, yeah just spend time with them because uh, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=704.92s)]
*  Yeah, like say in a few weeks time, we're gonna be back out traveling again [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=711.7199999999999s)]
*  So I just really like to spend time with family and just cherish these moments to be able to celebrate with them as well [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=715.24s)]
*  Congratulations. Um, do you mind if I then ask uh, you said that you um [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=720.9s)]
*  Got into counter strike because of your dad [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=725.88s)]
*  Uh, are you planning to pass on the love of counter strike again? I mean that's always the plan [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=728.04s)]
*  I mean, i'd never force anything on them [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=732.6s)]
*  But I think if if if she ever wanted to get into counter strike or e-sports, I think that would be great as well [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=735.16s)]
*  It's something that if I can ever pass on my passion as well. It's it's it would be great. But yeah [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=741.8s)]
*  The the option is always there [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umb_isH7eT8&t=747.56s)]
