Video Description: The UK has signed a £3.4bn ($4.6bn) deal to hand over sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, while retaining control of a UK-US military base on Diego Garcia - the largest of the islands.
 
Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the 99-year agreement to lease back Diego Garcia will cost the UK £101m a year, and is necessary to protect the base from "malign influence". 
 
Mauritian Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam said the agreement completed "the total process of decolonisation".
 
But UK opposition leaders - and some Chagossians now residing in the UK - have criticised the deal.

# What is the Chagos Islands deal between UK and Mauritius? | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94)
*  The Chagos Islands form an archipelago in the Indian Ocean. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=0.0s)]
*  They've been controlled by the UK for decades, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=3.84s)]
*  and they host a secretive US military base. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=7.0s)]
*  Now there's a new deal concerning the islands. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=10.44s)]
*  A last-minute challenge delayed it, but in the end, it was done. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=15.08s)]
*  The base is staying, but the UK is ceding sovereignty [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=18.64s)]
*  of the islands to Mauritius. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=21.8s)]
*  Its prime minister has called it a great victory [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=24.04s)]
*  for the Mauritian nation, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  and Sakir Starmer has made this case. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=27.48s)]
*  By agreeing to this deal now on our terms, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=30.36s)]
*  we're securing strong protections, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=33.92s)]
*  including from malign influence, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=36.56s)]
*  that will allow the base to operate well into the next century. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=39.08s)]
*  The Chagos Islands matter a great deal to the UK, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=43.2s)]
*  to the US, to Mauritius, and of course to Jogosians. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=46.96s)]
*  It's a complicated story, which reaches back years. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=50.8s)]
*  The islands are in the middle of the Indian Ocean, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=54.92s)]
*  1,600 kilometres from the nearest landmass. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=57.36s)]
*  They had been part of Mauritius when it was a British colony, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=60.36s)]
*  but that changed. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=63.48s)]
*  Before Mauritius gained independence in the late 1960s, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=64.92s)]
*  the United Kingdom withheld the Chagos Islands, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=68.92s)]
*  it detached them from the colony of Mauritius [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=72.16s)]
*  and held onto them. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=74.88s)]
*  It renamed them the British Indian Ocean Territory. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=76.0s)]
*  As part of this, in 1965, the UK paid Mauritius £3 million, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=79.44s)]
*  but Mauritius would later argue the agreement amounted to [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=84.2s)]
*  coercion and duress and that Britain, as the colonial power, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=87.2s)]
*  had unreasonable leverage. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=91.04s)]
*  And there are insights into how the British saw the islands [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=93.36s)]
*  and their people. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=96.16s)]
*  A Foreign Office memo from 1966 states the ambition [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=97.48s)]
*  to get some rocks which will remain ours, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=100.92s)]
*  adding there will be no indigenous population [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=103.6s)]
*  except seagulls. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=106.4s)]
*  In 1967, a year ahead of Mauritius becoming independent, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=108.32000000000001s)]
*  Britain began the forced removal of the population [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=112.0s)]
*  of the Chagos Islands. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=114.68s)]
*  Over a thousand people were sent to the Seychelles, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=116.32s)]
*  to Mauritius and later to the UK. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=118.63999999999999s)]
*  Human Rights Watchers call these expulsions [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=122.08s)]
*  a crime against humanity. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=124.27999999999999s)]
*  And one Chagossian, born in exile in Mauritius, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=126.36s)]
*  describes what happened this way. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=129.16s)]
*  Our people were sacrificed for Mauritius independence, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=131.68s)]
*  for this military base, for the defence purpose of the West. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=134.64s)]
*  What about us? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=139.68s)]
*  What do we gain in return? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=140.4s)]
*  A life in exile? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=142.16s)]
*  On multiple occasions, the UK has publicly [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=143.88s)]
*  expressed regret for the expulsions. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=145.92s)]
*  But documents leaked to The Guardian offer further insight. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=148.0s)]
*  Notes taken by a US official show that in 2009, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=151.88s)]
*  a senior UK Foreign Office official said, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=155.92s)]
*  we do not regret the removal of the population [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=158.72s)]
*  since removal was necessary for the British Indian Ocean [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=161.23999999999998s)]
*  Territory to fulfil its strategic purpose. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=164.11999999999998s)]
*  The British Indian Ocean Territory, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=167.64s)]
*  remember, was how the British had renamed the islands. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=169.11999999999998s)]
*  And that strategic purpose that was referenced there [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=172.48s)]
*  is primarily about one of the Chagoss Islands, Diego Garcia. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=175.56s)]
*  In 1966, Britain had leased the island to the US [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=180.68s)]
*  in order for a military base to be built. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=184.44s)]
*  The base would grow to accommodate up [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=187.8s)]
*  to 5,000 personnel. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=189.76s)]
*  And because of its shape, the Americans [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=192.08s)]
*  labelled it the footprint of freedom. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=193.84s)]
*  Though freedom doesn't extend to being allowed to visit, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=196.28s)]
*  it's one of the most secretive US military facilities [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=199.04s)]
*  in the world. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=202.08s)]
*  And this facility matters so much because of its location. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=203.51999999999998s)]
*  The nearest British military base [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=207.48s)]
*  is in Oman, over 3,500 kilometers away. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=208.92s)]
*  The nearest US base is in Bahrain, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=212.83999999999997s)]
*  nearly 5,000 kilometers away. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=215.16s)]
*  Diego Garcia gives both countries access [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=218.0s)]
*  to a base in a part of the world where [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=220.76s)]
*  they don't have another one. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=223.44s)]
*  If US or UK forces are operating in the area, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=224.92s)]
*  it's pretty much the only option that they [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=229.79999999999998s)]
*  have got for support. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=232.36s)]
*  It has both an airfield, naval facilities, a deep water [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=234.24s)]
*  harbor. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=240.28s)]
*  That's why the Chagoss Islands are so strategically important. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=241.04000000000002s)]
*  But the UK's actions on Diego Garcia in particular [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=244.96s)]
*  have come under sustained pressure for years. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=248.72000000000003s)]
*  In 2019, the UN's highest court, the International Court [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=252.36s)]
*  of Justice, called Britain's position unlawful. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=255.60000000000002s)]
*  At the hearings, the UK admitted that its expulsion [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=259.28000000000003s)]
*  and treatment of Chagossians was shameful and wrong. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=261.96s)]
*  And in the same year, the UN General Assembly [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=265.68s)]
*  voted overwhelmingly in favor of the UK seeding [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=267.84s)]
*  the sovereignty of the islands. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=271.32s)]
*  Mauritius wants to achieve the full decolonization [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=273.4s)]
*  of its sovereign territory. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=276.52s)]
*  And the rest of the world, most of it, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=278.32s)]
*  backs Mauritius in that demand. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=280.4s)]
*  In 2022, the UK decided to act. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=283.03999999999996s)]
*  Then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=286.35999999999996s)]
*  his government would start talks about seeding control [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=288.15999999999997s)]
*  of the islands. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=291.12s)]
*  With this new deal, the Labor government of Sakir Starmer [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=292.28000000000003s)]
*  has now completed that process. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=295.8s)]
*  As well as the UK seeding sovereignty of the islands [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=298.36s)]
*  to Mauritius, for Chagossians, a resettlement program [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=300.72s)]
*  to all islands except Diego Garcia will be allowed. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=303.96s)]
*  There will also be a fund for Chagossians who were expelled. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=308.04s)]
*  And there's one more crucial aspect to the deal. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=311.36s)]
*  The UK will take a 99-year lease over Diego Garcia. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=314.52s)]
*  That means the base stays. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=318.76s)]
*  The cost of this lease will be £101 million a year. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=320.96s)]
*  And the deal isn't without its critics. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=324.64s)]
*  We should not be paying to surrender British territory [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=327.08s)]
*  to Mauritius. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=331.03999999999996s)]
*  The fact that Labor's negotiating something [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=332.12s)]
*  that sees the British taxpayer in hawk [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=333.91999999999996s)]
*  for potential billions is completely wrong. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=336.15999999999997s)]
*  We've also heard concerns from some of those displaced [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=338.88s)]
*  in the 1960s, along with their descendants. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=341.32s)]
*  They say they haven't been properly consulted. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=344.4s)]
*  To this, the Foreign Office says the interests [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=347.4s)]
*  of the Chagossian community has been an important part [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=349.44s)]
*  of the negotiations. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=352.64s)]
*  But several Chagossians speaking to the BBC [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=353.76s)]
*  say that isn't the case. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=357.0s)]
*  Every time we made a request to be heard, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=359.0s)]
*  we have been excluded, was one allegation. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=361.03999999999996s)]
*  Also, the deal was temporarily halted by an injunction [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=364.0s)]
*  brought by Chagossian campaigners who want a right [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=366.91999999999996s)]
*  to return to live on the islands that includes Diego Garcia. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=369.52s)]
*  The rights we're asking for now, we've been fighting for [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=374.08s)]
*  for six years. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=376.44s)]
*  Mauritius is not gonna give that to us. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=378.08s)]
*  So we need to keep fighting with the British government [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=380.8s)]
*  to listen to us. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=384.08s)]
*  This is one perspective, others have welcomed the deal. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=385.32s)]
*  Chagossians do not speak with one voice [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=388.44s)]
*  on what should happen. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=391.0s)]
*  But for now, this deal is done. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=392.4s)]
*  And there's another country we need to talk about too, China. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=395.44s)]
*  It's a long way to the east of the islands, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=400.15999999999997s)]
*  but it's an ally and trading partner of Mauritius. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=402.12s)]
*  It's also a global rival to the US [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=404.91999999999996s)]
*  and just like the US, it's looking for opportunities [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=408.08s)]
*  to establish its military presence. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=411.04s)]
*  The UK argues this is another reason [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=413.56s)]
*  the deal needed to be completed. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=416.04s)]
*  If we did not agree this deal, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=418.56s)]
*  the legal situation would mean [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=421.64s)]
*  that we would not be able to prevent China [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=424.16s)]
*  or any other nation setting up their own bases [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=427.04s)]
*  on the outer islands. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=430.56s)]
*  And it appears the US is certainly glad of this deal. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=432.44s)]
*  Secretary of State Marco Rubio has called it [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=435.2s)]
*  a historic agreement. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=438.59999999999997s)]
*  And no doubt, this is a significant moment, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=439.44s)]
*  but it's not the end of the story [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=442.56s)]
*  because this deal extends US and UK military involvement [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=444.15999999999997s)]
*  on Diego Garcia. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=447.71999999999997s)]
*  And it extends the debate about the Chagoss islands past [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=449.47999999999996s)]
*  and their future. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gwa1f15p94&t=453.44s)]
