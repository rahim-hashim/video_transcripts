# Peace talks between Ukraine and Russia take place in Turkey | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ)
*  It's being reported in Turkey that two meetings will take place today as part of diplomatic [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=0.0s)]
*  efforts to end the war in Ukraine. The first is due to start at 7.45 GMT, so in under an hour's time, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=5.2s)]
*  and it will involve Turkish, US and Ukrainian officials. A second trilateral meeting is then [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=13.68s)]
*  expected to begin at 9.30 GMT, that's just over two hours from now. And it's being reported that it [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=19.68s)]
*  will bring together the Ukrainian and Russian delegations with Turkey mediating. Well, these [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=25.68s)]
*  come after no talks between Russia and Ukraine on Thursday, despite officials from both countries [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=31.36s)]
*  being in Istanbul. Ukraine's President Zelensky did fly to Turkey, as he'd promised, but Russia's [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=36.56s)]
*  President Putin did not. While the US Secretary of State Marco Rubioz arrived in Istanbul, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  he was attending a NATO meeting on Thursday and he gave his assessment of where things currently [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=48.0s)]
*  stand. We don't have high expectations of what will happen tomorrow. And frankly, at this point, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=53.6s)]
*  I think it's abundantly clear that the only way we're going to have a breakthrough here is between [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=59.92s)]
*  President Trump and President Putin. Marco Rubioz there, well, as we mentioned, Vladimir Putin has [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=65.36s)]
*  not made an appearance in Turkey, but his Ukrainian counterpart is there. Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=71.28s)]
*  Ukraine would send a delegation for these talks, but accused Russia of not treating them seriously. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=77.36s)]
*  And he said that his priority was an immediate end to the fighting. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=83.6s)]
*  I believe both sides must demonstrate their willingness to negotiate. The first step should [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=92.96s)]
*  be an unconditional ceasefire. If that can be achieved today at the level of technical groups [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=98.16s)]
*  without leaders, then okay, there is no need to meet. Well, a spokesperson for Russia's foreign [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=103.92s)]
*  ministry has labelled Mr Zelensky as a clown and a loser and pathetic. And while the diplomatic [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=110.72s)]
*  efforts are being made in Turkey, in Ukraine, however, the fighting continues, with Russia [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=118.16s)]
*  claiming its forces captured two more small settlements in the Donbass region on Thursday. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=123.36s)]
*  Well, BBC Monitoring's Russia editor and host of Ukrainecast Vitaly Shevchenko is in Istanbul [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=128.88s)]
*  with the very latest. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=134.08s)]
*  It's a low-level delegation led by presidential adviser Vladimir Medensky. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=164.56s)]
*  And Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine spent a lot of time thinking, does he send anyone to meet such [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=169.12s)]
*  a low-key figure? And he's dispatched his defense minister, Rustam Umarov, who's coming to Istanbul [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=175.04000000000002s)]
*  later today. I'll give an example of how different the Russian and Ukrainian positions are, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=183.36s)]
*  while Volodymyr Zelensky says that his team's mandate is focused on ceasing fire immediately. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=190.32s)]
*  The Russians, they've been saying throughout yesterday that they're focused on a long-term [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=199.51999999999998s)]
*  peace and removing the root causes of what they call this crisis. And translated from Kremlin [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=206.72s)]
*  speak, this is basically, it means that, no, they're not really interested in ceasing fire, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=214.4s)]
*  what they're interested in, addressing what started this war in Kremlin's point of view. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=220.72s)]
*  And that means the very existence of Ukraine as a sovereign state that can make decisions [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=225.76s)]
*  of its own. The presence of Marka Rubia here in Istanbul, it adds weight to what's going on, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=231.68s)]
*  even though he is not expecting much. Also, interestingly, the head of the Russian delegation, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=239.36s)]
*  Vladimir Medinsky, he said yesterday that Russia was prepared to discuss compromises. What that [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  means exactly is not clear, but hopefully, hopefully, it's a step forward and a sign of [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=252.96s)]
*  a little flexibility on Russia's part. So when you talk about these compromises that the Russian [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=259.28000000000003s)]
*  side are potentially prepared to discuss, we're not clear on what they will be. But if they are [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=264.56s)]
*  still focused on the root causes of this war, and as your point very much, Vitaly, saying that that [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=269.76s)]
*  has always been the very existence of Ukraine, where could possibly these potential compromises be? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=275.2s)]
*  We don't know. As simple as that. Vladimir Medinsky is the only person who meant, from the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=284.32s)]
*  Russian delegation, from Russia, who mentioned the word compromises. Everybody else was still [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=289.92s)]
*  saying no fresh weapons supplies to Ukraine, no more new fighters for the Ukrainian army, no [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=296.64000000000004s)]
*  NATO membership. We want, we, Russia, want at least five Ukrainian regions which Russia partly or fully [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=305.12s)]
*  occupies. All that, of course, is completely unacceptable for Vladimir Zelensky. But he's saying, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=314.96s)]
*  first step, ceasefire. We'll talk about everything else later. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej9QgA6HQYQ&t=321.91999999999996s)]
