Video Description: Hamas says it will hand over the bodies of four hostages on Thursday, including the two youngest people held by the Palestinian armed group.
 
The group's negotiator Khalil al-Hayya said the bodies to be released would include those of the Bibas family.
 
That includes Shiri and her young children Kfir and Ariel, who were aged nine months and four years when Hamas kidnapped them during the 7 October 2023 attack.
 
Their father Yarden was released by Hamas earlier this month.
 
In exchange, Israel will free all women and those under the age of 19 arrested since last October and is allowing some rubble-clearing equipment into Gaza through the border with Egypt.

**BBC - The Latest:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78)
*  Hamas will hand over to Israel the bodies of four hostages on Thursday. A further six [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=0.0s)]
*  living hostages will be freed on Saturday according to Israel. Let's get more from [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=5.96s)]
*  our correspondent in Jerusalem, Mark Lowen, who's there for us. Mark, how many hostages [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=11.36s)]
*  would that leave alive still in Gaza? It seems we're nearing the point where we need to talk [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=17.56s)]
*  about phase two. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=21.88s)]
*  Yeah, we are close to the total number now finally being released, Christian, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=24.84s)]
*  because there are 14 hostages who are still not back in Israel. So if there are [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=30.12s)]
*  four dead bodies that are handed over on Thursday, six living hostages on Saturday, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=34.52s)]
*  and then a further four dead bodies, says Hamas, next week, that will be the final [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=39.24s)]
*  14 of the first phase of this ceasefire deal. Now this Thursday is going to be a [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=43.32s)]
*  very painful moment for Israel because Hamas has just said that among the four [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=48.72s)]
*  bodies that they are going to hand over to Israel, the first dead hostages that [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=54.16s)]
*  they are handing over since the ceasefire was signed will be the Bibas [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=58.279999999999994s)]
*  family. Now that includes, if all of the Bibas family are among those four dead, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  that would include Shiri Bibas, who was seized on the 7th of October along with [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=72.19999999999999s)]
*  her husband Yarden, who was released earlier this month. You might remember [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=77.52s)]
*  he was one of those very emaciated men who was released by Hamas on the 1st of [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=81.56s)]
*  February, but also their two sons, Ariel, who was just four years old when he was [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=86.56s)]
*  kidnapped on the 7th of October, and Kefir, who was just nine months old. They [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  are the two youngest hostages who were taken on the 7th of October, and those [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=96.84s)]
*  Bibas boys have become really iconic symbols across Israel of the brutality [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=100.75999999999999s)]
*  of the Hamas attack on the 7th of October. They are on murals, they are very [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=106.88000000000001s)]
*  much seen as symbolic of the 7th of October attack. I was in Israel, I was on [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=112.60000000000001s)]
*  the hostage square actually for the first release of the hostages on the 19th of [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=118.48s)]
*  January, and there was actually a cake that was set up, a kind of mock tragically [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=123.32000000000001s)]
*  ironic cake that was set up on hostage square to mark the second birthday of [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=129.64000000000001s)]
*  Kefir Bibas, who would have been two on the day before the first release of the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=134.16s)]
*  hostages. Now Hamas says that all the Bibas family were killed in an Israeli [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=139.4s)]
*  bombardment in Gaza. Israel has never confirmed that. Just a quick line, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=144.28s)]
*  Israel is saying today that it will send a team to Qatar to begin the second [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=148.76s)]
*  phase of the ceasefire negotiation, and Hamas in the last few minutes saying [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=153.36s)]
*  that they are prepared to engage. Yeah, and it appeared last week that the whole [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=157.12s)]
*  ceasefire was hanging by a thread. There was then a release of hostages last week, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=164.92000000000002s)]
*  and now it appears that it's been brought back on track, and that [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=169.12s)]
*  progression to the second phase is very important because that would [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=174.56s)]
*  include talks on Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, which is bitterly [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=178.0s)]
*  contested by the right wing of Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet. I should just [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=181.6s)]
*  say, Christian, that in return for the releases that we were just talking about [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  by Hamas, Israel says it is going to free all women prisoners and those under the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=190.56s)]
*  age of 19 who were arrested since the 8th of October 2023, the day after the Hamas [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=197.44s)]
*  attacks, and they've also begun to allow some heavy equipment, rubble moving [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=202.32000000000002s)]
*  equipment, into Gaza from across the border in Egypt. That appears to be the [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=208.0s)]
*  And now, as you say, the fact that Israel is sending a negotiating team finally, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=212.8s)]
*  belatedly to Cairo, appears to suggest that the ceasefire talks at least are [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=217.48000000000002s)]
*  back on track. Whether we will get to phase two, that is a different matter. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=223.6s)]
*  Yeah, fragile, but some movement at least. Mark, thank you very much for that. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAiwB2fF78&t=227.48000000000002s)]
