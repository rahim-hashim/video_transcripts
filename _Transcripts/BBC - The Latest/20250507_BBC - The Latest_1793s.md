Video Description: Former US president Joe Biden has given his first interview since leaving the White House, telling the BBC that the pressure put on Ukraine by President Donald Trump to end its war with Russia amounts to "modern-day appeasement".

In his exclusive sit-down with Radio 4's Today programme, to mark the 80th anniversary of VE Day, Biden also reflected on the future of the alliance between the US and Europe.

Nick Robinson's interview with the former president is presented here in full, unedited form. It includes a question about Romania, which we acknowledge contains a factual inaccuracy but have retained in the interests of transparency.

*  On this special anniversary, we invited President Joe Biden to reflect on the history [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=43.040000000000006s)]
*  of what it teaches us now. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=49.68s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=61.92s)]
*  Real pleasure to meet you. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=63.44s)]
*  It's an honor to have you here. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=64.72s)]
*  I'm told you know this place. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=65.92s)]
*  I know this place, yep. It's the Hotel DuPont. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=67.84s)]
*  And this was the center of all activity in this town for a long, long time. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=71.2s)]
*  And am I right? You launched your senatorial campaign in this building. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=75.28s)]
*  I did in the main hall downstairs. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=78.64s)]
*  Please come and take a look. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=80.72s)]
*  You're almost a sacrilegious young democrat coming to Republican territory to announce. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=81.6s)]
*  That was what, just 50 years ago? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=89.12s)]
*  That's all. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=91.44s)]
*  Not long. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=93.04s)]
*  Yesterday. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=93.52s)]
*  Mr. President, thank you so much for talking to us. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=94.8s)]
*  Thanks for being here. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=97.44s)]
*  In this week of celebrations of VE Day, I've been looking back at a speech you made [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=99.28s)]
*  a year ago at Normandy for the 80th anniversary of D-Day. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=105.28s)]
*  And you said they knew beyond any doubt there are things worth fighting and dying for. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=110.4s)]
*  It's a message of sacrifice. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=118.4s)]
*  Do you fear that that message is being forgotten in America right now? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=120.08s)]
*  I do fear a little bit. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=126.08s)]
*  I don't think it's been forgotten by the people. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=127.92s)]
*  I think it's been forgotten by the leadership a little bit. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=130.16s)]
*  Excuse my cough. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  The fact is that my father and mother's generation knew what was at stake. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=133.92s)]
*  They knew that democracy was literally hanging in the balance. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=142.16s)]
*  Adolf Hitler, had he won, had there been no United Europe and United with the United States. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=146.16s)]
*  You know, the United States has never been able to avoid a war in Europe. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=152.56s)]
*  And so one of the smartest things we did after World War II was we formed NATO. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=157.11999999999998s)]
*  Because alliances provide security. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=163.92s)]
*  And imagine had we not done that. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=167.2s)]
*  So and the other thing, I had been to a landing on D-Day, a reenactment of that event, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=171.6s)]
*  not the 80th earlier. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=180.23999999999998s)]
*  And coming in on one of those boats, those landing craft, and the thousands of ships [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=182.64s)]
*  were out there and the tens of thousands of men and women, mostly men, who stormed the beaches. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=190.0s)]
*  And then how they scale those cliffs. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=196.72s)]
*  You know, six or six thousand grave sites there. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=202.4s)]
*  Six thousand. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=206.32s)]
*  That's what's in your mind on this week. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=208.48s)]
*  And you know, anyway, I just, the world has gotten smaller. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=211.2s)]
*  And so imagine if we didn't have NATO now, what would be happening in the Mediterranean? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=217.52s)]
*  What would be happening with regard to activity by Russia and China in the region? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=228.88s)]
*  But NATO is the strongest alliance in the history of the world. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=236.88s)]
*  You say imagine. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=240.96s)]
*  Can you imagine it now? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  Because there are some people who fear that this Atlantic alliance born in the second world war [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=244.0s)]
*  is now dying before our very eyes. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=249.76s)]
*  Is that your concern? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=251.92s)]
*  It's a grave concern. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=253.76s)]
*  I think it would change the modern history of the world if that occurs. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=255.2s)]
*  Look, we are not the essential nation, but we're the only nation in a position [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=261.52s)]
*  to have the capacity to bring people together to lead the world. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=269.92s)]
*  And otherwise, you're going to have China and the former Soviet Union, Russia stepping up. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=276.32s)]
*  And when I say inflection points, there's so much change taking place so rapidly [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=284.56s)]
*  that there needs to be an ability to respond rapidly. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=291.12s)]
*  And I just think to myself, what would have happened in the Middle East as bad as things are now [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=295.36s)]
*  were there no NATO? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=302.96000000000004s)]
*  Do you think Russia and China would have stayed out militarily? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=304.08000000000004s)]
*  Anyway, the center of NATO is this promise, isn't it? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=309.28000000000003s)]
*  You called it in a speech I saw in Warsaw a few years ago, a sacred obligation, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=312.88s)]
*  which is you defend each other. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=319.20000000000005s)]
*  Do you think Donald... [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=321.84000000000003s)]
*  One is an attack on all. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=322.72s)]
*  Do you believe that obligation is still respected by Donald Trump? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=325.68s)]
*  Well, he doesn't say it is. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=333.12s)]
*  And I think the rest of the world, I know... [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=336.16s)]
*  One of the only advantages of being the old guy is that I've known every major world leader [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=340.32000000000005s)]
*  in the last 30 years and I've known them personally. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=345.92s)]
*  And I know all the major world leaders today. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=349.12s)]
*  And I can tell you the last meeting of the G7, the meeting of NATO 7... [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=354.08000000000004s)]
*  Anyway, the... [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=361.04s)]
*  Or the G20, which is a larger group. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=363.92s)]
*  As we left the meeting, almost every world leader would pull me aside and say, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  We've got to keep NATO. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=372.8s)]
*  My democracy is at stake. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=375.84s)]
*  Every generation, every generation is the fight to maintain democracy. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=377.84s)]
*  Everyone. Everyone's going to be challenged. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=382.8s)]
*  And we've done it well for the last 80 years. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=386.0s)]
*  And I'm worried that there's a loss of understanding of the consequence of that. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=389.52s)]
*  You've talked about a great threat to democracy. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=394.32s)]
*  Do you really believe that there is a greater threat now? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=397.84s)]
*  To democracy than at any time since the Second World War? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=402.47999999999996s)]
*  Yes, I do. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=406.0s)]
*  Because, I mean, look at the number of European leaders in European countries. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=407.35999999999996s)]
*  They're wondering, well, what do I do now? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=413.2s)]
*  I mean, what's the best route for me to take? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=416.0s)]
*  Can I rely on the United States? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=419.2s)]
*  Are they going to be there? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=421.12s)]
*  Not alone in the United States. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=422.4s)]
*  Will this stay together? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=425.03999999999996s)]
*  And, you know, instead of democracy expanding around the world, they're receding. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=427.04s)]
*  And democracy is, every generation has to fight for it. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=434.48s)]
*  And yet you hear what's being said by this administration. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=440.48s)]
*  The Vice President, JD Vance, complains about European freeloading, he calls it. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=443.92s)]
*  The defense secretary, let me just repeat that. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=449.76000000000005s)]
*  You know what they're saying in this administration. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=454.4s)]
*  The US defense secretary talks about European freeloading. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=456.47999999999996s)]
*  The Vice President talks about your country, the United States, bailing out Europe. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=459.35999999999996s)]
*  There's an anger there. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=465.84s)]
*  Have they not got a point? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=467.12s)]
*  No, they don't have a point. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=468.79999999999995s)]
*  Look, you have of all the NATO nations, almost all of our 2% right now. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=470.15999999999997s)]
*  But what they've done is, you know, when we were attacked, what happened on 9-11? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=477.59999999999997s)]
*  They all responded, supported us. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=484.88s)]
*  Look, imagine there being no NATO. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=488.88s)]
*  Do you think Putin would have stopped Ukraine? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=495.03999999999996s)]
*  Do we think Putin would have stopped? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=501.12s)]
*  I don't understand how they failed to understand that there's strength in alliances. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=508.0s)]
*  There's benefits, the costs there. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=514.64s)]
*  It saves us money overall. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=516.56s)]
*  Let's turn to Ukraine, can we? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=519.36s)]
*  Because you compared the war in Ukraine with the Second World War. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=520.72s)]
*  President Trump is now saying, look, if you want peace, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=526.0799999999999s)]
*  Ukraine is going to have to give up some territory. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=529.12s)]
*  Some people think that is common sense to say that. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=531.52s)]
*  Do you think it's not common sense? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=534.88s)]
*  It's perhaps modern-day appeasement? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=537.6s)]
*  It is modern-day appeasement. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=540.0s)]
*  Look, listen to what Putin said when he talked about going from Kiev into Ukraine and why. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=541.6s)]
*  He believed it was part of Mother Russia. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=556.8000000000001s)]
*  He believes it was the historical rights of Ukraine. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=559.52s)]
*  He talks about Eastern Europe. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=562.72s)]
*  What this man wants to do is reestablish the Warsaw Pact. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=565.28s)]
*  He can't stand the fact that the Russian dictatorship that he runs, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=567.84s)]
*  that the Soviet Union has collapsed. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=577.2800000000001s)]
*  And anybody thinks he's going to stop is just foolish. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=583.44s)]
*  And look, we have billion-dollar economies with economic exchange with Europe. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=587.84s)]
*  I just don't understand how people think that if we allow a dictator, a thug, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=595.2s)]
*  to decide he's going to take significant portions of land that aren't his, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=605.0400000000001s)]
*  and that's going to satisfy him, I don't quite understand. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=611.52s)]
*  So you call it appeasement. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=614.48s)]
*  What might happen if the Trump administration says, look, that's the deal. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=615.6s)]
*  You've got to give this territory up, at least temporarily. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=619.84s)]
*  What is your fear of the consequence of that? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=623.12s)]
*  My fear of the consequence is that some of the NATO countries are going to decide that [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=625.76s)]
*  maybe, especially those along the border with Russia, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=632.4s)]
*  they just say we've got to make an accommodation. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=636.24s)]
*  We've got to make an accommodation. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=638.9599999999999s)]
*  We've got to give Russia more space. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=640.88s)]
*  We've got to go on. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=642.48s)]
*  We have to yield to the pressures, whether they're economic, political, or military. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=644.24s)]
*  And so you see countries like Romania, for example, having a presidential election, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=649.76s)]
*  choosing people who are Putin's friends. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=655.0400000000001s)]
*  I don't even want to say it. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=659.36s)]
*  Yeah, I worry about it. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=661.52s)]
*  What did you make of those scenes in the Oval Office, President Trump and President Zelensky? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=663.84s)]
*  I found it sort of beneath America, the way that took place, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=668.72s)]
*  and the way we talk about now that, well, it's the Gulf of America. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=684.64s)]
*  Maybe we're going to have to take back Panama. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=691.12s)]
*  Maybe we need to acquire Greenland. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=694.4s)]
*  Maybe Canada should be different. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=697.28s)]
*  What the hell's going on here? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=698.72s)]
*  What president ever talks like that? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=701.6800000000001s)]
*  That's not who we are. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=704.32s)]
*  We're about freedom, democracy, opportunity, not about confiscation. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=706.5600000000001s)]
*  Does that mean, do you think, that that talk destroys the alliances that the United States [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=712.96s)]
*  of the Independent... [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=719.36s)]
*  Well, it destroys it and weakens it considerably. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=719.9200000000001s)]
*  Weakens it considerably. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=723.12s)]
*  I mean, Canada, the way we talk about Canada is like a... [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=725.12s)]
*  As if it could be a 51st state. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=728.48s)]
*  Canada's been an ally of... [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=731.36s)]
*  Look, we have an actually really good advantage. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=732.5600000000001s)]
*  One of the reasons why we thought it was important to be a thing called NATO. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=735.5200000000001s)]
*  We had the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean on the east and our west. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=738.72s)]
*  Canada and Mexico on the north and our south. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=742.5600000000001s)]
*  What does Britain have? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=745.7600000000001s)]
*  Well, what does all France... [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=746.88s)]
*  What are they surrounded by? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=748.24s)]
*  They're surrounded by countries that have been in war off and on for the last 500 years. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=750.4000000000001s)]
*  And NATO brought stability. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=755.2800000000001s)]
*  You will know what they sometimes say of you, sir. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=758.72s)]
*  They sometimes say, look, President Biden warned us about this invasion of Ukraine. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=761.12s)]
*  He did. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=765.9200000000001s)]
*  He led the West in standing up to Putin. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=767.2800000000001s)]
*  He did that. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=769.7600000000001s)]
*  But they sometimes say that you didn't have the courage to go all the way to let Ukraine win. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=771.44s)]
*  You let them stop the invasion, but you didn't give them the weapons they needed, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=777.2800000000001s)]
*  the long range weapons to really win. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=780.72s)]
*  Well, a few people do say that, but the idea that they could win without engaging NATO in a war, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=786.24s)]
*  NATO having engaged the Soviet Union, former Soviet Union, Russia, is not likely. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=795.36s)]
*  We gave them everything they needed to provide for their independence. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=804.32s)]
*  And we were prepared to respond more aggressively if, in fact, Putin moved again. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=811.36s)]
*  But we needed to... [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=821.44s)]
*  This is a tricky thing. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=824.0s)]
*  We had Poland now. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=826.5600000000001s)]
*  Poland is a NATO country. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=829.12s)]
*  Poland used to be in a situation where it was part of the Warsaw Pact. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=833.28s)]
*  There's just a lot of change taking place. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=838.6400000000001s)]
*  And the idea that we're ready to go to World War III through nuclear powers could be avoided. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=841.84s)]
*  We did avoid it, but we also made... [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=850.72s)]
*  That was the threat, though. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=852.5600000000001s)]
*  That was the worry in your mind. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=853.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=855.36s)]
*  Go too hard against Russia. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=856.8000000000001s)]
*  Nuclear weapons are used. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=858.96s)]
*  Go too hard against Russian territory, yes. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=860.6400000000001s)]
*  Up to now, it wasn't involving the Soviet Union. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=863.7600000000001s)]
*  Up to now, it wasn't involving Russian territory. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=866.8000000000001s)]
*  And, you know, what did... [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=869.84s)]
*  What did Putin do when things got really tough for him? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=872.32s)]
*  Threatening the use of tactical nuclear weapons. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=875.6s)]
*  This is a... [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=880.48s)]
*  This is not a game roulette. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=882.88s)]
*  It's a frightening time. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=884.96s)]
*  Now, I can tell how angry you are, I think, with some of the things that your successor, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=885.9200000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump, has been saying and doing. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=892.0s)]
*  You say it's not who we are. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=894.1600000000001s)]
*  It's not America. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=896.0799999999999s)]
*  The other day, you said in a speech, nobody is king. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=898.0s)]
*  Do you think he's behaving more like a monarch than a president? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=901.8399999999999s)]
*  Oh, I'd rather not comment. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=905.6s)]
*  I'm not sure how he's been. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=907.36s)]
*  He's not behaving like a Republican president. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=908.64s)]
*  You've been diplomatic, sir. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=915.1999999999999s)]
*  What do you say about his 100 days? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=918.64s)]
*  Now, he says, look at all these things I've achieved. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=920.16s)]
*  I've closed the border. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=922.0s)]
*  I've started to bring jobs back to the United States. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=923.36s)]
*  I'm cutting government waste. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=925.76s)]
*  He says he's delivering what people voted for. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=927.6s)]
*  Let me tell you, when I left office, we had created more jobs than any president in history [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=930.3199999999999s)]
*  in the United States in one term. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=935.4399999999999s)]
*  Our economy was roaring. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=938.0s)]
*  We were moving in a direction where the stock market was way up. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=940.4s)]
*  We were in a situation where we were expanding our influence around the world in a positive way, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=943.92s)]
*  increasing trade. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=949.76s)]
*  We regained control of what we invented, the future of computer chips, which control everything. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=951.4399999999999s)]
*  We were in a situation where there was growth, opportunity. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=963.12s)]
*  For example, they told me, remember Trump had this plan. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=969.84s)]
*  He was going to rebuild America, increase our infrastructure. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=973.4399999999999s)]
*  We had infrastructure weak for four years and nothing was built. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=979.12s)]
*  I was able to convince the Congress and the American people to accept $1.3 trillion in economic growth. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=982.4s)]
*  So he says his 100 days is a triumph. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=988.16s)]
*  What does President Biden say about Trump's first 100 days? [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=990.16s)]
*  I'll let history judge that. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=994.24s)]
*  I don't see anything that was triumphant. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=995.6s)]
*  And you see things to worry about. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=999.52s)]
*  Do you, when you talk of a threat to democracy, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1001.12s)]
*  worry about a threat to democracy here at home, here in the United States? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1004.0s)]
*  I'm less concerned about that than I was because I think the Republican Party is waking up to what Trump is about. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1009.44s)]
*  Do you think they may fight back? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1020.64s)]
*  I think the beginning, yes. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1022.88s)]
*  But you will know people see laws apparently being broken, courts ignored, Congress sidelined. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1025.44s)]
*  They don't like what they see. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1033.92s)]
*  Well, I think they're seeing that too. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1035.92s)]
*  I think that's why you're not. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1038.16s)]
*  I don't think you'll succeed in that effort. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1040.3999999999999s)]
*  Let's return to where we began our conversation. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1043.2s)]
*  You have this powerful phrase about an inflection point. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1045.2s)]
*  You said once that we're living through a dramatic change in the world of the sort you only see every, what, six or eight generations. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1050.72s)]
*  Young people are very frightened at the moment. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1061.44s)]
*  I think possibly more frightened than any time I can remember in my lifetime. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1065.2s)]
*  Are they right to be? [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1069.1200000000001s)]
*  Right to be concerned. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1070.88s)]
*  That's why they have to be involved. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1071.76s)]
*  Have to be involved. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1074.0s)]
*  They have to get engaged. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1074.8s)]
*  They have to be part of the political process. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1075.92s)]
*  They have to vote. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1078.4s)]
*  They have to make sure they make their views known. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1079.28s)]
*  And I think it's, I think it may be also a wake-up call to that generation. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1082.64s)]
*  There's a, look, think about this. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1090.0s)]
*  The idea of the United States is deciding to significantly reduce its work in terms of technical advancements. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1094.72s)]
*  It's, look, how can you remain the most powerful nation in the world and have a second-rate infrastructure? [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1106.56s)]
*  How can you maintain the most powerful nation in the world with a second-rate education system? [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1113.52s)]
*  How can you be the most powerful nation in the world if you don't have the ability to provide opportunity for a vast majority of the American people? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1119.92s)]
*  Look, my dad used to have an expression. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1127.3600000000001s)]
*  He'd say, look, Joey, everybody in America deserves a shot. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1130.16s)]
*  That's a shot. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1134.24s)]
*  That's a shot. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1135.76s)]
*  That's why I changed the economic model. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1136.48s)]
*  We talk about, instead of trickle-down economics, as my dad would say, not a whole lot trickled down to his kitchen table. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1138.88s)]
*  But I tell you what, we grew the economy from the middle out and the bottom up. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1145.44s)]
*  I focused on that. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1148.72s)]
*  The wealthy are still doing very well. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1150.16s)]
*  They've got to start paying their taxes a little more, number one. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1152.24s)]
*  But number two, they also, the middle class is growing. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1155.2s)]
*  Hope is a word that you've often liked to use. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1160.4s)]
*  Hope instead of fear. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1163.28s)]
*  And when you moved into the Oval Office, up on the wall there was Franklin Delano Roosevelt. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1165.3600000000001s)]
*  He talked about the triumph of hope over fear. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1171.52s)]
*  He was, of course, America's wartime leader. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1174.08s)]
*  Do you fear that the America that we've seen ever since that time is ending? [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1177.04s)]
*  The Atlantic alliance we've seen ever since that time? [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1184.56s)]
*  No, here's what I fear. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1187.12s)]
*  I fear that our allies around the world are going to begin to doubt whether we're going to stay where we've always been the last eight years. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1189.28s)]
*  For example, when we had the first G7 meeting, that is the leaders of the European nations in England hosted by your government, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1203.28s)]
*  we sat down the first meeting, I think it was in February, my first year. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1214.8s)]
*  And I sat there and I looked and I said, America's back. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1220.24s)]
*  And Manuel looked at me and said, for how long? [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1224.16s)]
*  For how long? [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1226.32s)]
*  I take some responsibility and credit for rebuilding NATO. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1228.32s)]
*  We added two significant powers to NATO. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1237.52s)]
*  Ten days before Dr. Kissinger died, he called me. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1243.2s)]
*  He said, not since Napoleon, as Paris not looked over its shoulder at Moscow with a feeling of dread, till you came along. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1246.56s)]
*  NATO is stronger. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1253.6s)]
*  They can't do that. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1254.8799999999999s)]
*  They know. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1255.76s)]
*  And so in the meantime, I still remember what Manuel said. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1256.96s)]
*  He said, for how long? [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1262.08s)]
*  Now here we are. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1264.16s)]
*  We did all that. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1264.8s)]
*  And in four years, we got a guy who wants to walk away from it all. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1266.48s)]
*  I'm worried that Europe's going to lose confidence in the certainty of America and the leadership of America in the world to deal with not only NATO, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1271.52s)]
*  but other matters that have a consequence. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1282.24s)]
*  Look, what did we do? [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1283.92s)]
*  I was able to put together AUKUS. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1284.96s)]
*  That is an alliance in Asia, Australia, Japan, the United States, India. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1287.1200000000001s)]
*  I mean, the idea that we're in a situation where we're we've moved in a direction that, for example, in Africa, Africa's going to have 50% of the world's population. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1293.92s)]
*  50% of the world's population, I think, is by 2080. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1304.64s)]
*  I can hear your passion. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1308.88s)]
*  I can hear your anxiety that the world is changing the way it has. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1310.88s)]
*  And for a long time, you believed. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1315.28s)]
*  You said, I'm the man who can stop Donald Trump. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1317.76s)]
*  And you did once. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1321.04s)]
*  And in the end, you withdrew from that election campaign at the last minute. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1322.88s)]
*  It's a question, you know, lots of people ask you, Mr. President. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1328.88s)]
*  Did you leave it too late? [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1332.56s)]
*  Should you have withdrawn earlier, given someone else a bigger chance? [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1334.8s)]
*  I don't think it would have mattered. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1338.64s)]
*  We left at a time when we were we had a good candidate. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1344.96s)]
*  She's fully funded. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1351.52s)]
*  And what happened was. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1354.4s)]
*  I had become what we had set out to do. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1358.16s)]
*  No one thought we could do. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1362.16s)]
*  And become so successful on our agenda, it was hard to say, now I'm going to stop now. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1364.16s)]
*  I meant when I said when I started that I think I'm prepared to hand this to the next generation. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1369.68s)]
*  The transition government. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1376.16s)]
*  But things move so quickly that it made it difficult to walk away to get. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1378.72s)]
*  And it was a. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1386.32s)]
*  It was a hard decision. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1390.8s)]
*  But regrets that. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1392.8s)]
*  No, I think it was the right decision. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1396.32s)]
*  I think that. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1398.96s)]
*  Well. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1403.6000000000001s)]
*  It was just a difficult decision. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1405.6000000000001s)]
*  But you shouldn't have taken it earlier. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1408.56s)]
*  Well, I don't I don't I don't think so. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1410.88s)]
*  I mean, I don't know how that would have made much difference. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1412.88s)]
*  I want to thank you for giving us this interview on VE Day and give you a chance just to reflect finally. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1417.68s)]
*  A little bit about the people you've met over the years because [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1423.52s)]
*  you were telling me when I first met you about the veterans that you've met [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1426.56s)]
*  last year in Normandy when you went for the 80th anniversary of D Day. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1431.44s)]
*  Incredible generation and they're fading out. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1436.6399999999999s)]
*  And one I sat with them and they talked about how how much it mattered to them. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1440.8799999999999s)]
*  How much what they were proud that they had stopped this fascism. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1448.3999999999999s)]
*  What they had done. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1454.48s)]
*  You know, I was I was in the cemetery. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1456.56s)]
*  The year two years before when I went over to Normandy and I was walking through the graveyards. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1461.6s)]
*  Graveyard meticulously kept in the American cemetery and thousands of dead Americans. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1470.6399999999999s)]
*  And I looked and I and down I thought I saw there was a two crosses. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1478.0s)]
*  Next one of the father and the son. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1483.76s)]
*  I thought my God, I'm just not kneeling but squat it down. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1486.08s)]
*  And all of a sudden I heard behind me, TANCH UP! [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1491.2s)]
*  I turned around there was a gentleman with a VFW hat on, a veteran's hat on. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1494.0s)]
*  And he saluted me. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1498.8s)]
*  He said, I said, I salute him. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1500.72s)]
*  I said, thank you. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1503.12s)]
*  Thank you for what you did. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1504.32s)]
*  And he put his hand on his wife's shoulder and said, no, no, thank her. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1505.76s)]
*  She did it. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1509.2s)]
*  And I looked at him and he said, he said, she was part. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1510.56s)]
*  She was part of the effort. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1514.4s)]
*  She built the ships that got us here. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1515.76s)]
*  She built that stepped up the entire generation. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1518.48s)]
*  Women of our country stepped up. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1522.24s)]
*  He said, I'm so proud of her. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1524.32s)]
*  I'm so proud of her. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1526.24s)]
*  The men and women I met knew when they got off of landing craft, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1529.36s)]
*  when they came in on those gliders, that there was likely to die as live. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1534.72s)]
*  And they did it. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1539.04s)]
*  They did it anyway. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1540.4s)]
*  Because they felt it was worth dying for if need be. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1542.24s)]
*  They had to stop this maniac Hitler. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1545.2s)]
*  They had to maintain democracy. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1548.8s)]
*  They're willing to give their lives to do it. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1551.2s)]
*  An incredible, incredible, incredible generation. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1553.1200000000001s)]
*  And finally, this is about values as well, isn't it? [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1557.1200000000001s)]
*  You've talked very movingly about your late son, Bo, who served in Iraq [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1560.96s)]
*  and said that in many ways the values he embodied [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1566.96s)]
*  were like the values embodied by the wartime generation. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1570.32s)]
*  Is that the plea that you want to make for those values to be maintained in your country? [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1573.76s)]
*  It is. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1580.24s)]
*  Look, my son was a good man. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1581.12s)]
*  And my dad used to have a saying. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1588.0s)]
*  He said, look, Joey, everyone, everyone's entitled to be treated with dignity, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1592.56s)]
*  no matter who they are, no matter where they're from. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1598.72s)]
*  And my son ran for attorney general and won. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1602.0s)]
*  And he was a likely candidate for governor. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1609.28s)]
*  He was offered the Senate seat, and he turned it down [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1615.36s)]
*  because he didn't want to be given the Senate seat, appointed. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1618.32s)]
*  And one day I came home on a Friday, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1622.56s)]
*  and I came home, I got a call on a Monday, I said, what are you doing Friday, Dad? [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1627.2s)]
*  And I said, now what do you need? [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1633.36s)]
*  He said, I want you to pin my bars on. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1634.32s)]
*  I said, pin your bars on? [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1635.84s)]
*  You're marrying him too? [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1638.48s)]
*  What do you want? [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1639.28s)]
*  I joined the National Guard. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1639.84s)]
*  I think I have an obligation as an attorney general. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1640.96s)]
*  When his unit got sent to Iraq, he decided he had to go with them. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1645.52s)]
*  They wouldn't let him go because you're either state property [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1653.84s)]
*  or federal property. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1656.56s)]
*  If you're a National Guard, you're the state. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1657.52s)]
*  So he decided that he, so I, the National Guard kept coming to Washington. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1660.72s)]
*  He was able to work it out so he would give up his attorney general's job [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1666.1599999999999s)]
*  while he was in the National Guard, and he went to Iraq for a year [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1670.24s)]
*  because he thought it was his duty to do so. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1675.84s)]
*  Unfortunately, he lived not very far from a burn pit, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1679.44s)]
*  and he acquired stage four glioblastoma, more brain disease than anyone, and he died. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1683.2s)]
*  This VE Day, your minds are on finally the values of people like your son [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1691.28s)]
*  and people like you met in Normandy. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1697.52s)]
*  And I still think that the values of the vast majority of the American people value. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1699.84s)]
*  Do everything we can to avoid war, but not yield the tyrants, not yield. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1705.6s)]
*  President Biden, thank you very much for your time. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1712.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1714.8s)]
*  It's clear that the passion which drove Joe Biden into politics [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1717.6s)]
*  in this magnificent hotel in Wilmington in Delaware is undimmed. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1721.04s)]
*  Clear too that the belief of the man who was born in the Second World War [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1726.0s)]
*  in the importance of the Atlantic Alliance is undiminished. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1730.96s)]
*  Perhaps that's one explanation for why he ignored for so long those who were saying [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1735.04s)]
*  he needed to withdraw from the race against Donald Trump. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1739.68s)]
*  He and others are now left to reflect whether a different decision would have made any difference. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1744.16s)]
*  I sense that he believes that we are though at what he calls an inflection point, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1749.8400000000001s)]
*  a once in five or six generation moment of change. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1754.96s)]
*  A change that means pretty much everything he's taken for granted [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1759.76s)]
*  for his whole adult life will now be different. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1762.88s)]
*  That's it from this edition of Political Thinking. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1767.12s)]
*  Thank you for watching. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INuwqHzBFC0&t=1770.72s)]
