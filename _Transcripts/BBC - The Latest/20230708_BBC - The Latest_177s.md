Video Description: The Dutch government has collapsed because of a disagreement between coalition parties over asylum policies, Prime Minister Mark Rutte has said.

The four parties were unable to find agreement in crisis talks chaired by Mr Rutte on Friday.

The government was set up a year and a half ago but the parties have been opposed on migration for some time.

# Dutch coalition government collapses in migration row - BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [July 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy4CFGvQk5Y)
*  The Dutch Prime Minister has been meeting with the country's king to discuss the formation of a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy4CFGvQk5Y&t=0.0s)]
*  caretaker administration after the collapse of his coalition government. Mark Rutte left the palace [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy4CFGvQk5Y&t=4.72s)]
*  after talks with King Wilhelm Alexander. Mr Rutte announced late on Friday that his entire cabinet [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy4CFGvQk5Y&t=10.64s)]
*  had resigned after it failed to agree on stricter immigration policies. New elections are not [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy4CFGvQk5Y&t=16.32s)]
*  expected to be held before mid-November. Let's get more on this now with Professor Sarah de Lange, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy4CFGvQk5Y&t=22.32s)]
*  a political scientist from the University of Amsterdam. Thanks very much for joining us. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy4CFGvQk5Y&t=27.92s)]
*  Are you able to just talk us through how we've got to this situation that we're in now? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy4CFGvQk5Y&t=33.28s)]
*  Yes, well it took a long time to form the current cabinet, almost a year, and we knew from the start [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy4CFGvQk5Y&t=38.88s)]
*  that it was quite unstable because the coalition partners didn't agree on immigration policy. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy4CFGvQk5Y&t=44.96s)]
*  And with increasing influx of immigrants into the Netherlands in the past two years, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy4CFGvQk5Y&t=51.92s)]
*  this has really become a contentious issue in the cabinet. And yesterday the parties decided [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy4CFGvQk5Y&t=56.8s)]
*  that they couldn't reach an agreement on the different ways in which the influx could be [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy4CFGvQk5Y&t=62.8s)]
*  reduced and especially how they could lower the number of citizens coming to the Netherlands [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy4CFGvQk5Y&t=67.44s)]
*  for reasons of family reunification. So there's a sort of caretaker cabinet now, is there? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy4CFGvQk5Y&t=73.36s)]
*  Yes, there will be a caretaker cabinet in place because in the Netherlands it takes at least three [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy4CFGvQk5Y&t=81.2s)]
*  months to organize new elections and we're also currently at the start of the summer recess. So [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy4CFGvQk5Y&t=86.48s)]
*  this will come on top of those 90 days. But the parliament will decide which issues will [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy4CFGvQk5Y&t=92.56s)]
*  become controversial and the caretaker cabinet cannot decide on which kinds of issues will be [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy4CFGvQk5Y&t=100.32000000000001s)]
*  considered ordinary business. So for example, when it comes to the war in Ukraine, the defense [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy4CFGvQk5Y&t=107.36s)]
*  minister will be allowed probably to still make decisions given the urgency of the situation. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy4CFGvQk5Y&t=112.56s)]
*  Yeah, and just recently Mr. Rutte was trying to get this plan through which would cut the number [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy4CFGvQk5Y&t=119.2s)]
*  of relatives of war refugees allowed to come into the Netherlands, didn't he? He couldn't get that [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy4CFGvQk5Y&t=123.04s)]
*  through. But in terms of public opinion, where does the most support lie on the decisions on this? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy4CFGvQk5Y&t=128.8s)]
*  Well, the citizens are divided in the Netherlands on the issue of immigration like in other West [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy4CFGvQk5Y&t=136.32s)]
*  European countries. It's quite a polarized issue. The supporters for Rutte's VVD as well [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy4CFGvQk5Y&t=141.92000000000002s)]
*  of the other right-wing parties, most notably the Citizens' Farmers Movement and Geert Wilders' PVV [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy4CFGvQk5Y&t=149.44s)]
*  are very much in favor of stricter migration policies. But the supporters of some of the [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy4CFGvQk5Y&t=156.08s)]
*  governing parties, most notably the Social Liberal D66 for example, are in favor of more liberal [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy4CFGvQk5Y&t=161.44s)]
*  policies on this issue. Okay, well thank you very much for talking us through it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy4CFGvQk5Y&t=167.12s)]
*  Sarah Delaney there, I appreciate your time. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy4CFGvQk5Y&t=171.52s)]
