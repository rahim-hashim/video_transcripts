Video Description: A BBC investigation has used computer generated reconstructions to reveal what life is like inside Cecot, El Salvador’s so-called ‘mega-jail’. 

The reconstruction was made possible thanks to videos and photos shared by the government, and media outlets who were given access to the prison before it opened.

Cecot has become a symbol of President Nayib Bukele’s notorious "war against gangs", which the country’s ministry of security says has resulted in the detention of at least 68,000 people since the campaign began in March 2022.

*  information released about who exactly is being held or conditions there in the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=14.36s)]
*  prison. Now an investigation by BBC Mundo has used computer generated [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=20.04s)]
*  reconstructions to reveal what life is like inside the mega jails cells. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=25.36s)]
*  Larry Ventas reports. This government footage of El Salvador's so-called mega [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=31.6s)]
*  prison went viral when it was released in February. It's called the Terrorism [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=37.4s)]
*  Confinement Center or CICOT. It's the centerpiece of Salvadoran president [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  Nayib Bukele's self-declared war on guns. Since the huge media campaign that [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=47.8s)]
*  surrendered its opening there has been no other information about life inside [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=54.16s)]
*  CICOT. Relatives of those detained have been desperately trying to find out [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=58.4s)]
*  what's happened to them. I saw the video on Facebook and I was going through it [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=64.2s)]
*  buzzing and rewinding. He was almost unrecognizable, so very thin. I only knew [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=69.8s)]
*  it was him by his tattoos. Angelica says her husband has no links with gangs. She's [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=74.64s)]
*  heard nothing further about him since he was arrested under emergency powers [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=81.4s)]
*  brought in in March 2022 by president Bukele. Through satellite imagery data [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  released by the Salvadoran government and documents seen by BBC Mundo we've [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=93.36000000000001s)]
*  gathered information about the site. There are eight cell blocks monitored by [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  19 watchtowers. Inside the cells the beds are metal plates and there are two [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=104.42s)]
*  toilets open to the room. So far the authorities say they have transferred [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=111.28s)]
*  4,000 prisoners to jail and that there is capacity for up to 40,000. The BBC [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=117.36s)]
*  has found that at full capacity each person would have 0.58 square meters of [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=124.36s)]
*  space. The International Committee of the Red Cross recommends 3.4 square meters [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  in a shared cell. Since the emergency anti-gang measures were introduced at [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=135.48s)]
*  least 68,000 people have been arrested and crime has plummeted. Last year the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=141.16s)]
*  murder rate fell by 56.8%. President Bukele and his policies are [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=148.72s)]
*  extremely popular. But human rights groups and protesters say the measures [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=156.48s)]
*  have led to serious human rights abuses. Conditions at Zikot could become [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=162.48s)]
*  inhumane and degrading because no one has access to that prison. No lawyers, no [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=171.44s)]
*  ombudsman, not even the media can enter and verify the conditions inside. During [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=177.23999999999998s)]
*  a BBC interview in March the security minister said this about Zikot. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=182.88s)]
*  This is the biggest monument to justice we have ever built. We have nothing to hide. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=189.52s)]
*  The members of these terrorist organizations are the ones who will go [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=194.16s)]
*  to Zikot. We have made a commitment to the people of El Salvador that they [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=198.32000000000002s)]
*  will never be released to the communities. BBC Mundo asked to film [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=202.36s)]
*  inside Zikot for an interview with the government to address the wider issues [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=207.32000000000002s)]
*  in this report but they declined to comment. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=211.60000000000002s)]
*  Ley de Ventas, BBC News. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=215.24s)]
*  And we speak now to BBC Mundo's Marcos González. Good to see you. So questions [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=218.84s)]
*  inevitably thrown up by this report and this investigation. What are the main [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=225.04s)]
*  questions around human rights and legal issues? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=229.48000000000002s)]
*  Well there are many, many, many questions around these mega jails for [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=234.04s)]
*  months after it's opening. For instance we don't know who are the people there. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=239.92s)]
*  It's supposed to be for the main leaders of the two main gangs in El Salvador [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=245.32s)]
*  which are the Mara Salvatrucha and Barrio Dieci Ocho but we know nothing about [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=250.84s)]
*  their identities or why there are at least officially 4,000 people in this [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=257.08s)]
*  mega jail if the maximum capacity is for 40,000 people. So again this is [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=263.64s)]
*  especially a worry for the relatives as we saw in the video as they know, they [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=270.32s)]
*  don't know, they know nothing about the location of the so many people who have [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=275.2s)]
*  been arrested during the last year of the state of emergency in El Salvador. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=280.56s)]
*  But secondly and maybe even more important is that we know very little [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=285.36s)]
*  about the conditions inside this mega jail. That's why we at the BBC Mundo we [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=289.96s)]
*  have a recreated in this special investigation some details of the jail, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=295.47999999999996s)]
*  of the cells so you know you can have like a context, like a general idea about [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=301.79999999999995s)]
*  how are these people living inside these cells. And again we saw for instance [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=307.08s)]
*  according to some documents shared with us by an engineer who was involved in [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=314.32s)]
*  the construction of the mega jail, we saw that each prisoner has a space in each [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=319.24s)]
*  cell which is almost six times smaller than the official recommendation by the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=325.40000000000003s)]
*  Red Cross. The thing is that no one can access this mega jail to see the [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=332.48s)]
*  current conditions, no media, no NGOs. What we know is that according to a [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=337.76000000000005s)]
*  recent report by one of the main NGOs, human rights NGOs in El Salvador, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=343.12s)]
*  Cristosal, we know that more than 150 people died in the whole country in [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=349.36s)]
*  different prisons of the whole country during this last year. Many of [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=356.64s)]
*  them because of torture, beatings, general violence against them and lack of [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=361.44s)]
*  medical treatment. So of course this is a huge concern for human rights [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=366.96s)]
*  organisations. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=371.15999999999997s)]
*  Okay Marcos thank you very much for talking to us. Thank you. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLWQO-RpHxw&t=372.15999999999997s)]
