Video Description: Pope Francis has been buried in Rome after a funeral ceremony and procession attended by hundreds of thousands of people and many heads of state.

The first South American pontiff passed away on Monday aged 88, marking the end of a 12-year pontificate.

Authorities said 140,000 had lined the streets, clapping and waving as the hearse – a repurposed white popemobile – crossed the Tiber river and drove past some of Rome's most recognisable sights.

Pope Francis was laid to rest at the Santa Maria Maggiore and buried in the righthand side of the church, near a beloved icon of the Virgin Mary.

*  But he wasn't going to be buried at st. Peter's like other popes [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=271.28s)]
*  It would instead be taken in a converted pope mobile to his favorite spot at a different basilica in the center of rome [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=274.71999999999997s)]

*  Oh [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=304.4s)]
*  So too did the clergy who'd participate in the final part of today's ceremonies [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=310.32s)]
*  Away from the gaze of the public the late pope was laid to rest [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=318.4s)]
*  In a tomb inscribed with just one word the latin version of his chosen name [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=323.12s)]
*  franciscus [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=329.65999999999997s)]
*  That reports by religion editor aleem magpul [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=334.47999999999996s)]
*  Well, andrea tonielli is the media editor for the holy sea. He told me what it was like to be at the pope's funeral [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=337.84s)]
*  I think that the funeral was a simple and beautiful ceremony [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=346.08s)]
*  The people of god the simple faithful took center stage [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=350.15999999999997s)]
*  400 000 people participated in the square and the street of rome only one week ago [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=354.7s)]
*  We have to remember the pope met for the last time the people in san peter square [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=360.88s)]
*  And yesterday people have returned this embrace [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=366.72s)]
*  yesterday was [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=370.56s)]
*  Touched by the presence of representatives of other religions faith [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=371.92s)]
*  And then I was struck by the meeting between president trump and president zelensky because france's cry for peace [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=376.72s)]
*  Was what characterized his pontificate to the very end? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=385.04s)]
*  The meeting between the two president was I think [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=389.36s)]
*  The last little miracle of of pope francis [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=392.8s)]
*  Indeed, it was a symbolic meeting [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=396.8s)]
*  How would you describe the mood among officials at the vatican about what comes next in terms of electing a new pope? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=399.44000000000005s)]
*  I [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=408.96000000000004s)]
*  I think that we have to wait and we have to wait the meeting between cardinals. So it's impossible [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=409.76000000000005s)]
*  To speak about this now [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=417.21999999999997s)]
*  But I want to underline the legacy of pope francis. I believe the most important legacy he lives [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=420.34s)]
*  Is the magisterium of mercy in these years during all his pontificate [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=427.06s)]
*  He has shown the face of a church with open doors which welcomes everyone [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=432.82s)]
*  He spoke about a church [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=438.74s)]
*  That is a [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=440.82s)]
*  Filed hospital and not a customs house [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=442.18s)]
*  He has shown tenderness and closeness toward all but especially towards the humble the last the poor the sinners [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=445.3s)]
*  People have understood this attitude and this teaching of the pope of mercy very well [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=453.78000000000003s)]
*  During the last world war youth day. He repeated that the church is a welcoming home for everyone everyone [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=459.54s)]
*  I think that this legacy it's important also for for the church now [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=467.14s)]
*  Yes, everyone is talking about his legacy in terms of spreading the message of mercy and he was incredibly popular as well [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=472.66s)]
*  Do you think that that's the natural direction for the church going forward now? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=481.3s)]
*  It's impossible to say now because the cardinal they have to discuss [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=486.42s)]
*  And in this period they have to discuss the future of the church [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=491.3s)]
*  but this process [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=496.34000000000003s)]
*  It will start [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=499.14s)]
*  Next monday with the congregation of cardinals. So [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=500.98s)]
*  They have to arrive all the electors in in rome and they have to discuss [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=506.26s)]
*  Andrea tuanielli there. Well, let's show you some pictures that have just come in [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69FW4rWUOpc&t=514.5s)]
