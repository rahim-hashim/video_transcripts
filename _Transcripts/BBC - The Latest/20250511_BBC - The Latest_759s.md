Video Description: Russian President Vladimir Putin has invited Ukraine to take part in "direct talks" on 15 May, hours after European leaders urged Moscow to agree to a 30-day ceasefire.
 
In a rare televised late-night address from the Kremlin, Putin said Russia was seeking "serious negotiations" aimed at "moving towards a lasting, strong peace".
 
On Saturday, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer travelled to Kyiv with other European leaders to put pressure on Russia to commit to an unconditional ceasefire, starting Monday.
 
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov later said Moscow would "have to think this through" - but warned that "trying to pressure us is quite useless".

# Putin calls for 'direct talks' with Ukraine as European leaders demand ceasefire | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A)
*  The Russian President Vladimir Putin has offered direct talks with Ukraine in the Turkish city of Istanbul next Thursday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=0.0s)]
*  At a late-night news conference, President Putin said that Moscow wanted serious negotiations to remove what he called the root causes of the conflict. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=7.44s)]
*  Mr Putin made the announcement after the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Poland, visiting Kiev on Saturday, called for a 30-day truce from Monday. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  Let's hear from more of what Mr Putin had to say. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=25.76s)]
*  We proposed to the Kiev authorities to resume the talks they stopped and terminated in April 2022. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=29.44s)]
*  I'm referring to direct talks without any preconditions and we propose to start immediately on next Thursday, on the 15th of May in Istanbul. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=41.52s)]
*  President Putin will tell us more about the press conference that took place at 2 o'clock Russian time, or Moscow time to be more precise. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=51.84s)]
*  Here's our Russia editor at BBC Monitoring, Vitaly Shevchenko. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=59.2s)]
*  It was a very, very unusual late-night statement by Vladimir Putin. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=63.760000000000005s)]
*  The media in Moscow were first told that he was about to make an important statement and they had to wait for more than an hour. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=69.84s)]
*  When he finally appeared, he started talking first about the string of meetings he had with various foreign leaders who visited Moscow for Victory Day on the 9th of May. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=79.6s)]
*  And then he got to the most important point in his statement that Moscow is proposing direct talks with Ukraine. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=93.28s)]
*  And he said that they need to start without delay as early as next Thursday, on the 15th of May in Istanbul. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=103.11999999999999s)]
*  Importantly, Vladimir Putin alluded to previous objections that Moscow voiced to the idea of a ceasefire in Ukraine. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=112.0s)]
*  He said that nobody needs a peace that leads to more conflict after Ukrainian forces receive more weapons from the West and more fighters. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=122.72s)]
*  So it looks like he's trying to pass the ball into Ukraine's court after a meeting of Ukrainian allies in Kiev earlier today, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=134.72s)]
*  who said that Russia must agree to a full and unconditional ceasefire on Monday, the 12th of May, or more sanctions would be imposed on Russia. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=146.95999999999998s)]
*  So it is possible that this kind of pressure is working and that Vladimir Putin is responding to it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=160.48s)]
*  Is he dragging his feet yet again? We don't know. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=168.72s)]
*  But the key takeaway from his statement is that Moscow is seeking talks with Ukraine. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=172.56s)]
*  And the message to people like Donald Trump would be that we are being constructive here. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=181.12s)]
*  We're being open here. Do not sanction us more. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=186.4s)]
*  Vitaly Shechenko there from BBC Monitoring. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=191.04s)]
*  So as we've been hearing, Mr Putin's comments come just hours after the leaders of Britain, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=193.68s)]
*  France, Germany and Poland visiting Kiev on Saturday called for a 30-day truce from Monday. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=198.56s)]
*  From there, our chief political correspondent Henry Zefman now reports. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=204.88s)]
*  Solidarity arriving on the sleeper train. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=213.12s)]
*  Sir Keir Starmer's second visit to Ukraine as Prime Minister but is first with company. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=215.6s)]
*  What now? First, solemnity. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=223.04s)]
*  These flags at Kiev's Independence Square commemorate Ukraine's war dead. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  Then a meeting of the Coalition of the Willing, the rest of its 30 or so members patched in by [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=230.88s)]
*  Videolink. Today they agreed on a specific demand. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=235.2s)]
*  Since Monday, 12th of May, a full and unconditional ceasefire must start for at least [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=241.44s)]
*  30 days. We together demanded from Russia. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=248.4s)]
*  In a week where we commemorated the end of a war in Europe, these European leaders have come here [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=251.6s)]
*  to Kiev to see a war in Europe. This is a deliberately symbolic visit. It's designed [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=257.28s)]
*  as a response to Putin and his posse of leaders in Moscow the day before. For Ukraine, these days [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=263.68s)]
*  bring clarity. Who's with them and who's against them? But who's America with? President Trump [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=270.48s)]
*  first suggested the 30-day plan. After the group meeting, President Macron got his phone out and [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=279.52s)]
*  dialed him up. Historical moments, the caption read. We haven't seen unity like this pretty well [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=284.15999999999997s)]
*  throughout the conflict. So to get the European allies, US, Canada, all on one page, you know, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=290.4s)]
*  Putin of course cannot be trusted, but this now is a unified call for an unconditional [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=302.64s)]
*  ceasefire backed up by sanctions. Unity, solidarity, willingness, none of these are in doubt. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=308.96s)]
*  But is it enough to justify these leaders' faith that they can change the course of this war? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=317.52s)]
*  Henry Zefferman, BBC News, Kiev. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=323.52s)]
*  Asked, Kirti correspondent Frank Gardner has more. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=326.48s)]
*  The response as we've seen to yesterday's call for a full 30-day ceasefire by Ukraine and its [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=331.28s)]
*  allies is this extraordinary late night conference, our late night press conference that President [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=338.56s)]
*  Putin called in Moscow, where he said, I want direct talks with Ukraine on Thursday. So [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=345.52s)]
*  the Kremlin is very good at muddying the waters like this because they have not agreed to this [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=352.64s)]
*  30-day ceasefire that everyone here was demanding. And instead, President Putin said, let's address [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=358.08s)]
*  the root causes of this conflict. Now, Russia's idea of the root causes of this conflict are very [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=364.08s)]
*  different from the West's idea of the root causes. Putin sees the problem as Ukraine being lured into [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=369.52s)]
*  the West. He doesn't want Ukraine joining the EU or NATO or looking westwards. He wants it back in [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=376.8s)]
*  Moscow's sphere of influence in the way that Belarus is and that he would like other countries [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=385.52000000000004s)]
*  to be that used to be former members of the Soviet Union. So I'm not optimistic that that is going [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=391.04s)]
*  to work. But President Putin has pointed out that there were direct talks back in 2022, soon after [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=398.08000000000004s)]
*  the full-scale invasion in Istanbul between Ukraine and Russia. And he says the West made Ukraine [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=406.08s)]
*  walk away from those talks. There is an element of truth in that. But so much has changed since then. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=412.96s)]
*  And this country, Ukraine, has come under absolute vicious bombardment day in, day out. So many [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=419.91999999999996s)]
*  people have been killed, as they have on the Russian side of the front lines, too. And Ukraine [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=427.12s)]
*  has developed its own very effective drone industry where it's able to do long-range strikes deep [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=431.52s)]
*  into Russia. It's even been able to get its drones to penetrate Moscow's air defences. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=437.68s)]
*  So a lot's moved on. And I think the gap between the two sides, Russia and Ukraine, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=443.12s)]
*  is as wide as ever. There is no common ground. What do you make of this? At a time of the [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=447.68s)]
*  softening, apparent softening of the US position, it appears that the coalition of the willing, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=454.24s)]
*  as it's called, within Europe has tightened and strengthened. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=460.16s)]
*  Yes. Yesterday was partly symbolic that you got the first time four leaders of major European [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=467.76000000000005s)]
*  countries all arrived here at the same time in Kiev to show their support the day after Moscow's [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=473.76000000000005s)]
*  victory parade, which, by the way, I agree with you. I think it was a success for President Putin, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=479.28000000000003s)]
*  that parade. He's not as isolated as the West would like. The West may not like some of the [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=484.24s)]
*  nations, some of the policies of people who were there, people like Maduro of Venezuela. But [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=490.56s)]
*  nevertheless, he's not isolated. So the pressure is on diplomatically. President Putin knows he's [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=495.52s)]
*  got to respond. He has responded with his counteroffer. But I think once people wake up [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=502.88s)]
*  here in Ukraine, it's still pretty early and it's a Sunday, obviously, once we get full responses, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=509.04s)]
*  I'm pretty sure Ukraine is going to dismiss Russia's reaction to this, saying, no, look, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=515.12s)]
*  you've been given a clear choice here. Sign up to a full 30-day comprehensive ceasefire tomorrow, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=520.64s)]
*  Monday, starting then on land and sea and air. If you don't, you face bigger sanctions. Now, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=528.4s)]
*  there's no question that countries like the UK and France would like to impose those tougher sanctions [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=535.2s)]
*  and increase military aid to Ukraine. The big unknown is what's going on inside Donald Trump's [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=540.5600000000001s)]
*  head, because, as you heard from your previous, from Professor Fish there, Donald Trump likes [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=546.32s)]
*  Putin. They have a they've got a history going back. He wants to do business with Putin. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=551.9200000000001s)]
*  President Trump wants to get U.S. businesses back into Russia. He wants a deal. And so who knows [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=557.44s)]
*  which way it's going to go? Is he going to get tough? Is he going to deliver on his earlier [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=564.24s)]
*  threat of secondary sanctions, of punishing countries that buy Russian oil, important [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=568.72s)]
*  countries like China and India? Or is he going to have more direct talks, send Steve Witkoff off to [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=574.08s)]
*  Moscow or St. Petersburg again, to be embraced literally with open arms by Vladimir Putin [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=580.48s)]
*  and cut a deal over the heads of Ukraine and its European allies? That's the big unknown here. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=586.88s)]
*  Frank Gardner there. Steve Fish is a professor of political science at the University of California, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=593.44s)]
*  Berkeley and author of Democracy Derailed in Russia, the Failure of Open Politics. He gave me his [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=598.8000000000001s)]
*  take on why President Putin had suddenly called for these talks with Ukraine. Well, Putin is now [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=605.12s)]
*  been set back on his heels. Putin always assumed that Europe didn't have real leaders and that [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=611.6s)]
*  Europeans weren't willing to sacrifice anything for Ukraine. He's now seeing that that might not be [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=616.32s)]
*  true. Europe is actually proving so far to actually have leaders, four leaders plus Zelensky, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=621.92s)]
*  who are willing to step up and stand up to Putin. This is something Putin wasn't anticipating. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=628.4799999999999s)]
*  And they seem willing even to basically fill the gap that the United States has created by [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=634.0s)]
*  withdrawing as strong a support from Ukraine as it had under the Biden administration. This is [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=639.04s)]
*  what Putin is worried about. Putin is also a little bit worried that maybe his control over Trump is [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=644.16s)]
*  less complete than it used to be. We have to remember that Trump is Putin's boy. He has been [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=649.84s)]
*  all the way back to 2016. Trump thinks that Putin helped him get elected, which he did to begin with. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=655.12s)]
*  He wants what Putin has. He admires Putin. But recently, Trump has discovered that he can make [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=660.8s)]
*  as much money as he wants from his time in office out of cryptocurrency schemes and things like that. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=666.96s)]
*  And it might be coming clear to Trump now he doesn't need Putin for an additional several [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=674.16s)]
*  billion. He doesn't need Putin's support. You might see himself now as bigger than Putin. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=678.72s)]
*  Oddly enough, although that's a strange way to get here, this might actually soften the [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=683.6s)]
*  unequivocality of Trump's support for Putin. And Putin senses that as well. That's what's going on [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=688.64s)]
*  here. Right. But if you look to the last few days in Victory Day and the parade that we saw in Russia [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=694.0s)]
*  and Moscow, it doesn't look as if President Putin is particularly isolated on the world stage, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=701.28s)]
*  much less so, for example, than he was two or three years ago. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=707.04s)]
*  Well, the main difference is that Trump is in office and Trump sides with Putin. That's the [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=711.68s)]
*  main difference. When it comes to isolation among other powers, what we've seen actually is Europe [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=715.92s)]
*  again really stand up. We've seen East Asian democracies, Japan, stand up. Japan is now saying [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=721.4399999999999s)]
*  that it's going to share intelligence with Ukraine. We've seen most of the world's rich, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=728.8s)]
*  leading democracies siding unequivocally with Ukraine and reinforcing their support for Ukraine [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=734.0s)]
*  now that American support seems to have softened under Trump. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgDHevAc8A&t=739.92s)]
