Video Description: Researchers in the US have begun building a new particle detector that they hope will help find an answer to why our Universe exists. 
 
The project is known as the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) and will study subatomic particles. 
The researchers in the US are in a race for the answer with a separate team of Japanese scientists â€“ who are several years ahead.
 
The current theory of how the Universe came into being can't explain the existence of the planets, stars and galaxies we see around us. 
 
The US-led international collaboration is hoping the answer lies deep underground. The scientists will travel 1,500 metres below the surface into three vast underground caverns.

# Scientists race to discover why our Universe exists | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L25UVsxuMUg)
*  Researchers in the US have begun building a new particle detector that they hope will help find [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L25UVsxuMUg&t=0.0s)]
*  an answer to a very big question. Just why does the universe exist? The project is known as the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L25UVsxuMUg&t=4.32s)]
*  Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment or DUNE for short and will study subatomic particles. Let's [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L25UVsxuMUg&t=10.32s)]
*  speak to Dr Mark Scott, Senior Lecturer in Neutrino Physics at Imperial College London. Dr Scott, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L25UVsxuMUg&t=16.88s)]
*  thank you very much for joining us. We've got two projects that we need to talk about, one American, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L25UVsxuMUg&t=23.84s)]
*  one Japanese. Let's start with how the science works behind what you're trying to discover in [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L25UVsxuMUg&t=28.48s)]
*  words of one or two syllables if you can. I'll try my best, thank you. So yeah, we're studying [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L25UVsxuMUg&t=35.84s)]
*  a fundamental particle known as a neutrino and it comes in three different types, things we call [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L25UVsxuMUg&t=43.2s)]
*  flavors. So we have electron, muon and tau type neutrinos. Now these experiments, the one in the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L25UVsxuMUg&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  US and Hyper-K, the one I work on in Japan, we create very powerful beams of neutrinos and fire [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L25UVsxuMUg&t=57.52s)]
*  them hundreds of kilometers. And when we create these beams as they travel, the neutrinos change [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L25UVsxuMUg&t=64.56s)]
*  between these three different types. So a muon neutrino may change into an electron neutrino, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L25UVsxuMUg&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  for instance. And what the experiments are looking for is very subtle differences between how matter [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L25UVsxuMUg&t=76.08s)]
*  neutrinos change compared to antimatter neutrinos. And if we see that these are different, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L25UVsxuMUg&t=83.52s)]
*  it might tell us why the universe we live in appears to be dominated by matter rather than [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L25UVsxuMUg&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  antimatter. Why does it have to be so far underground? We're seeing pictures of the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L25UVsxuMUg&t=95.36s)]
*  tunneling that's had to go on to enable this to happen. So the detectors are very, very sensitive. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L25UVsxuMUg&t=100.96s)]
*  They're looking for extremely rare and extremely low energy events. And the Earth is surrounded by [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L25UVsxuMUg&t=107.68s)]
*  an atmosphere and it's continually bombarded with particles, mainly from the sun but also from [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L25UVsxuMUg&t=115.44000000000001s)]
*  elsewhere in our solar system. These particles are raining down on us on the surface of the planet. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L25UVsxuMUg&t=121.2s)]
*  And so if we built our detectors on the surface, they would just be swamped by this background. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L25UVsxuMUg&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  We call them cosmic rays. So we dig them underground and put usually a mountain on [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L25UVsxuMUg&t=133.20000000000002s)]
*  top if we can to shield ourselves from this. How is it then that the Japanese-led Hyper-K [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L25UVsxuMUg&t=138.48000000000002s)]
*  project is ahead of the American Dune project? Yeah, this is an interesting question. So the two [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L25UVsxuMUg&t=145.28s)]
*  collaborations made decisions early on in the design of their experiments. And the Japanese [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L25UVsxuMUg&t=152.56s)]
*  group, Hyper-K, chose to use water detectors as their technology, whereas the US-led group Dune [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L25UVsxuMUg&t=159.92s)]
*  uses liquid argon. So liquid argon is very nice. It gives you a very detailed look at what's happening [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L25UVsxuMUg&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  in your experiment. But it's very hard to get a large volume of liquid argon. And so they had to [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L25UVsxuMUg&t=174.56s)]
*  do a lot more development of their detector, whereas the water technology used in Japan [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L25UVsxuMUg&t=181.67999999999998s)]
*  was well understood. And it's much easier to make a larger detector. So the design for Hyper-K has, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L25UVsxuMUg&t=187.52s)]
*  I think, 225,000 tons of water, whereas the design for Dune has 40,000 tons of liquid argon. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L25UVsxuMUg&t=195.68s)]
*  So roughly five, five and a half times bigger. They don't call it a space race for nothing, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L25UVsxuMUg&t=204.0s)]
*  I suppose. And it's an apt description on this occasion. Dr. Mark Scott from Imperial College [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L25UVsxuMUg&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  London, thank you very much for taking us gently through the science. Thank you. Thank you. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L25UVsxuMUg&t=215.68s)]
