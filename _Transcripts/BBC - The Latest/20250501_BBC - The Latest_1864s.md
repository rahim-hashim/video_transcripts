# Is the US minerals deal a win for Ukraine? Your questions answered | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE)
*  Hello and welcome to a special edition of Ukrainecast which is being broadcast both [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=0.0s)]
*  on the BBC News live page and also on the BBC iPlayer. Welcome. I'm Lucy Hawkins. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=5.88s)]
*  I'm Ukraine correspondent James Waterhouse. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=12.0s)]
*  I'm Olga Robinson at BBC Verify. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=14.72s)]
*  And I'm James Landau, the BBC's diplomatic correspondent. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=16.8s)]
*  Lots to discuss today and so many of your questions that we're going to try and get [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=24.12s)]
*  into. But of course, overnight we learnt that Ukraine and the US signed a much anticipated [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=27.52s)]
*  natural resources deal. You'll know there was months of tense negotiations and all of [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=32.84s)]
*  our listeners on Ukrainecast have been asking us lots of questions about this development. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  And what a lot of you want to know is whether or not this actually brings us any closer [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=43.8s)]
*  to peace. Well, we're going to try and answer lots of your questions today. So why don't [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=49.16s)]
*  we get straight into the first one. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  This is Dudley in London. My question is, why is Ukraine going ahead with the minerals [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=56.0s)]
*  deal? As the US is siding with Russia, it appears that Ukraine has nothing to lose by [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=61.68s)]
*  refusing to give away its assets. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=67.2s)]
*  James Waterhouse, why is Ukraine going ahead with this deal? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=69.72s)]
*  Well, Ukraine would argue that it's got everything to gain. This was an idea first pitched by [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=72.64s)]
*  President Zelensky towards the end of last year in his victory plan. He was under pressure [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=78.12s)]
*  from Western allies to articulate his vision for how peace could be achieved. And he said, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=83.39999999999999s)]
*  look, we are we possess five percent of the world's critical minerals. We need investment. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=89.32s)]
*  We need your cash to come and extract it. It's worth hundreds of billions of dollars. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=96.24s)]
*  If you come and invest in us, that will mean investing in our future. If we could just [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=100.96s)]
*  get in return some concrete security guarantees that you would be there in case Russia invaded [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=104.91999999999999s)]
*  in the future, that'd be great. Let's do business. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=110.24s)]
*  Donald Trump's ears perked up at that very suggestion, not least because he's waging [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=112.67999999999999s)]
*  a trade war with China at the moment. And China has control of the majority of the world's [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=117.56s)]
*  critical minerals, it is thought. But in the time since, we've had that Oval Office [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=123.96s)]
*  row where it was going to be signed, then it wasn't. This deal has evolved into being [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=129.84s)]
*  far more wide ranging, including coal, gas, energy projects. And here we are now where [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=134.46s)]
*  it seems Ukraine has got itself a deal it's happy with. It is a deal that recognises Russia [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=143.46s)]
*  as the invader. It paves the way for future military aid. And it sets in action a long [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=149.22s)]
*  term investment by America, which effectively ties it to the country. And Ukraine will hope [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=156.58s)]
*  it'll be enough for America to stand with Ukraine for once against Russia. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=161.78s)]
*  James Landau, that's what a lot of our listeners really want to know, what James has just alluded [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=167.02s)]
*  to. Is this a win for Ukraine? Is this a good deal for Ukraine? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=171.1s)]
*  Well they seem pretty happy with it. I mean, my view is that it is a win, simply because [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=175.94s)]
*  a lot of the slightly more negative stuff which we have been reporting on in recent [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=180.57999999999998s)]
*  weeks and months seems to have been taken out of it. Because if you remember some of [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=185.85999999999999s)]
*  the texts and versions and leaks and nudges that we've seen about this suggested, for [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=189.26s)]
*  example, that this deal ultimately would be about the United States effectively extorting [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=193.89999999999998s)]
*  Ukraine's natural resources to pay off the debt of the US military and financial contribution [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=200.45999999999998s)]
*  to Ukraine since February 22. That seems to have gone now. What we're talking about is [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=206.62s)]
*  any future investment by the United States in terms of military support or financial [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=213.82s)]
*  support, that will now in future be in the sort of the US credit, the US capital investment [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=218.58s)]
*  side of this particular deal. But we're talking about the future, not the past. So we're not [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=225.06s)]
*  talking about paying off debts. There was a lot of detail in the past saying that the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=228.82000000000002s)]
*  Americans would have huge control over the board that was going to run this fund. There [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=233.86s)]
*  were problems with would this deal prevent Ukraine joining the EU? That seems to have gone away. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=237.94s)]
*  So in pure sort of economic financial terms, it seems to be a much better deal. But obviously, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=244.26s)]
*  there are all the diplomatic consequences and benefits to that follow from it. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=249.38s)]
*  We'll get to those in a moment. But Olga, can we just clarify about the money? Because President [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=254.01999999999998s)]
*  Trump said Biden handed them $350 billion. We've made a deal we can get much more in theory than [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=259.06s)]
*  that. Is that accurate what he's saying there, Olga? So the number $350 billion in aid for Ukraine, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=265.94s)]
*  is interesting. We've looked into it previously. And we have found no evidence to back up the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=273.94s)]
*  claim that the US has given $350 billion or even $300 billion worth of aid to Ukraine. There are [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=279.3s)]
*  different calculations out there. But the ones that we've been able to find are much, much lower. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=285.7s)]
*  For example, Akil Institute, which is a German based think tank that tracks US aid for Ukraine, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=292.98s)]
*  that puts the number at $119 billion between January 22 and December 24. And the US Department [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=298.82s)]
*  of Defense gives a bigger number, but it is still $182 billion, nowhere near $300 billion. And these [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=307.14s)]
*  are funds that are appropriated as part of its response for the invasion. But that covers [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=317.3s)]
*  training in Europe and replenishment of US defense stocks, which is much wider than just [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=323.14s)]
*  pure support, military support for Ukraine. And James, can we just clarify James Waterhouse? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=328.82s)]
*  We call it a mineral steel, but it is actually much bigger than that. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=334.58s)]
*  It's become way much bigger than that now, isn't it? We're talking about coal, oil, gas, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=337.7s)]
*  and critical minerals. We're talking about zinc, copper, lithium, uranium. It's the whole shebang, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=345.46s)]
*  if you like. And it's thought that Ukraine can only extract at the moment a fraction of what it [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=353.46s)]
*  possesses, but we should not get carried away just because this agreement is signed. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=360.09999999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump is not suddenly going to be presenting his voters with a check saying, look, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=365.06s)]
*  we're getting the first bit of cash coming in from this scheme. We've spoken to companies in [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=369.78s)]
*  Kiev and they say, look, it takes decades, a minimum of 20 years to work out where these [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=375.29999999999995s)]
*  materials are. Then you've got to excavate. It takes a lot of time. And I think Ukraine will be [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=380.58s)]
*  keeping an eye on American military aid in the future, perhaps arriving earlier than in 20 years [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=386.34s)]
*  time. But clearly, I think this is a political coup for Donald Trump as well. He's showing that [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=392.02s)]
*  there is a sustainable, as he sees it, business model here in investing in the future of Ukraine. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=396.26s)]
*  James, I think there was an intake of breath from all of us that follow closely what's happening in [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=402.02s)]
*  Ukraine when we saw in that corner of St Peter's Basilica, Donald Trump leaning in to President [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=406.42s)]
*  Zelensky. Their eyes were locked, but given the bad blood we've seen between them, it seemed like [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=413.38s)]
*  quite a nice moment, intense moment between them. Was that moment in the Vatican, do you think, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=419.06s)]
*  potentially the turning point? Look, we'll never know until both sides give a very detailed account [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=424.58000000000004s)]
*  of precisely who said what to whom there and the moment, but that's the only they know that. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=430.26s)]
*  Look, clearly, we do know that Donald Trump is quite responsive to the most recent person he [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=435.22s)]
*  spoke to. We have seen that, that occasionally his words echo recent meetings. And if at that point, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=442.42s)]
*  President Zelensky managed to sort of get into the president, President Trump's head, that this is [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=453.86s)]
*  something he can get a win here. Because if you think about it, Donald Trump is looking for wins [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=459.62s)]
*  across the entire diplomatic field at the moment, whether it is Gaza, whether it is Iran, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=464.34s)]
*  whether it is tariffs. And on Ukraine, it's his 100th day week. He wants something to point to. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=468.5s)]
*  If this deal is signed, as it has been, that gives him something to point to. Because he can now say [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=476.26s)]
*  to the American people, look, when we start giving future aid and military support to Ukraine, right, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=480.9s)]
*  we're going to get some payback. It might take many, many years, but he can make that argument [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=488.34s)]
*  in a way that he hasn't been able to before. And I think therefore, maybe that moment in [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=492.98s)]
*  the Vatican was just part of that turning point, where it wasn't just about the minerals deal. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=498.74s)]
*  They were also talking about just how you put more pressure on Russia to respond more positively in [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=503.86s)]
*  the wider peace talks. And Olga, have we had any official reaction yet from the Kremlin to the deal? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=511.70000000000005s)]
*  We haven't had yet any official reaction from the Kremlin. But we have had reactions from some senior [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=517.3000000000001s)]
*  Russian officials like former Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, who's quite close to President [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=523.0600000000001s)]
*  Putin. And he used this as an opportunity to again criticize Ukraine and present the deal as [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=529.38s)]
*  not being that beneficial to Ukraine. Because, and I will quote him here, he suggested that [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=535.38s)]
*  Washington has finally broken Kiev into paying for aid. And then similar reaction has been coming [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=541.38s)]
*  from some of the very well known Russian TV presenters like Olga Skabeva, who's really well [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=547.94s)]
*  known in Russia. And she said, well, a fair amount of natural resources actually are controlled by [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=554.34s)]
*  Russia, because it's an occupied territory. So Zelensky kind of sold Trump a cat in the back. So [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=560.82s)]
*  they allegedly don't even know how much they can actually, you know, mine and extract. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=568.34s)]
*  And that's a fair comment, isn't it, James? It's so difficult. Is it fair to know what is actually [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=574.74s)]
*  there? What access the US will actually have to what is there? I mean, Medvedev says a lot of [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=581.38s)]
*  things in this war, but I think it is fair to say that Russia does occupy a sizeable chunk of what [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=587.06s)]
*  we're talking about here, notably coal mines, if you're talking about eastern Ukraine, and [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=592.42s)]
*  they simply won't feed into this deal. But on the Russia question, do you not think, I just wonder [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=598.5799999999999s)]
*  whether if we talk about this diplomatic triangle, we've got Ukraine trying to show America it's [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=604.18s)]
*  willing for peace, and America saying we're running out of patience with Russia. Is this the week when [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=609.3s)]
*  actually America has run out of patience with Russia for now? Donald Trump has used warming [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=614.74s)]
*  language to the Kremlin. He hasn't got the return in action that he would have liked. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=620.8199999999999s)]
*  He's not impressed by these short last minute ceasefires being announced by Moscow. And I just [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=625.9399999999999s)]
*  wonder whether for now there is a realignment going on here. And this energy agreement is just [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=631.78s)]
*  a part of that. I'm just curious to see how this might play out. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=638.66s)]
*  Your thoughts on that, James? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=642.5s)]
*  I'm conscious of the fact that the US position can turn on a sixpence day to day, hour by hour. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=644.9s)]
*  So I'm mindful of that. But I think what is true is the fact that this is now a document in card [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=652.5799999999999s)]
*  cold print that A, blames Russia for its full scale invasion. It uses that phrase. We have Scott [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=658.1s)]
*  Besson talking about long term support for a free, prosperous, sovereign Ukraine. Again, not words [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=664.1800000000001s)]
*  you hear often from an American spokesman, let alone the president. So I think certainly this deal, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=670.26s)]
*  this minerals infrastructure energy deal, raises the bar for the Americans washing their hands [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=675.78s)]
*  of this whole peace process as they have threatened to do in recent days and weeks. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=683.46s)]
*  And James, what has the reaction been to the deal amongst people in Ukraine? Not officials, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=688.34s)]
*  but other people. And did they feel this starts to bring them a bit closer to peace? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=693.94s)]
*  I think when you spoke to Ukrainians after that Oval Office row, there was an initial pride, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=698.1800000000001s)]
*  because whenever a Ukraine is attacked politically or otherwise, there was this kind of unity that [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=704.02s)]
*  follows. And Zelensky's approval rating spiked, but it was symptomatic of what Ukraine was going [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=708.1s)]
*  through. But then came this secondary wave of an acceptance that Ukraine will always need America, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=714.26s)]
*  if it is to have any kind of chance to sustain its fight. There's no longer talk about repelling [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=721.3000000000001s)]
*  Russia militarily. But if you look at what MPs are saying, obviously, I'm here with you at the [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=727.3000000000001s)]
*  moment. I haven't had any immediate reaction. But it is that this deal seems fair. And all of the [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=732.66s)]
*  talks behind the scenes when you're in the presidential palace or wherever in Kiev, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=740.1s)]
*  they said this has to be 50-50. We're not just going to go into this. And James saw previous [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=744.66s)]
*  versions of this, where America would have had complete control, power of veto over future [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=751.86s)]
*  energy projects. When Zelensky was articulating his red lines, that not a cent will be [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=757.46s)]
*  seen as a paying back of a debt, that it would have to be 50-50, otherwise we won't sign it. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=764.5s)]
*  I thought, good luck holding onto those red lines if you're going to engage him, not least with all [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=770.1s)]
*  the pressure he was getting from European allies. And yet, yes, we don't have concrete security [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=774.6600000000001s)]
*  guarantees, but those red lines have held. And there is now a signed document articulating [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=779.94s)]
*  America's commitment to Ukraine. James Landau, we're getting lots of questions [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=788.0999999999999s)]
*  in from listeners and from viewers as well. This one coming in from Luke. And actually, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=791.78s)]
*  we've seen a few like this asking about NATO. Will this deal still allow Ukraine to join NATO [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=796.5799999999999s)]
*  in due time? I don't think this deal has any bearing at all on whether or not Ukraine will [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=802.42s)]
*  or will not join NATO in the future. At the moment, the general consensus is that that is a very, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=808.66s)]
*  very distant prospect. Even if you talk privately to Ukrainian politicians, they concede that that [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=815.62s)]
*  is not something that they are going to insist upon as a red line under any kind of peace deal, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=822.58s)]
*  because they know it's just one of those things that is almost... Because the point is that it's [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=827.94s)]
*  not as if NATO is rushing itself to introduce Ukraine into NATO as an alliance. So this is not [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=836.74s)]
*  something that's just... There are so many problems with this. So I think this deal, as agreed, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=843.86s)]
*  doesn't actually affect the fact that I think most people think that Ukraine and NATO membership is [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=850.9s)]
*  a very, very distant prospect at the moment. I'm also looking at some of the questions we're [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=855.94s)]
*  getting in from those that are following us on the BBC News live page at the moment. Thank you so [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=859.62s)]
*  much for getting in contact. And I'm just going to pick this one because there's a few of you [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=864.1s)]
*  reflecting on this concern. Is this really such a great deal for Ukraine if there are no security [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=868.74s)]
*  guarantees and the US can walk away at any time? If I was Putin, I'd promise Trump the same or [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=874.58s)]
*  better terms on a resources deal for all of Ukraine's resources when Russia have won the war. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=880.1s)]
*  The key thing to remember here is that, yes, Ukraine, when it began this whole process, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=885.3s)]
*  when Trump started the whole process of trying to find a peace deal, Ukraine's demand was, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=890.42s)]
*  we're not going to agree to anything unless we get a promise of security guarantees. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=895.7s)]
*  But then there was that row in the Oval Office. And then after that, Ukraine said, right, we are [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=899.86s)]
*  prepared to make a concession. We are going to drop our demand for there having to be a US security [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=904.9000000000001s)]
*  guarantee attached to anything. We will accept Donald Trump's demand for an unconditional ceasefire [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=911.22s)]
*  and then followed by long-term talks. That was the big concession the Ukrainians made. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=916.58s)]
*  That meant that for a brief period, the Americans and the Ukrainians were on the same page. Then [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=922.1800000000001s)]
*  the Russians then said, well, no, here's our long list of preconditions. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=925.54s)]
*  To that extent, the Ukrainians have already accepted that their demand for explicit US [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=930.5799999999999s)]
*  security guarantees are slightly separate. They're not going to insist on them. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=936.98s)]
*  So in this minerals infrastructure energy deal, the security guarantee is not explicit. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=942.3399999999999s)]
*  It is not a promise. It is implicit. In other words, the idea that America invests in this [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=948.66s)]
*  country for the long term, the fact that you have American companies, American workers, American [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=955.86s)]
*  assets, capital on the ground, the theory is that might deter some future Russian aggression. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=960.8199999999999s)]
*  The key point is that there has been American investment in Ukraine before, and it didn't stop [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=969.14s)]
*  the previous investment. But that is the argument now that if America goes in hard with a lot of [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=974.1s)]
*  American assets on the ground, then that would make potentially a future calculation by Putin [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=979.7s)]
*  to go in again. It would be a factor in his calculation. We have lots of very lovely, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=986.4200000000001s)]
*  committed and loyal listeners to Ukrainecast from right around the world. We have a newbie [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=993.22s)]
*  to the podcast, a new listener, Susie, who joins us now from Boston. Welcome to the Ukrainecast [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=998.26s)]
*  family, Susie. And you have a question for us. Yes, thank you so much for having me. I'm a big fan [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1003.7s)]
*  of Ukrainecast and I'm delighted to be here. I wanted to ask about the American negotiation [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1009.3000000000001s)]
*  tactics to secure peace. So Trump has previously appeared to make concessions to Russia. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1015.46s)]
*  So my question is this, could an economic relationship with the US in and of itself be [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1021.5400000000001s)]
*  used as a bargaining chip to incentivize Putin to accept a peace deal? Could the Trump administration [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1028.42s)]
*  promise to return American businesses, tourism, remove sanctions on Russia in exchange for peace [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1034.5800000000002s)]
*  and security in Ukraine? In other words, is Trump giving away valuable leverage for free? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1042.02s)]
*  Olga, what would you say? Well, the thing is, the Russians are already talking to Steve Wittkopf, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1048.74s)]
*  who's a former property developer. So he's talking about to Putin about investment, about projects [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1054.58s)]
*  that could be, you know, there's been talk about Trump Tower, possibly somewhere in Russia. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1065.54s)]
*  And these negotiations seem to be almost like they don't actually mention Ukraine very much when [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1071.62s)]
*  you read the summaries of what they've been talking about. So it's almost like the Russians [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1077.9399999999998s)]
*  are trying to move the conversation with the US away from Ukraine and more into the kind of [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1082.1s)]
*  transactional sphere of talking about the prospects of better diplomatic or economic relations and [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1088.8999999999999s)]
*  kind of massively away from Ukraine and a peace deal. You're nodding along to that, James, did [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1099.3s)]
*  you want to add something? What's clear is that why is Russia starting to react to Donald Trump's [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1105.2199999999998s)]
*  threats to walk away from this peace endeavor? Well, there's still something in it for Moscow. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1112.82s)]
*  Olga, you've just said, you know, the economic partnerships being discussed at quite a senior [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1117.2199999999998s)]
*  level between the US and Russia, but also it wants to negotiate a relaxation of sanctions. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1122.58s)]
*  I don't think it feeds into this deal that's been agreed between Ukraine and the US. But I do agree [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1127.2199999999998s)]
*  that Russia is going to look to bridge Europe and Ukraine and pursue its own interests with the US [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1134.58s)]
*  whilst trying to demonstrate that it too is up for peace and being the solution to its own full [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1141.54s)]
*  scale invasion. But as of now, I think what is interesting is that these two short ceasefires [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1147.54s)]
*  announced by Russia haven't really made a dent and it'll be a blow to the Kremlin that this deal has [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1154.26s)]
*  now been been agreed between Kiev and Washington directly. Susie, did you have anything you wanted [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1159.94s)]
*  to follow up with? Yeah, thank you. Regarding the minerals deal, the US indicates that this deal [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1166.02s)]
*  would not prevent Ukraine from seeking EU membership and resources deals with Brussels. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1172.58s)]
*  What do we make of that detail? I think, again, it's another win for the Ukrainians because in [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1178.34s)]
*  earlier drafts, there were provisions that would have made EU membership very, very hard for Ukraine [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1186.74s)]
*  simply because the earlier drafts suggested that whenever there was any kind of investment [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1193.38s)]
*  opportunity, Ukraine would be obliged to give first refusal to American investors. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1200.74s)]
*  And that's not something that is allowed if you are a member of the European Union because you [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1206.66s)]
*  have to act collectively and you can't have favorable deals with outside countries. You have [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1210.9s)]
*  to operate on a trading basis. You have to operate as a group. So to that extent, I think, again, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1215.7s)]
*  it's a win for Ukraine. And again, it just shows that actually the idea of Ukraine in the future, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1221.7s)]
*  if there is peace, being able to choose its own alliances with external partners is a key [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1229.8600000000001s)]
*  Ukrainian demand because to them, that is a demonstration of sovereignty. Sovereignty [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1237.94s)]
*  means you can have an army the size you want it. You can do whatever deals with whichever parties [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1242.9s)]
*  and other alliances that you choose that you're not told to do it by another power. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1247.94s)]
*  Suzy, thanks so much for joining us. Thanks for listening. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1253.06s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1256.98s)]
*  And for your great questions. And I've got this one to bring in from two of our live page listeners, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1258.18s)]
*  Carla and Jeff. You're obviously following along together and have come up with this question. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1263.78s)]
*  Thank you so much for it. Does the deal include any reference to the coalition of the willing [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1267.46s)]
*  initiative, these European countries and others deploying to Ukraine to ensure the deal is enacted [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1272.5s)]
*  fairly and to ensure security at any future borders? James Waterhouse. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1277.46s)]
*  I haven't seen any reference to the coalition of the willing. This is a little bit of an opaque, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1281.78s)]
*  thorny issue. This seems to be a mostly commercial venture, albeit with the prospect of future [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1288.58s)]
*  American military aid being delivered once more. As for the so-called coalition of the willing, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1297.94s)]
*  we are still lacking serious specifics as to how that could be played out in practice. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1304.42s)]
*  The initial blueprint suggested that notably UK and French troops would lead the way in a training [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1311.1399999999999s)]
*  capacity in Western Ukraine, helping Ukrainian forces as they make their way to the eastern [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1317.06s)]
*  and southern front lines. But the jarring point still is scale, because we are talking about [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1324.18s)]
*  a war with hundreds of thousands of troops on both sides continuing to fight along a front line, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1331.7s)]
*  almost 1,000 kilometres long. European allies can't even get close to not just providing troops to [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1337.1399999999999s)]
*  that level, but sustaining it. You've had Ukraine asking America for security guarantees. Will you [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1344.02s)]
*  be there just in case? Europe is asking for it as well. They are intertwined in that if America has [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1351.1399999999999s)]
*  more of a reason to care about Eastern Europe and Ukraine and these long-term investments, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1357.7s)]
*  then just maybe they'll stick around to maybe nudge along this coalition of the willing and [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1364.9s)]
*  help them act it out in practice. But so far, we've seen little to no appetite from Washington to [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1370.1000000000001s)]
*  put their own boots on the ground. OK, let's hear now from a Ukrainecast listener, Andrew Lloyd [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1375.22s)]
*  in Eastbourne. Hi, Ukrainecast. This is Andrew Lloyd in Eastbourne. My question is this. Let's [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1379.94s)]
*  say President Trump gets his ceasefire and both sides agree the territorial exchange is envisaged. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1387.14s)]
*  Would the fighting actually stop? Would it not just move to a different phase with both sides [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1393.8600000000001s)]
*  engaging in cross-border incursions, guerrilla tactics, car bombings, possibly full-on exchanges? [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1398.8200000000002s)]
*  True peace feels very far away and yet President Trump and his team don't seem to want to grasp [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1405.46s)]
*  that at all. Olga, it obviously depends on what the ceasefire deal, if there is one, contains. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1411.38s)]
*  Exactly. But can you answer that question? Would the fighting stop? [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1417.46s)]
*  I mean, it's really hard to predict what is going to happen. And like you say, a lot will depend on [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1421.7s)]
*  what the deal really is and what the conditions of it are. But so far, if history is anything to go [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1428.1799999999998s)]
*  by, ceasefires have a long history of both sides accusing each other of violating it immediately. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1435.3799999999999s)]
*  Like the Easter ceasefire that we saw, both sides were talking about thousands of violations [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1442.4199999999998s)]
*  together. And obviously, we can never preclude the possibility of there being incursions or [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1451.14s)]
*  skirmishes and fighting happening somewhere along the kind of frozen front line. We've seen that [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1458.9s)]
*  before happen before even the full scale invasion. I think what is important, like in my head, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1464.66s)]
*  important to understand that Russia has laid claim to four regions in Ukraine. He doesn't control [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1471.8600000000001s)]
*  fully those regions like in in Donetsk and Zaporizhzhya. It's like 60, 70 percent of the [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1479.14s)]
*  territory that is controlled by Russia only. So potentially nothing really if the front line [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1485.5400000000002s)]
*  is frozen along the lines that is roughly now, nothing really stops Russia from using the fact [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1494.0200000000002s)]
*  that those regions are in their constitution to then come back and use the constitution, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1500.66s)]
*  the annexation as a pretext to try and reclaim more territory later on. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1508.1s)]
*  James, can I ask you this question that comes in from Philip? Do you think this deal will stop [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1514.6599999999999s)]
*  the Russians taking the rest of Ukraine or at least hold them at their present positions? [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1519.2199999999998s)]
*  What he's asking is, will this change Russian thinking in terms of their tactics? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1524.4199999999998s)]
*  Well, I mean, James said earlier, the presence of American companies didn't exactly make Vladimir [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1530.02s)]
*  Putin think twice in in 2022. I think if you're Russia and you're Vladimir Putin, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1536.26s)]
*  and we've had guests on the podcast, haven't we, who've, you know, like Sir Ben Wallace, former [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1543.86s)]
*  defence minister here in the UK, he went to go meet Vladimir Putin and he met a Russian leader [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1548.42s)]
*  in legacy mode. This is a Russian president not just refusing to recognise Ukraine as a country [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1553.22s)]
*  or its people, as being distinctive or separate in any way. He's also looking to restore what he [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1561.54s)]
*  sees as lost power and influence after the collapse of the Soviet Union. He threw everything, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1567.94s)]
*  albeit on flawed intelligence and tactics, he threw everything to try and take Ukraine, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1575.22s)]
*  all of it in 2022. And the only reason he has scaled back in that ambition is because of [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1582.02s)]
*  the fight Ukraine has put up with the help of its Western allies and the transformation [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1589.78s)]
*  its military has gone through. So does Vladimir Putin privately reassess his goals? Or is he going [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1593.94s)]
*  to completely shelve his ambition of taking hold of Ukraine? I can't see that. There is no evidence [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1602.02s)]
*  suggesting that. And the real fear in Ukraine is that Russia will just bide its time, use a frozen [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1606.26s)]
*  conflict, perhaps probe here and there to test the will of Western allies. And it'll just have [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1613.46s)]
*  another go at either taking those four provinces or beyond down the line. And that threat has not [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1618.82s)]
*  gone away. And yeah, let's not forget that Russia would be potentially interested in a temporary, [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1624.4199999999998s)]
*  at least ceasefire because they have lost a lot of men, they have lost a lot of hardware, and you [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1630.1s)]
*  know, it takes time to replenish that. So yeah, you could see how they would be interested in [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1636.58s)]
*  potentially the kind of temporary halt in hostilities. But that doesn't mean that they [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1640.98s)]
*  would be interested in a long term peace. Well, we've already discussed the potential [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1647.06s)]
*  of that meeting that we saw between President Trump and President Zelensky and the Vatican, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1652.8999999999999s)]
*  whether that was a turning point. We've actually just had a question that's come in about that. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1656.98s)]
*  Hello, Ukrainecast. This is Paul from Bedfordshire Calling. I was watching the Pope's funeral at the [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1661.62s)]
*  weekend and wondered if we know if President Putin was sent an invite to the funeral, or if a Russian [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1667.62s)]
*  delegate attended in his place. And secondly, have we any idea what Russians, particularly Russian [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1676.02s)]
*  Catholics, think about all the world leaders attending the ceremony, but President Putin was [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1682.66s)]
*  not in attendance? Thank you very much. Keep up the good work. I think that's one for you Olga. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1690.34s)]
*  Right. So we don't actually know if he was officially invited because the Kremlin said he [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1695.3799999999999s)]
*  didn't plan to go. Instead, it was the Culture Minister who went, which is interesting because [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1700.74s)]
*  Culture Minister is a senior position in the Russian government, but not really as influential [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1709.94s)]
*  as a foreign minister or a prime minister. So it's kind of a much lower level in the ranking in that [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1714.42s)]
*  sense. When it comes to the Russian reaction to Putin not going, generally the comments on social [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1720.34s)]
*  media that I have seen in response to that have been that, well, he didn't go, but he did actually [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1730.02s)]
*  say that he was sorry for the loss of the Catholic Church and he said really good things about the [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1736.5s)]
*  Pope. So they were kind of trying to play it as something that is highlighting something good [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1743.22s)]
*  about Putin not going. James? There is, of course, the little small point of an international [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1751.1399999999999s)]
*  arrest warrant being out for Vladimir Putin and Italy is a signatory to that court. Now, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1756.66s)]
*  in theory, if you're travelling from the airport at Rome into the Vatican City, which is not a [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1764.1000000000001s)]
*  signatory, in theory you get safe passage in the same way that people who are sanctioned can go to [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1770.98s)]
*  visit the United Nations in New York. You are technically passing through the United States, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1776.26s)]
*  but you don't get picked up. Would Vladimir Putin want to take that risk? [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1780.18s)]
*  And we know that he hasn't been travelling out of Russia that much in the past few years. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1785.6200000000001s)]
*  We've just got a few seconds left and James, I wonder, you're here in London with us, but [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1790.02s)]
*  when this deal was signed, what your thoughts were, like a final thought [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1794.5s)]
*  as we look ahead on the significance of this moment? [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1798.5s)]
*  It's been very difficult for Ukraine since January when Donald Trump took office. I think [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1801.38s)]
*  we've all been taken aback as a team at the recalibration with this White House, but [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1806.66s)]
*  reading this deal for the first time after Donald Trump has said what he said about [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1813.8600000000001s)]
*  Volodymyr Zelensky, accusing him of being responsible for this war, calling him a dictator, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1818.74s)]
*  that over-office shouting match, there is so much at stake for Ukraine. When moments like that happen, [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1823.7s)]
*  its very future hinges in the balance. That is the fact of where we are at the moment with this [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1830.18s)]
*  continued full-scale invasion. This war is continuing to fight. This agreement doesn't bring us closer. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1835.5400000000002s)]
*  I don't think yet to a peace agreement, but it's a rare bit of good news for Ukraine. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1842.82s)]
*  James, it's good to have you with us in London. As the Ukraine correspondent, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1847.06s)]
*  you never really get a holiday, but I hope you get some rest. Really nice to see you. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1850.1s)]
*  Olga, thank you so much for your thoughts. James Landau, as always, our diplomatic correspondent. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1853.78s)]
*  Very good to have you with us. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkrjvrAb8RE&t=1857.86s)]
