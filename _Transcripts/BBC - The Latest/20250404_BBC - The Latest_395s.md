Video Description: In Canada, assisted dying was made legal nearly a decade ago, and more than 15,000 people a year have a medically-assisted death in the country.
 
The vast majority of them are terminally ill, and many of them choose to die at home.
 
Canada now has one of the most liberal systems of assisted dying in the world, similar to that operating in the Netherlands and Belgium.
 
But, opponents say death is coming to be seen as a standard treatment option for those with disabilities and complex medical problems.

# Has assisted dying in Canada gone too far? | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [April 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30)
*  Legalising assisted dying in England and Wales has long been debated in Parliament. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=0.0s)]
*  Last time was in 2015 and it's been back in the Commons since last November when a majority [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=5.0s)]
*  of MPs voted in favour of the law but the specifics are still being debated by MPs. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=10.0s)]
*  Currently the criteria of the Bill includes being aged over 18, having the mental capacity [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=15.0s)]
*  to take the choice free of coercion and being expected to die within six months. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=21.0s)]
*  On Thursday we saw medical editor Fergus Walsh's trip to California, a place of inspiration [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=26.0s)]
*  for the proposed law. Now Fergus has this report from Canada where assisted dying was [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=31.0s)]
*  legalised almost a decade ago and there he met April Hubbard to find out why she's planning [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=36.0s)]
*  to use the drug. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=41.0s)]
*  More than 15,000 people a year have a medically assisted death in Canada. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=44.0s)]
*  The vast majority are terminally ill and many of them choose to die at home. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=50.0s)]
*  This theatre feels like the most special, unique place on earth for me and it just feels [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=58.0s)]
*  fitting that I should take my final breath here. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=65.0s)]
*  But this is where performance artist April Hubbard wants to die, on stage, at her local [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=69.0s)]
*  theatre in Halifax, Nova Scotia. She is not terminally ill. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=76.0s)]
*  Why do you want to end your life? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=82.0s)]
*  I want to end my life because the balance of being able to live and enjoy life is no [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=84.0s)]
*  longer outweighing the pain that I'm in. And there's many days where I can't lift my head [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=91.0s)]
*  off the pillow and I can't eat anymore and it's not a way I want to live for another [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=97.0s)]
*  10 or 20 or 30 years. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=103.0s)]
*  A serious spinal condition means April has been on strong opioid painkillers for more [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=108.0s)]
*  than 20 years, including these fentanyl patches. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=114.0s)]
*  So these four medications are my core meds that I have to have all the time to function [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=119.0s)]
*  right now. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=125.0s)]
*  She's been approved for medical assistance in dying, made, because her condition is incurable [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=126.0s)]
*  and she finds her suffering intolerable. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=132.0s)]
*  Made is very much another medical choice for me. It's another type of medical care. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=135.0s)]
*  But that ability to have autonomy over my own body has been the leading factor for me. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=141.0s)]
*  Canada's assisted dying laws were introduced as a result of legal challenges in the courts. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=148.0s)]
*  That's unlike the situation in Britain, where momentous social changes are left to Parliament [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=155.0s)]
*  rather than judges. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=162.0s)]
*  In two years, Canada plans to extend assisted dying to adults with a mental illness and [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=164.0s)]
*  no physical ailment. The government says the law respects the rights of the individual [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=171.0s)]
*  while protecting the vulnerable. For critics, it's a further slide down an already slippery [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=177.0s)]
*  slope. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=184.0s)]
*  Opponents of Made argue it's being used as an alternative to social or medical support. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=188.0s)]
*  Ramona Coelho, a family doctor, says it's far quicker to get aid in dying than specialist care. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=196.0s)]
*  Canada has fallen off a cliff. I wouldn't even call it a slippery slope. When people have [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=203.0s)]
*  suicidal ideations, we used to meet them with counselling and care. And actually for people [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=208.0s)]
*  with terminal illness and other diseases, we could mitigate that suffering and help [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=214.0s)]
*  them have a better life. And yet now we are seeing that as an appropriate request to die [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=218.0s)]
*  and ending their lives very quickly. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=224.0s)]
*  Sharon Scribner's family say she was repeatedly offered Made when she was dying of lung cancer [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=228.0s)]
*  in hospital at the age of 81. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=234.0s)]
*  We had the nurse come in saying, you should fill this paper out Sharon before you go so [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=237.0s)]
*  you can get on the list to see the Made doctor. And my mum said no, no thanks. They really [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=244.0s)]
*  did not want us to leave until my mum had signed these papers. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=251.0s)]
*  You brought your mum home to die. What was her death like? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=257.0s)]
*  Beautiful. We had the palliative care team in the community came in and it gave all the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=261.0s)]
*  family time to visit her. They came from far and wide and she had the best last day of [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=268.0s)]
*  her life. So it was special. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=274.0s)]
*  Strangely these days I use my stethoscope more to determine if someone has no heartbeat. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=278.0s)]
*  Dr. Conya Troughton has administered lethal doses to hundreds of patients. She says Made [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=283.0s)]
*  is working well in Canada. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=290.0s)]
*  So I'd start it into venus, probably there. Start it through there, OK, and then I'd secure [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=292.0s)]
*  it in place. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=298.0s)]
*  Injecting the drugs means it usually takes only a few minutes to die. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=300.0s)]
*  That's where the drugs would go in? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=305.0s)]
*  Yeah, the drugs would be threaded through here so each of this just has a little barrel [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=307.0s)]
*  that I can attach a syringe to. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=311.0s)]
*  This is not what's planned for England and Wales, where patients would need to self-administer, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=313.0s)]
*  usually drink the dose. She says it's more effective for doctors to carry it out. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=319.0s)]
*  For the patients at the last moment they're always looking in my eyes and giving me the [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=326.0s)]
*  heads up and ready to go. They are directing the process. That gives me an honour and a [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=329.0s)]
*  duty and a privilege to be able to help them in those last moments with their family around [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=336.0s)]
*  them, with those who love them around them and to know that they've made that decision [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=340.0s)]
*  thoughtfully, carefully and thoroughly. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=344.0s)]
*  Terminally ill patients can get approval to die in just 24 hours. For April it took seven [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=348.0s)]
*  months. Now she has the go-ahead, she feels reassured. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=355.0s)]
*  Without that safety net I don't think I'd have the courage to keep taking the risk of [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=360.0s)]
*  living and I think I would have made that choice to end it myself and alone and without [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=365.0s)]
*  the support of the people I love long ago and my fear is that that's what will happen [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=371.0s)]
*  for many folks around the world. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=377.0s)]
*  April has not set a date for her death but says it will be sometime in the coming months [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=381.0s)]
*  surrounded by family and loved ones. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_l6XJkS30&t=387.0s)]
