*  The UN has called on India and Pakistan to exercise maximum restraint as each side threatens [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=0.0s)]
*  the other in the wake of Tuesday's attack in disputed Kashmir. Police say they've identified [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=6.72s)]
*  three gunmen from Pakistan who they think were responsible for the murders of 26 Indian [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  tourists. Delhi has since suspended a water sharing treaty with Pakistan and they've [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=17.48s)]
*  closed the main land border between the two countries. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=22.38s)]
*  Well we've got coverage from both sides. The Rana Day Mukherjee is in Delhi and Azadeh [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=26.28s)]
*  Mishiri is in Islamabad. Azadeh, there are real fears of an escalation here. You've been [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=30.720000000000002s)]
*  speaking to the defence minister of Pakistan. Tell us what he said. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=35.8s)]
*  Well the Pakistani government's position is clear. They reject any allegations that Pakistan [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=42.28s)]
*  was involved in this attack. In fact in a largely symbolic move today the Senate passed [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  a resolution rejecting those allegations, calling it a campaign by India and also condemning [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=53.68s)]
*  the unilateral suspension of the water treaty. It says that that move is unlawful. Now when [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=59.56s)]
*  we asked the Pakistani defence minister about this he said that Pakistan could not take [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=66.92s)]
*  it lying down. This treaty has been in place since 1960 and it governs the Indus River [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=73.44s)]
*  sharing system, the sharing of that water system and it guarantees the water flow from [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=80.4s)]
*  three western rivers to Pakistan. And so we asked the defence minister how Pakistan views [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=86.08000000000001s)]
*  any move to halt or divert the flow of water from the Indus River and this is what he said. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=93.0s)]
*  It will be a declaration of war, you know. You are actually depriving us of water which [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=99.68s)]
*  is our right, which was acknowledged by India as it is written in that treaty. We want that [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=107.04s)]
*  treaty to stay alive. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=113.4s)]
*  Now India accuses Pakistan of being indirectly involved in the attack because it accuses [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=119.56s)]
*  Pakistani militants based on Pakistani soil of being behind this attack. Now we put this [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=126.0s)]
*  to the defence minister and asked him whether he views Pakistan as having any responsibility [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=134.06s)]
*  to monitor or contain militants on its soil, especially given the history of attacks by [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=138.86s)]
*  militant groups operating in Pakistan and then also operating in India, Indian administered [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=146.86s)]
*  Kashmir and he denied, despite US intelligence or Indian intelligence to the country, that [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=154.34s)]
*  any of these groups operate today. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=160.74s)]
*  They are redundant and they are like... [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=164.46s)]
*  What does redundant mean? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=167.42000000000002s)]
*  Redundant means that they are inactive, they have become extinct, you know. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=168.9s)]
*  But do you therefore think that any sort of US bounties that are on anyone's heads or [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=174.46s)]
*  someone like Hafiz Saeed, you believe that these are just outdated? Is that what you're saying? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=179.14000000000001s)]
*  They are outdated, they are part of the archives. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=184.1s)]
*  That the US should get rid of it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=187.02s)]
*  Yeah, they are part of the archives now, you know. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=188.02s)]
*  Now the stakes are high. India and Pakistan both claim all of Kashmir and they fought [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=190.34s)]
*  two wars and a limited conflict over it. And the last time we got to a point where there [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=198.7s)]
*  were Indian air strikes, where there was any form of back and forth military action was [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=204.82s)]
*  in 2019. At this point the defence minister said we're still in the realm of diplomatic [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=209.18s)]
*  But the possibility of that escalation is there. As he said, he views, and Pakistan views, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=215.9s)]
*  any action when it comes to this treaty as a declaration of war and will be monitoring [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=222.82s)]
*  what's happening with that water flow very closely. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=227.62s)]
*  And currently the government has told us that no third party, no country and the World Bank [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=231.86s)]
*  is not mediating this in any way right now. So what happens in the next few days and weeks [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=236.54000000000002s)]
*  could determine whether this escalates into a full blown conflict. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=242.1s)]
*  Azadeh, for the moment thank you very much. Let's speak to Ranadeh Mukherjee in Delhi. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=246.42s)]
*  An absolute rejection there by Pakistan that they are involved in this at all, Ranadeh. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=251.54s)]
*  So where is India's evidence? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=256.62s)]
*  Well India has repeatedly over several decades has made this allegation that Pakistan has [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=260.54s)]
*  backed separatist forces which have fermented unrest in Indian administered Kashmir and [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=266.18s)]
*  it's the same story every time. India makes those allegations and Pakistan denies it. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=271.46s)]
*  But in this case what is very significant and what makes the situation a little more [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=275.09999999999997s)]
*  unique is the scale of what we saw this time around in Indian administered Kashmir. This [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=279.7s)]
*  is the first time in a sense in recent years that we've seen this kind of an attack take [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=284.65999999999997s)]
*  place and directed at civilians really and that's something that has left the country [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=288.78s)]
*  shocked and also angry and which is why there is growing pressure on the Indian government, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=293.7s)]
*  especially Prime Minister Modi's party the BJP which leads an alliance at the government [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=300.46s)]
*  that they must appear to do something and send a very strong message. So we've heard [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=305.46s)]
*  that tough talk from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and members of his cabinet, Prime Minister [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=309.73999999999995s)]
*  Modi himself saying that they will pursue the attackers till the ends of earth. What [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=314.21999999999997s)]
*  does that essentially mean? What will that translate into is what the concern really [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=318.14s)]
*  is as these two nuclear armed neighbours get into a sort of a war of words. Where does [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=321.78s)]
*  it go from here? We've seen in the past as Azadeh was also mentioning that in 2016 [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=328.36s)]
*  there was a terror attack in Indian administered Kashmir which India responded with what it [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=333.96000000000004s)]
*  called were surgical strikes in Pakistan administered Kashmir. In 2019 there was another terror [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=339.08000000000004s)]
*  attack in Indian administered Kashmir to which India once again responded with limited strikes [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=345.2s)]
*  in Pakistani territory. So when we speak to analysts they say look the precedent is very [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=350.64s)]
*  much there if you take the past as evidence. So this time around you have to match that [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=355.36s)]
*  in a sense. The government has to match that because they've already done it in the past [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=360.78000000000003s)]
*  and given the scale of what we saw this time around what is India going to do next? That [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=363.8s)]
*  is where the concern lies. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=368.0s)]
*  Arun Nadei, thank you very much. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKAS-Q6oBOE&t=369.40000000000003s)]
