Video Description: US President Donald Trump has confirmed he is delaying tariffs on imports from Mexico for a month.
 
It comes after Mexico agreed to send 10,000 troops to the border to stem the flow of illegal drugs. 
 
Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum said the agreement also includes a commitment from the US to take steps to limit the flow of guns south.
 
Trump had previously said a 25% import tax on goods from Mexico would begin on Tuesday, along with tariffs on goods from Canada and China.

# Donald Trump confirms one month ‘pause’ in Mexico tariffs | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [February 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0)
*  US President Donald Trump is delaying tariffs on imports from Mexico for a month, its president [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=0.0s)]
*  Claudia Schoenbaum says. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=6.0s)]
*  She spoke to Trump on the phone earlier today and told reporters she had gained the concession [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=7.88s)]
*  in return for increased efforts to combat cross-border drug trafficking. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=12.68s)]
*  President Trump has posted on Truth Social about his phone call with the Mexican leader, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=18.26s)]
*  saying it was a very friendly conversation wherein she agreed to immediately supply 10,000 [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=22.64s)]
*  soldiers on the border separating Mexico and the US. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=28.92s)]
*  We further agreed to immediately pause the anticipated tariffs for a one-month period, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=32.800000000000004s)]
*  during which we'll have negotiations headed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=37.96s)]
*  of the Treasury Scott Besant and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=43.0s)]
*  And President Trump said, I look forward to participating in those negotiations with President [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=48.58s)]
*  Schoenbaum as we attempt to achieve a deal between our two countries. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=53.2s)]
*  Well, Mr. Trump had said a 25% import tax on goods from Mexico would begin on Tuesday, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=58.56s)]
*  along with tariffs on goods from Canada and China. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=64.0s)]
*  US stock markets are down after opening for the first day of trading since President Trump [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=67.56s)]
*  confirmed those tariffs. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=72.44s)]
*  He's also said that he'll definitely impose taxes on goods imported to the US from the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=74.12s)]
*  EU. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=79.36s)]
*  Well, in a moment, we'll get reaction to the tariffs from Mexico with our correspondent [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=80.36s)]
*  But first, let's go to Washington and our correspondent there, Merlin Thomas. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=85.52000000000001s)]
*  And Merlin, bring us up to date on anything else the Trump administration is saying about [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=89.8s)]
*  the subject of tariffs. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=93.84s)]
*  So President Trump has said that he had a very friendly conversation with the Mexican [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=97.12s)]
*  president, and that will result in 10,000 troops being deployed to the border from Mexico, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=101.64s)]
*  and that will reinforce the border and its security. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=107.76s)]
*  Now this will be a welcome reprieve for Mexico, but for President Trump, this will be characterized [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=110.56s)]
*  as a big win. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=114.72000000000001s)]
*  The White House will declare this as a victory. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=115.88000000000001s)]
*  And be it economic, be it strategic, this is really a sign of his intended motivation [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=118.44000000000001s)]
*  for these tariffs to be used as a negotiating tactic to get the stated aims that he wants. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=123.08000000000001s)]
*  So he said he wanted to curb immigration and to stop the flow of illegal drugs, and that [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=128.08s)]
*  is what he will be able to say that he has done. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=132.0s)]
*  And for his fan base, for his supporters, this will be characterized as President Trump [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=135.8s)]
*  has gone to battle with Mexico. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=140.0s)]
*  He stood up for what he believed in, and he has achieved what he wanted. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=141.4s)]
*  Now Canada will be looking at this development very closely, as it's at the beginning of [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=145.16s)]
*  what appears to be an all-out trade war, and they've already announced a raft of measures [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=151.76s)]
*  on over $100 billion worth of goods. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=156.88s)]
*  And so for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the question is, will he be able to cut a [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=159.8s)]
*  similar deal with the American president? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=163.56s)]
*  Okay, Merlin, we will ask that question in a few moments, but thank you for the moment. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  Bill Grant has sent this update from Mexico City. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=171.12s)]
*  Shortly before her morning press conference, Claudia Sheinbaum put out a statement on the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=174.84s)]
*  social media site X in which she said that Mexico will immediately reinforce its northern [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=180.76s)]
*  border, that's of course the border with the United States, with 10,000 members of the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  National Guard, and they would focus on drug trafficking, particularly fentanyl. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=190.68s)]
*  That the US was committed to working to prevent the trafficking of high-powered weapons south [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=195.76s)]
*  into Mexico, an important point for her. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=200.2s)]
*  And then of course the main point in terms of the tariffs and the threat of tariffs, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=202.4s)]
*  she said they are pausing tariffs for one month from now. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=206.64s)]
*  So look, both sides are likely to present that outcome as a victory. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=211.24s)]
*  Claudia Sheinbaum can say that she's got a commitment from Donald Trump to focus on the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=215.96s)]
*  issue of weapons coming into Mexico from the US, arming the Mexican drug cartels, a point [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=221.72s)]
*  that successive governments have made to successive governments in Washington. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=229.56s)]
*  So that will be a plus for her. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=234.32000000000002s)]
*  And of course, critically, she's staved off the tariffs for another month. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=236.32000000000002s)]
*  In turn, Donald Trump will say, look, simply the threat of tariffs against one of our neighbours [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=241.0s)]
*  is enough to bring them to the negotiating table and get what I want, which is more people [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=246.06s)]
*  on the border, more focus on undocumented immigrants and on fentanyl trafficking. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=250.10000000000002s)]
*  The truth is there has been a bit of movement on both sides. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=256.08s)]
*  For the Mexican economy, this is a good thing, because if the tariffs are to be imposed elsewhere [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=258.88s)]
*  on China, the EU, on Canada, creating the potential for a global trade war, then certainly [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=265.76s)]
*  Mexico is in a good position for the next month. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=273.68s)]
*  This cross-border trade is worth hundreds of billions to the two neighbours every year. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=277.36s)]
*  And that she has avoided the threat of tariffs on that trade will certainly be presented [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=284.0s)]
*  as a victory by her camp. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=290.6s)]
*  Will Grant reporting from Mexico City. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=293.2s)]
*  So what exactly is a tariff and why do governments use them as an economic tool? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=296.08000000000004s)]
*  To explain this, we're joined by Clarissa Han from Oxford Economics. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=300.6s)]
*  Clarissa, thank you very much. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=304.56s)]
*  We're not all economists, are we? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=305.96000000000004s)]
*  Unlike you. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=308.36s)]
*  So it's really useful, I think, just to take a step back and consider what a tariff is [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=309.84s)]
*  and how it's used. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=314.71999999999997s)]
*  So you have that basic definition of a tariff, first of all, if you would. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=316.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=319.35999999999996s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=320.35999999999996s)]
*  So tariffs are taxes imposed by a government on goods and services imported from other [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=321.35999999999996s)]
*  countries. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=326.59999999999997s)]
*  So you can think of it like an extra cost added to foreign products when they enter [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=327.59999999999997s)]
*  the country. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=331.28s)]
*  So they're usually a percentage of the price of the good, making imported items a bit more [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=333.08s)]
*  expensive compared to locally produced goods. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=337.92s)]
*  So say I sell an apple to the US at £1, 25% tariff basically means that as a producer, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=339.96000000000004s)]
*  I now only get 75p in my pocket. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=347.24s)]
*  So what you do to raise, you raise the price to protect your margin. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=350.08000000000004s)]
*  So that means the US consumer just faces a higher price for something as simple as a [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=354.08000000000004s)]
*  foreign apple. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=358.20000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=359.20000000000005s)]
*  So typically in a situation where tariffs are being imposed by one country, does that [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=360.20000000000005s)]
*  benefit the country imposing them or does it end up not working out so well for that [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=366.24s)]
*  country? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=371.72s)]
*  I guess it depends on the situation. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=372.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=373.72s)]
*  So I mean, if we think of it, say in the case of the US, right, so the country imposing [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=374.72s)]
*  the tariff. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=379.76000000000005s)]
*  So in a country like the US, domestic industries might benefit because of reduced foreign competition [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=381.04s)]
*  in the most simple way. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=386.28000000000003s)]
*  So foreign goods are now relatively more expensive. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=387.92s)]
*  This would drive up demand for domestic products. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=391.0s)]
*  So allowing domestic industries to expand production as they see higher increase in [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=393.98s)]
*  demand. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=398.58000000000004s)]
*  But it might not be so simple because obviously US industries and industries globally have [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=399.58000000000004s)]
*  global supply chains. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=407.02000000000004s)]
*  So they rely on imported materials or parts. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=408.90000000000003s)]
*  So say for example, if you are a US car producer, even if tariffs are being imposed on other [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=413.14000000000004s)]
*  countries, the cost of materials and parts that go into the car may have increased as [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=419.54s)]
*  a result of the tariff. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=426.26000000000005s)]
*  So because industries now have such global supply chains, in a way domestic industries [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=427.86s)]
*  may benefit, but as supply chains are so global, they might also see a higher, an increase [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=434.18s)]
*  in cost of production, say. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=440.04s)]
*  Typically is a tariff as much a political tool as an economic one? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=443.38s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, so a tariff can, as a government imposing it, can be used for many different [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=449.3s)]
*  reasons, right? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=455.86s)]
*  So some people talk about, you know, maybe they're doing it to increase government revenue. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=456.86s)]
*  It is a tax after all. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=462.42s)]
*  But we see in this example with Trump, it's often also used as a political tool and a [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=464.06s)]
*  negotiation tool with other countries. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=470.34s)]
*  But as we've just talked about, it's also really popular with citizens sometimes because [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=473.85999999999996s)]
*  it boosts domestic industries, obviously, when you take out the complication of the [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=478.73999999999995s)]
*  global supply chains. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=484.53999999999996s)]
*  Okay, and then Clarissa, in terms of the tariffs we're talking about in this particular instance, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=486.17999999999995s)]
*  up to 25%, for example, on Canada and Mexico, although the Mexican tariff has been delayed [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=491.38s)]
*  for a month. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=498.58000000000004s)]
*  Is that a big percentage or do tariffs tend to be smaller usually? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=500.7s)]
*  I mean, we've seen, we've done some modelling exercises globally, internally, and 25% tariffs [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=506.86s)]
*  can cause big implications on the countries they're imposed on. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=515.5s)]
*  So say, for example, in Canada, where we've seen the tariffs go through so far, more than [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=522.22s)]
*  70% of exports are to the US. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVT_LbtZS0&t=528.34s)]
