# Israel and Iran exchange attacks overnight with 'fears of more to come' #Israel #Iran #BBCNews
**BBC - The Latest:** [June 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WzNazzXX-k)
*  So it was a very long night of attacks with sirens sounded across the country and earlier this morning [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WzNazzXX-k&t=0.0s)]
*  sirens sounded again in parts of Israel. There were very loud explosions here in Jerusalem as the country's air defence systems [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WzNazzXX-k&t=6.44s)]
*  tried to intercept those missiles that had been fired by Iran. A residential area in a city south of Tel Aviv was hit. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WzNazzXX-k&t=15.38s)]
*  So this is the Iranian response following those large-scale Israeli attacks yesterday targeting key nuclear and military facilities [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WzNazzXX-k&t=25.04s)]
*  also killing some of the country's most senior military officials and scientists. And there is a state of emergency here in Israel. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WzNazzXX-k&t=34.32s)]
*  Obviously the authorities are urging the public to stay alert, to follow the instructions because they believe that these attacks are likely to continue [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WzNazzXX-k&t=43.64s)]
*  and today there have been reports of more Israeli attacks in Iran, reports of explosions in Tehran, the capital with an airport being hit. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WzNazzXX-k&t=54.64s)]
*  So the Israeli campaign continues and I think the authorities are expecting more Iranian attacks in response to these Israeli strikes. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WzNazzXX-k&t=65.08s)]
