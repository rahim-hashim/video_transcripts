Video Description: Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the Hamas leader Mohammed Sinwar has probably been killed in an airstrike in Gaza.   He’s the brother of the former Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar who was killed by Israeli forces in Gaza last October. 

In a news conference Netanyah struck a defiant tone in the face of international criticism, insisting that the entire Gaza Strip would be taken under Israeli security control and Hamas destroyed, in the latest Israeli military offensive. 

The UK government has said that Israel is using hunger “as a weapon of war” in Gaza and the UN has said the territory is facing famine.   Palestinians there are still waiting for aid to arrive after Israel eased an 11-week blockade.  Israeli officials said 93 trucks entered Gaza on Tuesday but the UN says that's a small fraction of what's needed and its teams have not been able to distribute the aid.
