*  The man who led the Catholic Church for 12 years, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=3.52s)]
*  steering it through a period of change, died on Monday morning. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=7.04s)]
*  Cardinal Giovanni Battista Ray, who led the mass, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=11.56s)]
*  said the Pope had touched minds and hearts [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=14.56s)]
*  and wanted to build bridges, not walls. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=18.12s)]
*  An estimated quarter of a million mourners [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=21.88s)]
*  have packed the streets with tens of thousands [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=24.2s)]
*  inside St Peter's Square itself. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=27.36s)]
*  Pope Francis' body will be interred [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=30.88s)]
*  in the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=33.24s)]
*  the first pope to be buried outside the Vatican [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=35.6s)]
*  for more than a century. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=38.52s)]
*  It's a place close to the Pope's heart, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  which he visited after every trip abroad to pray. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=42.84s)]
*  Among the many global heads of state and leaders attending [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=47.72s)]
*  were Presidents Trump and Zelensky. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=51.24s)]
*  After paying their respects, they held their first meeting [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=53.72s)]
*  since the bitter exchange at the White House in February. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=56.519999999999996s)]
*  President Trump said it had been very productive. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=60.04s)]
*  President Zelensky said, as well as being symbolic, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=63.12s)]
*  it had the potential to be historic [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=66.0s)]
*  if we achieve joint results. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=68.64s)]
*  But we'll have more on the meeting later in the programme. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=71.28s)]
*  But first, our World News correspondent, Joe Inwood, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=73.84s)]
*  reports on the main events from today's funeral. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=76.96s)]
*  Even for a pope defined by his humility, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=82.52s)]
*  determined to be buried in a way that reflected [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=85.08000000000001s)]
*  the poverty of the people he served, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=87.44000000000001s)]
*  there was no avoiding the grandeur of the setting [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=89.68s)]
*  or the history of this moment. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=92.64s)]
*  Pope Francis had chosen a simple wooden coffin. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  And it was in front of this that world leaders, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=101.4s)]
*  including President Trump, paused to pay their respects. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=103.56s)]
*  They came from all over the world, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=110.4s)]
*  not only Christian nations. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=112.4s)]
*  But also the world's most important people. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=115.04s)]
*  Prince William was representing the King. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=121.56s)]
*  The Prime Minister also paying his respects. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=125.88000000000001s)]
*  There was a ripple of applause as President Zelensky of Ukraine [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=133.08s)]
*  appeared on the big screen. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=136.24s)]
*  This was not a moment for politics, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=137.84s)]
*  but reflection and remembrance. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=140.68s)]
*  Next, the Cardinals filed past. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=142.67999999999998s)]
*  For the first time, the majority of these men, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=145.27999999999997s)]
*  who will choose his successor, are non-European. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=147.83999999999997s)]
*  A sign of the impact Pope Francis had on the Church. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=151.55999999999997s)]
*  CHOIR SINGING [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=154.96s)]
*  Pope Francis wanted his coffin not raised, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=172.36s)]
*  but on a level with the people, as the funeral mass began. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=175.16s)]
*  Then the liturgy of the word, two Bible readings. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=180.56s)]
*  A reading from the Acts of the Apostles. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=184.23999999999998s)]
*  In those days, Peter opened his mouth and said, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=188.16s)]
*  truly, I understand that God shows no partiality. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=192.95999999999998s)]

*  The service was led by the Dean of the College of Cardinals. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=230.92s)]
*  He was a Pope among the people, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=235.23999999999998s)]
*  with an open heart towards everyone. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=241.24s)]
*  He was also a Pope attentive to the signs of the times, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=246.08s)]
*  and what the Holy Spirit was awakening in the Church. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=253.92000000000002s)]
*  With his characteristic vocabulary and language, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=259.04s)]
*  rich in images and metaphors, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=263.48s)]
*  he always sought to shed light on the problems of our time [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=267.84s)]
*  with the wisdom of the Gospel. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=275.12s)]
*  In front of world leaders, many of whom won power [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=278.44s)]
*  with messages contrary to that of Pope Francis, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=280.91999999999996s)]
*  there was praise for his championing of the poor [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=284.2s)]
*  and the disadvantaged. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=286.64s)]
*  His gestures and exhortations in favour of refugees [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=290.64s)]
*  and displaced persons are countless. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=295.64s)]

*  the wider Catholic community and much of the rest of the world [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1D8sCkemgU&t=322.64s)]
