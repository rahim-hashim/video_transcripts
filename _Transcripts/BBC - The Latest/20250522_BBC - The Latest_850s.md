Video Description: Two Israeli embassy staff have been shot dead outside a Jewish museum in downtown Washington DC, officials have said.

The man and woman were a couple and were killed while leaving an event focused on helping Gazans at the Capital Jewish Museum, the event organiser told the BBC.

The suspect has been detained and identified by police as 30-year-old Elias Rodriguez.

Police said he shouted “free Palestine” after being taken into custody, and officers would “look into ties to potential terrorism”.

**BBC - The Latest:** [May 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s)
*  Hello, I'm Sally Bundock. Let's bring you the very latest on the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=0.0s)]
*  breaking news from Washington where two people who work for the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=4.0s)]
*  Israeli embassy have been shot dead whilst they were attending an [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=8.0s)]
*  event at the capital Jewish museum. The shooting occurred just after [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=12.0s)]
*  9pm local time last night. The suspect, named by police as 30-year-old [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=17.0s)]
*  Elias Rodriguez is in custody. Washington's police chief said the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=24.0s)]
*  suspect approached the victims with a handgun shouting, free, free [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=29.0s)]
*  Palestine. The Israeli ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Dernon, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=34.0s)]
*  described the attack as a deprived act of anti-Semitic terrorism. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=39.0s)]
*  Now, in a statement on Truth Social, President Donald Trump has said [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=46.0s)]
*  this. These horrible DC killings based obviously on anti-Semitism [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=50.0s)]
*  must end now. Hatred and radicalism have no place in the USA. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=56.0s)]
*  Condolences to the families of the victims. So sad that such things as [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=62.0s)]
*  this can happen. God bless you all. Speaking at a news conference [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=68.0s)]
*  earlier, mayor of Washington DC, Muriel Bowser, says there is no [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=75.0s)]
*  active threat to the public. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=79.0s)]
*  I want to start by sending our condolences to the loved ones of the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=82.0s)]
*  victims who were senselessly a victim of these crimes. I want to [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=88.0s)]
*  provide my prayers and condolences to the museum staff and the guests [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=96.0s)]
*  who are also gathering together in fellowship. The chief will share [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=100.0s)]
*  preliminary information from the investigation. I will say up front [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=107.0s)]
*  that there is no active threat in our community. What I do know is that [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=111.0s)]
*  the horrific incident is going to frighten a lot of people in our city [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=117.0s)]
*  and in our country. I want to be clear that we will not tolerate this [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=122.0s)]
*  violence or hate in our city. We will not tolerate any acts of [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=128.0s)]
*  terrorism and we will stand together as a community in the coming days [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=134.0s)]
*  and weeks to send a clear message that we will not tolerate anti-Semitism. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=139.0s)]
*  Let's bring in our North America correspondent, Jake Kwan, who is in [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=145.0s)]
*  Washington. Jake, tell us more about what happened. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=149.0s)]
*  What we are learning is that there was a reception event at this capital [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=155.0s)]
*  Jewish museum. This museum is located just across the street from FBI [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=160.0s)]
*  field office here. It's within a mile of the Capitol. On the other side is the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=165.0s)]
*  White House. It is actually quite at the center of the D.C. There was this [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=170.0s)]
*  event for young Israeli or Jewish diplomats. The event was billed as [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=175.0s)]
*  something to bring unity to the Jewish community. It was a place for young [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=180.0s)]
*  people who are kind of starting out in their career as diplomats to come [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=185.0s)]
*  together, enjoy cocktails, talk with each other and network and have a special [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=189.0s)]
*  guest speak to them. It was one being organized by a Jewish advocacy group [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=194.0s)]
*  here. And then it was supposed to run from 6.30 until 9 p.m. So right after the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=200.0s)]
*  event had ended, four people from this event were leaving together. And before [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=205.0s)]
*  these people were leaving, a witness had seen this man, a 30-year-old, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=210.0s)]
*  Elias Rodriguez, pacing around in front of the building. And then as this group [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=216.0s)]
*  was leaving, Rodriguez approached the group and opened fire from his firearm, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=222.0s)]
*  the handgun. And two people were immediately gunned down and other people [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=227.0s)]
*  were injured. Now, the suspect had entered the building and was immediately [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=232.0s)]
*  taken into custody by the building security. He was put in handcuffs. And the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=237.0s)]
*  police and the other people, the medical team, they all arrived to find the two [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=243.0s)]
*  people, a man and a woman, gunned down, already not breathing. And they [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=249.0s)]
*  administered medical treatment, but they had died, unfortunately. And what we're [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=254.0s)]
*  learning about the victim from the Israeli ambassador to the United States is [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=261.0s)]
*  that they were a couple who were going to be engaged. And he was saying that [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=266.0s)]
*  these two people were members of the Israeli embassy here, so they were two [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=271.0s)]
*  diplomats. Now, what we know about the suspect isn't a lot. It's just that he's [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=276.0s)]
*  an American from Chicago and that when he was being taken into custody, he was [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=281.0s)]
*  yelling, free, free, Palestine. Now, the FBI said that they are investigating [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=286.0s)]
*  this killing as a one of targeted killing and that this is possible hate crime as [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=291.0s)]
*  well as terrorism. And they're looking into anti-Semitic motives. Now, this motive [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=297.0s)]
*  will, of course, be one of the central questions of why this killing had occurred, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=303.0s)]
*  whether this was planned or not, considering that this event, although it was [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=308.0s)]
*  advertised, the location of the event was not advertised. It was only available to [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=314.0s)]
*  those already registered and attending. And the fact that the man knew where to go [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=319.0s)]
*  and at what time seems to suggest that possibly it was pre-planned. Now, the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=325.0s)]
*  suspect is alive and I'm sure the rest of the investigation will be focusing on that [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=331.0s)]
*  as well. There has been an outpouring of support by the administration. We already [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=337.0s)]
*  saw the Justice Department, the secretary, Pam Bondi, who was at the site. She was [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=343.0s)]
*  writing on social media how she's already there with the D.C.'s attorney to investigate [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=349.0s)]
*  the matter. We also heard from the secretary of homeland security, Kirsty Noam, who was [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=354.0s)]
*  saying that this is a depraved act, that she will pursue this to uncover the [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=359.0s)]
*  investigation, as well as we heard from President Trump, who wrote on social media that hatred [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=368.0s)]
*  and radicalism have no place in the United States and that he strains firmly that such [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=373.0s)]
*  anti-Semitic killing has no place. And he said this is, from his view, that this is [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=383.0s)]
*  obviously an anti-Semitic killing. And we also heard from the Israeli ambassador that [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=389.0s)]
*  he got a call from President Trump saying that his administration will do all it can [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=395.0s)]
*  to end anti-Semitism, as well as these kind of attacks against Jewish and Israel, and [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=400.0s)]
*  that will be his mission. Okay, Jake, thank you so much for bringing us right up to date [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=408.0s)]
*  on the details that we do know about this incident. Here are now two eyewitnesses who [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=414.0s)]
*  spoke to BBC News in Washington, D.C., just a short while ago. Around 9.07 we heard gun [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=422.0s)]
*  shots, and then a guy came in looking really distressed, and we thought that he just like [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=427.0s)]
*  needed help. He thought he was experiencing whatever violence or something outside. And [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=434.0s)]
*  he just needed like safe shelters, so he comes in. So people were calming him down, bringing [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=439.0s)]
*  him water, taking care of him. Little did we know he was somebody that executed people in [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=444.0s)]
*  cold blood. He was the shooter? He was the shooter. Yeah. Once the police originally showed [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=449.0s)]
*  up, he's like, I did this, I'm unarmed. He pulls out a red keffiyeh, and he's like, I did this [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=455.0s)]
*  for Gaza, free Palestine. There's only one solution, Intifada revolution. And he just kept [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=460.0s)]
*  yelling free Palestine. And I'm like, dude, like this event was about humanitarian aid. How can [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=465.0s)]
*  we actually help both the people in Gaza and the people in Israel? How can we bring together [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=470.0s)]
*  Muslims and Jews and Christians to work together to actually help the innocent people? And then [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=474.0s)]
*  here he is just murdering two people in cold blood. So those are two eyewitnesses there just [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=479.0s)]
*  expressing their dismay of following these events. And also they were reiterating there the purpose [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=485.0s)]
*  of the event that was happening at the Capital Jewish Museum. It was actually an event that was [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=492.0s)]
*  focused on helping Gazans. Earlier, the Israeli ambassador to the U.S., Yeti El Leta, gave this [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=497.0s)]
*  statement. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=502.0s)]
*  I will say this. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=532.0s)]
*  We are a resilient people. The people of Israel are resilient people, and the people of the [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=537.0s)]
*  United States of America are resilient people. Together we won't be afraid. Together we'll stand, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=542.0s)]
*  and we're going to overcome moral depravity of people who think that they're going to achieve [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=547.0s)]
*  political gains. And we're going to overcome moral depravity of people who think that they're going [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=552.0s)]
*  to achieve political gains through murder. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=557.0s)]
*  On the way in, Miss Bondi was kind enough to hand me the phone. On the other line was the [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=562.0s)]
*  President of the United States, Donald Trump, who told me that his administration is going to do [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=567.0s)]
*  everything it can possibly do to fight and end anti-Semitism and the hatred that's being [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=572.0s)]
*  directed. The demonization of the people of Israel, the demonization of the people of Israel, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=577.0s)]
*  the demonization of the people of Israel, the demonization of the people of Israel, anti-Semitism, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=582.0s)]
*  anti-Semitism, and the hatred that's being directed, the demonization and delegitimization of [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=587.0s)]
*  the state of Israel. Together with President Trump, our Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=592.0s)]
*  will stand. We'll stand together tall and firm, and we will confront this moral [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=597.0s)]
*  depravity without fear and with determination. And now we'll turn to [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=602.0s)]
*  And again, I think the American administration, the city of Washington, and the law enforcement [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=607.0s)]
*  officers who are on this case are going to get to the bottom of it and bring justice [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=616.28s)]
*  to this city and to the people of Washington, the United States, and the people of Israel [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=622.08s)]
*  who are here feeling confident and safe in the city of Washington and around the United [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=629.56s)]
*  States of America. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=634.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=635.08s)]
*  That's the Israeli ambassador to the US speaking just about an hour ago. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=637.08s)]
*  Professor Stephen Zounis is coordinator of Middle Eastern studies at the University of [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=643.36s)]
*  San Francisco, and I ask for his reaction to these events. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=648.44s)]
*  It's certainly terrible. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=651.9200000000001s)]
*  I mean, the idea of diplomatic immunity goes back centuries, of course, and that diplomats [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=653.48s)]
*  should be able to do their business and attend events in various capitals without fear of [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=659.24s)]
*  attack. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=665.12s)]
*  And obviously, there are a lot of feelings up around the policies that Israel has pursued, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=667.88s)]
*  including some pretty horrific war crimes. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=674.08s)]
*  But that does not mean that people who work for that government should be susceptible [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=676.08s)]
*  to this kind of terrorism. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=681.4000000000001s)]
*  The young couple both worked for the embassy, and the head of the Metropolitan Police there [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=683.44s)]
*  in Washington, D.C., said that the suspect who's being questioned at the moment was not [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=690.52s)]
*  on their radii prior to this. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=695.84s)]
*  He was saying, free, free Palestine at the time of arrest. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=698.4399999999999s)]
*  I mean, we can draw conclusions, can't we, about what this is about? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=702.6s)]
*  Certainly. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=707.0s)]
*  It would certainly appear that way. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=708.0s)]
*  The emotions have been running high here in the United States as they have around the [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=711.92s)]
*  world. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=715.56s)]
*  There's been a lot of horror that's been unfolding for the past year and a half, and particularly [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=716.7199999999999s)]
*  here in the United States, and given that the United States has been the major international [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=720.4399999999999s)]
*  backer of Israel's war, often in a very small minority within the international community [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=725.4799999999999s)]
*  in that regard. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=731.04s)]
*  And there's great frustration, because there's a huge gap between public opinion and the [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=732.04s)]
*  policies of the U.S. government when it comes to Israel and Palestine. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=737.3199999999999s)]
*  In that environment, I guess it's not too surprising that there would be some extremists [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=742.92s)]
*  who would come out of the woodwork and would be willing to make some kind of horrific crime [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=746.92s)]
*  like this. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=752.96s)]
*  Not only, of course, is it a moral and legal travesty, but obviously this is going to set [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=756.84s)]
*  back the pro-Palestinian cause in the United States, because there are many good people [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=761.48s)]
*  out there who are not anti-Semites, who are not even anti-Zionists, who just really are [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=766.84s)]
*  horrified at what's been going on in Gaza and the West Bank and elsewhere. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=771.48s)]
*  They'd like to see a more balanced policy, but this kind of extremist violence is only [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=775.5600000000001s)]
*  going to give the Trump administration and its allies the excuse to crack down on even [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=781.6800000000001s)]
*  legitimate dissent. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=786.54s)]
*  And, of course, now there will be questions about security and what's required to protect [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=787.54s)]
*  this community across the U.S., I would imagine. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=796.12s)]
*  We need to examine, again, the motivation of the people being targeted because they [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=800.36s)]
*  were working for the government of Israel, whether they were targeted because they were [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=805.92s)]
*  Jewish. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=811.2s)]
*  Obviously, there have been some anti-Semitic attacks in the past, the horrific massacre [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=812.2s)]
*  at the Pittsburgh synagogue several years ago. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=816.28s)]
*  That was motivated not out of concern of Palestine, but the more traditional far-right anti-Jewish [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=819.16s)]
*  conspiracy realm. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=825.84s)]
*  So, certainly, any minority group that is under threat of attack does need the attention [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=829.6s)]
*  of law enforcement to make sure they can live their lives without fear. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECz5tcyU48s&t=836.08s)]
