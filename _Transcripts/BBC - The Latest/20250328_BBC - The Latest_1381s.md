# Yotam Ottolenghi on the communal power of food | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA)
*  You know you've become an adjective. I mean like I go to dinners and people say [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=0.0s)]
*  that's very Otto Lenke. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=4.0200000000000005s)]
*  Yeah it's very weird because at the end of the day it's just I'm just me. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=5.22s)]
*  Your time, you grew up in Jerusalem with parents who were both educators. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=15.64s)]
*  What was their expectation of what you were going to do in life? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=20.38s)]
*  They didn't say, they didn't tell me what their expectations were but there was a [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=26.18s)]
*  quiet expectation that I would probably become an academic. I don't remember [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=33.019999999999996s)]
*  having a conversation which must have happened. What do you want to be when you [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=38.78s)]
*  grow up? I don't remember that but I'm sure that I would have answered something [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=42.980000000000004s)]
*  along the lines of what my parents were doing like a university teacher, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=48.14s)]
*  academia, something along those lines. But I haven't committed to that but [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=53.22s)]
*  it was like inertia. You know I went to university, I studied, I did an MA and it [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=59.300000000000004s)]
*  was just the expected thing for me. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=65.34s)]
*  Was food important in your home growing up? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=68.58s)]
*  Yeah food was very important. We had good ingredients, good cooking, both my [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=71.38s)]
*  parents were good cooks. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=75.94s)]
*  So they both cooked, your mum and your dad? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=77.74000000000001s)]
*  In actual fact my father used to cook a lot because he worked more flexible hours [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=79.82s)]
*  so often when we'd come home from school around lunchtime he would do the cooking. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=85.42s)]
*  My mother was a head teacher at a school so she was not at home that much so he [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=89.53999999999999s)]
*  did much of the cooking. She also cooked but he cooked even more. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=96.3s)]
*  Did you cook too with them when you were a kid? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=100.02s)]
*  Not as much as other people that have become chefs told me. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=102.02s)]
*  You don't have this kind of idyllic Jotam Ottolenghi now, memorial of cooking at the age of five and knowing it was destined to be. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=108.74s)]
*  No I wasn't a Mozart. I used to play a bit, like my kids have got a 9 year old, 11 year old, they play. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=114.74s)]
*  So they go in the kitchen and they make an omelette and this and that regardless of the consequences [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=123.74s)]
*  or if anyone's hungry, I call it cooking as play so I used to do a bit of that but I wasn't obsessive about cooking. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=128.74s)]
*  My parents got me a cookbook for children when I was quite young and I remember that when I got the book [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=136.46s)]
*  I spent quite a lot of time cooking from that book and I did simple things. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=141.46s)]
*  We had a kosher version of sausage roll. It was called Moses in the Basket, God knows why. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=146.46s)]
*  It sounds sinister, I don't know where that came about. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=154.46s)]
*  So you're eating Paul Moses and his basket. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=157.46s)]
*  So it was like a chicken sausage inside a pastry, weird. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=160.18s)]
*  But there were some memorable recipes from that book that I remember that I used to cook when I was growing up. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=165.18s)]
*  But most of the time I just wanted to play outside with my friends. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=174.18s)]
*  You were very academic, right? You got into a gifted programme at university, you did your masters, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=177.18s)]
*  you contemplated doing a PhD. Did you always kind of feel, was there part of you that was thinking [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=185.9s)]
*  this isn't what I want, that you were missing something? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=192.9s)]
*  Did you know all along that it wasn't quite the right track? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=195.9s)]
*  Yes, I suffered from an imposter syndrome when I was at university so I did do well. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=199.9s)]
*  So I realised that I had a skill and a talent for this, for whatever that was. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=205.9s)]
*  Literature. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=212.62s)]
*  Literature and philosophy. I was studying philosophy or art philosophy and I could handle a serious conversation and write. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=213.62s)]
*  But I didn't have the curiosity that some of my other fellow students had. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=224.62s)]
*  They've been reading Wittgenstein since they were like 15 and I've just come across it the first time when I joined university. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=229.62s)]
*  I felt like an imposter in that sense, that I haven't done the work, I've just kind of landed there because I had certain talent. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=238.34s)]
*  I enjoyed my time at university but I also find it very isolating. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=247.34s)]
*  The conversation was being held amongst a group of four people, like ground-breaking stuff, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=253.34s)]
*  but actually nobody was participating. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=260.34000000000003s)]
*  I was just me, myself and my supervisor and maybe two more people that were actually interested in such an esoteric subject. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=264.06s)]
*  I was dealing with the ontological status of photographs, whatever that means to normal people. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=271.06s)]
*  I actually don't even know what that means. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=279.06s)]
*  What does it mean to represent the world in a photograph? What's the meaning of that? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=281.05999999999995s)]
*  What is the relationship with the object and what it represents? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=284.05999999999995s)]
*  I just felt isolated like that. It sounds a bit megalomaniac, I said I wanted a bigger audience. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=287.78000000000003s)]
*  I didn't think I wanted a bigger audience. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=293.78000000000003s)]
*  What I thought I wanted is a conversation with which more people actually understand. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=295.78000000000003s)]
*  Food is kind of the exact opposite of the spectrum. Food is a language that everybody understands. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=300.78000000000003s)]
*  How did you make the jump for you from that very specific conversation? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=308.78s)]
*  I was talking to my daughter, my daughter did a PhD and I know exactly what you mean. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=314.5s)]
*  It's very, very slim, the people that are interested in what you're doing and that understand what you're doing. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=317.5s)]
*  To food, because it could have been almost anything else. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=322.5s)]
*  I can understand the loneliness of academia, but then why food? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=326.5s)]
*  Yeah, it's a valid question. I spent time in journalism. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=329.5s)]
*  I used to work for an Israeli paper called Haaretz. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=334.5s)]
*  It's a left leaning daily publication. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=339.22s)]
*  I used to work in the news desk for about three or four years. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=342.22s)]
*  I used to write and edit the news items and put them on the page. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=346.22s)]
*  It was a job that I really enjoyed because I'm very into current politics in the world around me. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=351.22s)]
*  I enjoyed the hectic and the madness of the newsroom, which was what we have. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=358.22s)]
*  Everybody was smoking, it's like an old school. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=364.94000000000005s)]
*  All big chunky computers with green letters. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=367.94000000000005s)]
*  You get the news comes and you have the deadline of 10 or 11 o'clock where the morning paper has to be wrapped up. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=370.94000000000005s)]
*  I loved that. I loved being there. I loved doing that. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=378.94000000000005s)]
*  It could have been my career, I suppose, had I not... [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=382.94000000000005s)]
*  Then what happened was I left Israel in November 1995. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=387.94000000000005s)]
*  I was in the year that the Prime Minister Rabin was assassinated. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=392.66s)]
*  I was going to go away for a year to just have fun in Amsterdam. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=395.66s)]
*  I ended up living in Amsterdam for two years and kind of forgetting about Israel [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=400.66s)]
*  and enjoying life in Europe and actually not doing that much, going out a lot. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=405.66s)]
*  And cooking? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=412.65999999999997s)]
*  And cooking a bit. Yeah, I cooked more. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=413.65999999999997s)]
*  I started cooking more when I was in Amsterdam. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=416.65999999999997s)]
*  Somehow I thought, OK, I did think that if I ever go back to Israel, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=420.38000000000005s)]
*  I'd probably go back to journalism rather than academia because it felt like there's more there for me. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=425.38000000000005s)]
*  But then I came to London and I went to the Cordon Bleu. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=430.38000000000005s)]
*  Were you nervous about telling your parents that you were switching from the path that you were on, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=434.38000000000005s)]
*  the Masters track, the PhD track, to taking this leap of faith and going to Cordon Bleu? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=439.38s)]
*  I want to say I wasn't nervous, but obviously I was nervous [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=446.1s)]
*  because I didn't even have the guts to tell them over the phone. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=449.1s)]
*  I had to send them a letter. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=452.1s)]
*  Because when I finished my Masters dissertation, which was this thick document that, as I said, nobody read, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=454.1s)]
*  I sent it to them in the post, the printed edition. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=462.1s)]
*  And then there was a letter hidden inside saying, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=468.1s)]
*  by the way, I'm taking a year off academia. I'm not going to the States for a PhD. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=472.82000000000005s)]
*  I'm going to go learn how to cook. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=476.82000000000005s)]
*  So it wasn't just that you sent them a letter, you hid the letter inside the thesis. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=479.82000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. And my father called me immediately and he said to me, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=483.82000000000005s)]
*  and I have to say in the best possible way because he was a very kind, gentle person, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=488.82000000000005s)]
*  but also very clear-minded about his values. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=493.82000000000005s)]
*  And he said to me, I think you're making the most stupid mistakes you can make. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=498.54s)]
*  You know, like you're throwing away your career and your talent [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=502.54s)]
*  and what you've got going for you. And for what? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=505.54s)]
*  You know, for what? What are you going to do? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=508.54s)]
*  Are you going to cook for people? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=512.54s)]
*  He was a different generation. Now he would have been 90 years old. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=514.54s)]
*  So for him, the people who cook are the people who cook for you. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=518.54s)]
*  The irony is that he loved cooking himself, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=522.54s)]
*  but he would never thought that it was a respectable job. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=526.26s)]
*  And he didn't think it was a respectable job for me either. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=529.26s)]
*  Did he see your success? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=532.26s)]
*  Yes, he did see my success. Yeah, he did. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=534.26s)]
*  And he was very proud. And he was also humble enough to tell me that he got it all wrong. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=537.26s)]
*  You know, he said to me once on my birthday when I turned 40, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=541.26s)]
*  he said to me, you know, I can't wish you anything. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=544.26s)]
*  The only thing I can wish you is never to listen to me ever again [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=551.26s)]
*  because obviously I don't make the right decisions for you. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=554.26s)]
*  I don't have the right ideas for you. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=557.26s)]
*  It's very sweet. It was very sweet. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=559.26s)]
*  And even when he did object, he didn't object in the kind of, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=561.26s)]
*  I'm going to cut you out kind of way. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=565.26s)]
*  You know, he just really felt very emotional about it. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=567.26s)]
*  And he felt like, I really want you to understand what you're getting yourself into. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=570.26s)]
*  And now being a father, I understand that sentiment very well. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=574.26s)]
*  When you see a kid about to make a mistake [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=577.26s)]
*  and you just want to save them from making that mistake [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=580.26s)]
*  and without realising that you have to make mistakes, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=583.26s)]
*  you know, that's just part of growing up. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=586.26s)]
*  You wait. It doesn't get any easier. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=588.26s)]
*  Your kids get older and they make bigger mistakes and it gets more terrifying. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=590.26s)]
*  So you moved to London and you do your Cordon Bleu [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=593.26s)]
*  and then you finish that and eventually you end up opening your own store, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=598.26s)]
*  kind of taking another leap of faith. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=602.26s)]
*  At what stage did you realise you'd become successful? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=605.26s)]
*  So in 2002, I opened the Otolenghi Cafe at Delio Shop in Notting Hill [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=609.26s)]
*  with Nour Ambar, one of my business partners, and Sami Tamimi, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=618.26s)]
*  who is another one of my business partners, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=622.26s)]
*  and Cornelia Stoible, she's with four active partners. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=624.26s)]
*  And it was quite clearly a success right from the word go. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=629.26s)]
*  I didn't know how big a success, but I remember the first Saturday after we've opened, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=636.26s)]
*  so I think we opened on a weekday, but on the Saturday there was a massive queue [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=641.26s)]
*  around the corner of people that really wanted to try our food, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=645.26s)]
*  the cakes that we made and the salads and everything that we made. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=648.26s)]
*  And it was obviously before social media or any of those ways of spreading the word out. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=652.26s)]
*  So it was very much a word of mouth kind of thing. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=659.26s)]
*  And there was a ton of people wanting to come and try the food, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=662.26s)]
*  and it all happened quite organically, and I was very shocked, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=666.26s)]
*  but also very ill-equipped to deal with that. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=669.26s)]
*  So we just ran out of food and the sales assistants started crying [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=672.26s)]
*  because the customers were rude, and we obviously had no idea what we were doing. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=676.26s)]
*  It was a good trauma to have. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=680.26s)]
*  It was a little bit traumatic because we were very unprepared for this moment. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=682.26s)]
*  And in 2006, I started writing for the Guardian newspaper in London, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=686.26s)]
*  and I think then it became more of a phenomenon. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=691.26s)]
*  Rather than just being a local shop in Alton Hill that the local knows, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=697.26s)]
*  it became more national and then global through my column in the Guardian, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=701.26s)]
*  which was literally a very small column at the time. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=706.26s)]
*  It was one tiny recipe with a small picture, but it had a certain impact, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=708.26s)]
*  and it became clear that there was something there. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=715.26s)]
*  And when you wrote your first cookbook off the back of that Guardian column, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=719.26s)]
*  which was Otolengi, what did you want it to be? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=726.26s)]
*  Did you have a kind of clear vision of what you were trying to do with the cookbook? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=730.26s)]
*  No. So the book, the Otolengi cookbook, it came out in 2008, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=735.26s)]
*  and Sammy and I wanted to share with the world the recipes that we were selling in our shops. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=740.26s)]
*  And my agent Felicity Rubinstein, who lived around the corner, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=749.26s)]
*  used to get all her meals from us right from the start. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=754.26s)]
*  And she said, like, you guys should write a book because this is the food that people would love to cook at home. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=758.26s)]
*  She said that quite before the book was published, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=763.26s)]
*  but we, no one was actually quite arrogant and said, oh, but it can't be a conventional cookbook. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=765.26s)]
*  It needs to be very special. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=771.26s)]
*  And so for about two years we were thinking of how to write a cookbook without recipes and without food in it. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=773.26s)]
*  We had all sorts of weird ideas. It sounds very presumptuous. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=780.26s)]
*  But she was pushing for a normal cookbook. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=784.26s)]
*  With actual recipes that people could follow. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=788.26s)]
*  And then I had the garden column, and then immediately there was quite a lot of interest from different publishers [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=791.26s)]
*  to publish a cookbook of the recipes from the deli, from our cafe in London. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=798.26s)]
*  And it was pretty special in the sense that people realized that there is this, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=805.26s)]
*  some kind of magic going on with the cakes and pastries and the salads that were kind of mirroring each other [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=811.26s)]
*  and were presented in a, it had a visual language that people haven't seen before. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=817.26s)]
*  The vertical presentation of food, very fresh food with lots of flavors and really kind of quite dramatically, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=823.26s)]
*  dramatic to the eye but also to the palate with all the herbs and spices. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=832.26s)]
*  And we published the book, but it was only going to be one book because it was going to be the book [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=838.26s)]
*  in which we give the world the recipes for the food that we sell. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=844.26s)]
*  But it was so popular that then publishing became a thing. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=849.26s)]
*  So rather than just being a book to sell and share, the publishing arm of Art Sillengi became, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=854.26s)]
*  the dog was wagging the tail in this respect. The books became the main thing almost. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=861.26s)]
*  Do you have a favorite? I mean, that's probably like choosing a favorite child, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=868.26s)]
*  but do you have a book of yours that you think is that's it, that's what Art Sillengi is? At its very best? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=872.26s)]
*  I'm kind of tempted to say Jerusalem because it tells the story of Sammy and myself and our upbringing and background. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=881.26s)]
*  There's a lovely bit in the introduction and I'm going to butcher it, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=892.26s)]
*  but you write about breaking bread together and you say, you know, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=896.26s)]
*  we're not naive enough to think that this is going to be the solutions to problems, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=903.26s)]
*  but there is something about community and breaking bread together. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=906.26s)]
*  Do you think that accounts in part for how incredibly successful and popular you've become with your books, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=909.26s)]
*  with your cafes? And I do hope you're going to open one in Washington soon where I live. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=917.26s)]
*  But just with everything that you're doing, do you think there is something in the more fragmented and isolated we become, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=922.26s)]
*  the more we want to get back to doing something so? [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=928.26s)]
*  I can't take credit for any of this. I would say that the restaurants, cafes, cookbooks, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=932.26s)]
*  all those places that we go to, an object that we go to to eat and make food, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=941.26s)]
*  have really changed quite a lot over the last 15 years. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=948.26s)]
*  Rather than pushing us to explore new grounds and turning us into competitive sports people around food, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=952.26s)]
*  they're actually taking us in and offering us something which is much more comfortable and joyful than they used to be. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=962.26s)]
*  So the big heavy coffee table books that show you a piece of world that is never going to be yours, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=969.26s)]
*  that you can aspire to, or the restaurants where you've got a million courses coming your way [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=975.26s)]
*  and you never even look at your clock and say, when can I run out of these? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=980.26s)]
*  I think these are much less representative of the world we live in. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=984.26s)]
*  I think people are going into restaurants and into their own kitchens in order to find things that are much more familiar, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=990.26s)]
*  much more comforting, much more easy to digest. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=996.26s)]
*  The big dinner party turned from me trying Vietnamese food on you whilst having no clue how to make Vietnamese food [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1000.26s)]
*  into a big bowl of pasta that is familiar to you and familiar to me [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1009.26s)]
*  and we can just sit around and relax without pushing ourselves to these limits of human ability. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1013.26s)]
*  It didn't have to be the Olympics of cooking every dinner party, did it? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1019.26s)]
*  No, no it doesn't. I think people like home style cooking and family style serving are way more popular now [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1022.26s)]
*  than they used to be. I really put that down to, first of all cost of living, but also Covid [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1029.26s)]
*  and that moment we understood that actually food should be healing rather than just one of all those other activities [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1036.26s)]
*  that we do all day long that pushes us, like going to the gym, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1043.26s)]
*  or whether we try to measure ourselves against this impossible standard of living that is just frustrating [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1046.26s)]
*  and never quite fulfills. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1054.26s)]
*  That's interesting, because actually if I look at your books, do you feel you've reflected that trend, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1056.26s)]
*  starting with Simple I guess, which was almost like a plea from all of us. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1062.26s)]
*  We love your books, Jotam, but please give us something that we can actually cook a little bit more simply and quickly [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1066.26s)]
*  and for our kids. And you've reflected that a bit in your books. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1072.26s)]
*  Yeah, no, I read, you know, I read… [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1077.26s)]
*  Simple, comfort. You're telling us the story. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1080.26s)]
*  I read the messages and I read, when nobody looks, I also read the vicious comments of the Guardian, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1083.26s)]
*  reader's comments, and I know that I have a reputation of someone that makes you go very far, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1089.26s)]
*  stores out your ingredients and then leaves you with a whole pile of dishes to wash the following day. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1095.26s)]
*  I'm totally aware of that. And Simple was either conscious or a subconscious attempt to kind of prove [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1100.26s)]
*  that you can get quite a lot of flavor, complexity, with much less work and fewer ingredients [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1109.26s)]
*  and less time spent in the kitchen. And I think it was a success. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1115.26s)]
*  Some people told me that it was a success because they said, you know, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1119.26s)]
*  finally I can cook this food with more ease and I completely take that. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1123.26s)]
*  And I think since Simple, I have been spending more of my time thinking, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1129.26s)]
*  what does it actually mean to cook this recipe? You know, when does one cook it? [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1135.26s)]
*  How much effort goes into it? And now I find myself, funnily, from a grand old age, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1141.26s)]
*  talking to younger chefs and say to them, is someone actually going to cook this? [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1148.26s)]
*  You know, I ask this question, who is going to cook this? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1153.26s)]
*  Because they bring up all these ingredients, they bring it to the table, and there's a bit of this, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1156.26s)]
*  there's a bit of that, mostly with restaurant chefs that spend a lot of time impressing. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1160.26s)]
*  And I said, like, that's all fine, it's delicious, but who on earth is going to cook this? [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1165.26s)]
*  And I think this is a very valid question to ask because I just want to be understood. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1170.26s)]
*  I wanted people to cook my food. I don't want the recipe to sit there and nobody thinks that that's relevant to it. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1175.26s)]
*  It will become a competition. Because in a way that defeats the whole point of the joy of cooking [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1183.26s)]
*  for friends and family, if you're feeling like you're on display. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1188.26s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with a bit of a competitive edge, but when it's all about a competition, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1192.26s)]
*  then it induces anxiety. And anxiety is something we have way too much of in our world. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1197.26s)]
*  There's just too much anxiety. And there's no need for it, because food really is one of those activities [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1204.26s)]
*  that shouldn't induce anxiety. It's as simple as that. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1210.26s)]
*  This looks beautiful. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1218.26s)]
*  It does look beautiful. It looks great. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1223.26s)]
*  So what do we have? [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1225.26s)]
*  So there's kind of different influences, and I just wanted to capture all those influences here. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1227.26s)]
*  So for example, coconut milk, it's a core cooking element when you create a curry. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1231.26s)]
*  Another one, the chickpeas. So you could use jarred or canned chickpeas, no problem at all. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1237.26s)]
*  And I have a recipe in one of the Test Kitchen cookbooks, which is just slow cooked chickpeas. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1243.26s)]
*  They come out of a jar with some tomatoes, ginger, garlic, and everything goes into a Dutch oven, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1250.26s)]
*  goes on the top, and you take it off after a couple of hours, and you get this whiff of incredible flavors. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1256.26s)]
*  And you've done absolutely no cooking. You just threw things in. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1262.26s)]
*  And for that, like using thin chickpeas, not a problem at all. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1266.26s)]
*  Curry leaves are really, really important. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1269.26s)]
*  So this is totally new to me. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1271.26s)]
*  So just take it and smell it. No, crush it a bit though. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1273.26s)]
*  You know you've become an adjective. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1277.26s)]
*  I'm sure. Well, yes, I do know that. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1281.26s)]
*  Does it still feel strange? I mean, like I go to dinners and people say, oh, that's very Otto Lenke. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1284.26s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, it's very weird because at the end of the day, it's just, I'm just me. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1289.26s)]
*  And it doesn't really matter to me. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1296.26s)]
*  But I'm also very much aware that people have been getting a lot of joy from the food that I've published over the years. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1299.26s)]
*  But in actual fact, I think it's all about what people do at home that really matters to me. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1309.26s)]
*  So the biggest compliment that I can get is if someone comes to me and says, you know, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1315.26s)]
*  this recipe is a permanent feature in my kitchen and even if the next generation says that, that's even better. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1320.26s)]
*  So my kids cook them cook at that now for themselves because that because, you know, books comes come and go. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1327.26s)]
*  Newspaper articles come and go. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1333.26s)]
*  But if there's a recipe that stays within a family, that's like forever. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1335.26s)]
*  And that is the biggest gift that I can be getting. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1339.26s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you very much. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1344.26s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1346.26s)]
*  You [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGO70VQEbDA&t=1376.26s)]
