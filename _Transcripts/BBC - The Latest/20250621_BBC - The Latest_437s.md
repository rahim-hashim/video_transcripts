# US weather warnings as heat dome triggers alerts for millions of Americans | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys)
*  Now millions of Americans have been warned to prepare for extreme temperatures. A heat [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=0.0s)]
*  dome is already smothering the Midwest and is expected to expand to much of the rest of the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=5.12s)]
*  country over the coming days. We'll have more on that in a moment from Michael Mann, Professor of [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=10.24s)]
*  Earth and Environmental Science at the University of Pennsylvania. But Spain and France have also [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=15.36s)]
*  seen roaring temperatures and temperatures in Paris are above 30 degrees Celsius with the French [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=20.64s)]
*  weather agency reporting the country is experiencing a heat wave there and an amber [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=26.56s)]
*  heat health alert will remain in force in England until Monday as temperatures are forecast to be [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=31.2s)]
*  about 10 degrees above average for this time of year. In fact our colleagues at BBC Weather have [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=35.92s)]
*  said that a place called Charlewood in Surrey has reached 32.6 degrees making it to the UK and [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=40.96s)]
*  England's warmest day of the year so far. Well the Met Office has also issued separate warnings for [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=47.12s)]
*  thunderstorms over this weekend. Sam Harrison reports. It's not often the longest day of the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=53.12s)]
*  year and the hottest day of the year so far collide but thousands were out celebrating solstice [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=59.68s)]
*  at Stonehenge this morning enjoying the early heat after overnight temperatures remained high. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=66.0s)]
*  It's beautiful, sunrise is beautiful, it's picture perfect. You stand in front of these stones and [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  you feel that weight of history thousands of years people have been gathering and it's [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=78.72s)]
*  incredibly special. Throughout the day temperatures have risen. These swimmers in Hampstead Heath [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=83.52s)]
*  taking advantage of the cool water as the intense heat kicks in. Some areas in the southeast of [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=89.28s)]
*  England could reach 34 degrees Celsius triggering an amber heat warning and signaling a rise in [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=95.6s)]
*  demand for health services. Areas like this are experiencing the height of this heat wave with [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=102.96s)]
*  people encouraged to enjoy this sun in a responsible manner but this amber alert isn't the only warning [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=109.19999999999999s)]
*  in play today with some areas of the country experiencing extreme variations in weather. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=116.0s)]
*  The sunshine might be blistering for people now but thunderstorms could roll in with the hot [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=122.56s)]
*  conditions. A yellow storm warning is in place for northern England, North Wales and southern [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=128.72s)]
*  Scotland with flash flooding and intense lightning spells possible. You might expect to see thunderstorms [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=134.24s)]
*  where temperatures are highest but what's happening is before things start to change in our weather [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=140.56s)]
*  we've got an area of low pressure closing by and that's changing the atmosphere a little bit [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=144.8s)]
*  across some northern and western areas and that combining with the heat and humidity they have [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=148.88s)]
*  are why it's these areas seeing the storms and not the areas they see in the highest temperatures. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=152.96s)]
*  A mixed bag of warnings then with intense heat on the cards the scorching summer weather continues. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=157.44s)]
*  Sam Harrison, BPC News. Well let's speak to Michael Mann, Presidential Distinguished Professor of [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  Earth and Environmental Science at the University of Pennsylvania. Thank you for being with us. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=169.84s)]
*  What is causing first of all the heat dome in the United States and what exactly is a heat dome? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=174.96s)]
*  Yeah a heat dome is an area of deep high pressure not just at the surface but all the way up through [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=181.36s)]
*  the atmosphere and it's associated with descending very hot dry air and so when you get sort of a [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=188.96s)]
*  wiggles those wiggles those meanders in the jet stream the sort of the troughs or the low pressure [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=197.52s)]
*  areas and the ridges are the high pressure areas and a heat dome is just a very intense ridge in [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=204.16000000000003s)]
*  the atmosphere. We tend to see these in the summer but often what happens and we're seeing that right [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=211.68s)]
*  now is that those wiggles in the jet stream not only do they get high in amplitude so you get a [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=217.76000000000002s)]
*  big ridge you get a heat dome but it remains locked in place like we're seeing right now in [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=223.52s)]
*  Europe the UK and like we're seeing here in North America and we think climate change is actually [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=229.36s)]
*  favouring that sort of configuration in the atmosphere. So the heat in the US and Europe [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=235.44000000000003s)]
*  is all linked is that right? Yeah it's part of a large scale wave pattern in the atmosphere [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=241.12s)]
*  and that large scale wave pattern is becoming more common with each summer in fact we just [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=247.04000000000002s)]
*  published a study a week ago in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences showing [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=253.52s)]
*  that there has been a tripling in the frequency of these sorts of events from about one per summer [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=259.36s)]
*  in the northern hemisphere 70 years ago to now about three of these per summer on average. And [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=265.76s)]
*  if we continue with carbon emissions as they are what is likely to be the forecast for these [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  temperature rises over the coming years is it possible to say that? Yeah and so there are sort [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=278.48s)]
*  of two important pieces here one is pretty simple you make the planet hotter you're going to have [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=283.44s)]
*  more frequent and intense heat extremes. Climate models capture that very well they predict that [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=288.32s)]
*  to happen we're seeing that happen but there's another phenomenon as I alluded to that's also [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=293.84s)]
*  at work and it's these patterns in the jet stream and what our work shows is that the pattern of [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=299.04s)]
*  warming where we're seeing more warming in the Arctic than we are seeing at lower latitudes that [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=304.48s)]
*  changes the temperature difference from the middle latitudes to the Arctic region and that influences [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=308.8s)]
*  the behavior of the jet stream and under certain conditions the jet stream will get locked into one [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=314.64s)]
*  of those very stable wiggly patterns and that's becoming more common it's an ingredient that isn't [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=319.12s)]
*  well captured in the climate models so if anything what this tells us is that we could be in store [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=324.88s)]
*  for even more frequent heat extremes of this sort and even worse heat extremes if we continue to [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=330.64s)]
*  warm the planet. And can you just give us a sense of how high temperatures could go in the US and [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=337.28s)]
*  Europe for example? Well you know what some of the model simulations and again they don't capture [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=342.16s)]
*  all of the relevant mechanisms so these might be underestimates but you can think of sort of the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=349.76000000000005s)]
*  hottest day that you've ever experienced in the UK you know like a 40 degree celsius day that would [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=354.48s)]
*  be a record in any year. That sort of extreme could become commonplace where we might see dozens of [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=362.32000000000005s)]
*  those sorts of days over the course of a typical summer in the future decades from now again if we [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=369.84s)]
*  continue to burn fossil fuels and we continue to warm the planet the good news here is that if we [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=375.91999999999996s)]
*  stop burning fossil fuels if we transition away from fossil fuel burning we can stop the warming [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=380.96s)]
*  of the surface of the planet and the exacerbation of these sorts of weather extremes. And we're [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=386.79999999999995s)]
*  seeing even higher temperatures of course in in parts of Asia and Africa what's the forecast there? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=391.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah well again these these large scale patterns mean that we see extremes [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=396.08s)]
*  simultaneously in different parts of the world across the northern hemisphere so you might have [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=402.56s)]
*  a ridge in the you know one of these heat domes in North America another one in the UK but somewhere [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=408.71999999999997s)]
*  else you know in Africa in Asia you might see the flip side of that a deep trough a low pressure [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=414.79999999999995s)]
*  centre associated with extreme flooding and both of those sorts of extremes are becoming [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=420.4s)]
*  more common again as we continue to warm the planet. Michael Mann I wish we had a bit more time [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=426.15999999999997s)]
*  but thank you so much really grateful to you for your expertise thank you. Thank you. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d87y_gZUSys&t=432.24s)]
