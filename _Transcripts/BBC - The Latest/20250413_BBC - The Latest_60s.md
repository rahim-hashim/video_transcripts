# The Last Of Us Bella Ramsey: 'I'm really glad I'm autistic'. #TheLastOfUs #BBCNews
**BBC - The Latest:** [April 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXI2Y_5l_MU)
*  I said that I was neurodiverse before and then I was like, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXI2Y_5l_MU&t=0.0s)]
*  why don't I just say what it actually is, which is yeah, I'm autistic. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXI2Y_5l_MU&t=2.48s)]
*  And it's something that I'm really glad about just for myself. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXI2Y_5l_MU&t=5.72s)]
*  It sort of allows me to be a bit more free. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXI2Y_5l_MU&t=11.6s)]
*  And also, yes, hopefully inspiring to people to see that you can be in industries like this [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXI2Y_5l_MU&t=13.6s)]
*  and openly say that you're autistic. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXI2Y_5l_MU&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  Like, why there shouldn't be such a stigma around that and such a fear around that. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXI2Y_5l_MU&t=21.28s)]
*  Yeah, so I'm very proud to be able to say it out loud. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXI2Y_5l_MU&t=27.240000000000002s)]
*  And also just to bring more awareness to that autism comes in all different shapes and sizes. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXI2Y_5l_MU&t=32.4s)]
*  That's why it's like a spectrum. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXI2Y_5l_MU&t=36.88s)]
*  And I'm not someone that people would maybe typically see and go like, oh, you're autistic. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXI2Y_5l_MU&t=38.4s)]
*  And there's been people who have believed me when I've told them. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXI2Y_5l_MU&t=44.84s)]
*  And so I think it's just important that people see that it really is a spectrum [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXI2Y_5l_MU&t=46.96s)]
*  and that people like me can also be autistic and that my experience is just as valid as other people's. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXI2Y_5l_MU&t=50.72s)]
