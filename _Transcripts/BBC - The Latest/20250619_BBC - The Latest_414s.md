Video Description: US President Donald Trump has approved plans to attack Iran, but has not made a final decision on whether to strike the country, the BBC's US partner CBS reports.
 
The US president held off from initiating strikes in case Iran agreed to abandon its nuclear programme, a senior intelligence source told CBS.
 
Trump is reportedly considering a US strike on Fordo, an underground uranium enrichment facility in Iran.
 
Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Wednesday rejected Trump's demand for unconditional surrender.

# Donald Trump approves plans to attack Iran, CBS reports | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU)
*  President Trump has approved plans for America to join Israel's attacks on Iran, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=0.0s)]
*  but is said to still be making a final decision on whether to go ahead with that. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=5.12s)]
*  Well, the BBC's US partner, CBS News, says it's been told by two sources that the US [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=10.4s)]
*  president is waiting to see if Tehran agrees to abandon its nuclear programme. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  Well, I've been speaking to CBS News correspondent Jared Hill to get the latest developments from [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=20.56s)]
*  the US. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=25.6s)]
*  And about that, and so we still don't know what the truth is there. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=55.6s)]
*  The Iranians are also saying that they don't plan on surrendering. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  The other factor here that we've learned is that President Trump is potentially waiting [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=62.08s)]
*  for more US military assets to arrive in the region before he makes a decision on whether [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=66.48s)]
*  there will be some type of physical strike on Iran. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=71.2s)]
*  We have seen some efforts from some Republican and Democratic lawmakers here in the US on [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=75.6s)]
*  Capitol Hill in Washington weighing whether they should push through a bill or a law that [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=82.24s)]
*  would prevent President Trump from acting on Iran without the approval of Congress. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=88.0s)]
*  That is in the early stages right now, but all of this showcases just how divisive this issue is [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=93.28s)]
*  here in the States. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=98.88s)]
*  Indeed, and perhaps even divisive in his government, Jared, because we heard a couple [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=100.16s)]
*  of months ago from Tulsi Gabbard who said something quite different in terms of how ready [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=104.96s)]
*  Iran was in terms of nuclear capabilities. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=110.88s)]
*  That's right. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=114.39999999999999s)]
*  The argument here is that all of this is happening because Iran, the argument again is Iran is [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=115.44s)]
*  incredibly close to enriching enough uranium to have a nuclear weapon. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=121.6s)]
*  What we heard from Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence just in March, was that [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=126.88s)]
*  the assessment was that Iran was not close to having a nuclear weapon. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=132.32s)]
*  President Trump a couple of days ago said he doesn't care what Tulsi Gabbard said. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=136.32000000000002s)]
*  He believes based on his current knowledge or intuition that they are close to having [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=140.48000000000002s)]
*  a nuclear weapon. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  So there is that division within the Trump administration itself on the intel. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=148.8s)]
*  Well, that's Jared Hill with the view from the United States as President Trump decides [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=154.56s)]
*  whether or not to join Israel in its military action. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=159.76000000000002s)]
*  We are getting some response on Iranian state media from Iran's deputy foreign minister [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=163.76s)]
*  who said if the US wants to actively intervene in support of Israel, Iran will have no other [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=169.44s)]
*  option but to use its tools to teach aggressors a lesson and defend itself. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=175.6s)]
*  Well, as efforts to de-escalate the tensions continue, the British Foreign Secretary David [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=181.44s)]
*  Lammy is going to be meeting his US counterpart Marco Rubio in Washington today. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=187.6s)]
*  Well earlier I was speaking to our political correspondent Joe Pike in Westminster [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=192.88000000000002s)]
*  to get more of a sense of the UK's position on all of this. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=197.60000000000002s)]
*  The UK's position is evolving and evolving because the key message of escalation we've [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=203.68s)]
*  heard from UK government ministers does not seem to be being heeded in the White House. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=209.60000000000002s)]
*  David Lammy meeting Marco Rubio today and other key contacts in Washington DC we're told. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=214.88000000000002s)]
*  There has been some tension in the relations between the two countries over the UK's decision [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=222.16s)]
*  with some other nations like Australia and Canada to sanction to Israeli ministers in [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=227.6s)]
*  connection to their comments on Gaza. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=234.16s)]
*  Now the UK's position has two key question marks around it. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=237.6s)]
*  Firstly, over what the US ask to the UK might be if there is intervention. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=242.32s)]
*  How could the UK be involved? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=247.44s)]
*  A lot of speculation around the UK military base at Diego Garcia, that's in the Chagos [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=249.2s)]
*  Islands in the centre of the Indian Ocean because that's where it's certainly possible [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=255.2s)]
*  that American B2 stealth bombers could launch from if they are to take action in Iran. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=259.03999999999996s)]
*  Another possibility of course is the UK does what it did last October which is shoot down [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=266.08s)]
*  missiles being fired from Iran towards Israel. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=271.12s)]
*  The second big question mark for the UK government really is around the legal advice and certainly [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=275.44s)]
*  echoes of the legal advice and the debates over legal advice around the Iraq war 22 years [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=280.72s)]
*  ago. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=287.04s)]
*  Suddenly the Attorney General who is not a particularly prominent figure in UK politics [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=288.04s)]
*  comes to the fore again in these sorts of discussions. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=292.56s)]
*  Richard Herb is the Attorney General and his legal advice around different roles for the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=297.28000000000003s)]
*  UK government will be fascinating. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=302.52000000000004s)]
*  I think it's definitely worth making Virginia and that is around how people are feeling [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=304.32s)]
*  in the UK government, in particular in the Foreign Office. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=314.64s)]
*  Diplomats do seem definitely anxious, not just anxious about avoiding an escalation [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=318.36s)]
*  in the Middle East but also maintaining what so far seems to be a pretty positive relationship [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=324.24s)]
*  between President Trump and Prime Minister Stammer. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=329.68s)]
*  There are UK diplomats and government sources within number 10 who believe they've really [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=333.16s)]
*  aced the first six months of the Trump presidency. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=337.6s)]
*  They point to this UK-US trade agreement which is limited, it's not all enacted but it has, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=340.6s)]
*  they argue, tangibly improved the access to the US markets of some UK companies and the [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=347.48s)]
*  UK got to the head of the queue with that. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=355.44000000000005s)]
*  And therefore there is this anxiety that that relationship between Stammer and Trump, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=358.44s)]
*  between number 10 and the White House, between the UK and the US, is maintained whatever [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=364.6s)]
*  Donald Trump decides to do in the coming hours and days. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=369.54s)]
*  Well that's Joe Pike in Westminster there. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=372.56s)]
*  A short while ago we brought you reports that foreign ministers from the UK, Germany, France [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=375.64s)]
*  and the EU were planning to meet in Geneva on Friday to have talks to de-escalate the [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=383.44s)]
*  situation. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=389.92s)]
*  They were planning to meet Iran. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=390.92s)]
*  Well that's now been confirmed according to Iranian state media. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=392.88s)]
*  Iran's foreign minister Abbas Aradji confirming that there will be a meeting between him and [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=396.88s)]
*  European counterparts in Geneva. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=402.72s)]
*  So of course efforts to de-escalate the situation continuing and that is of course significant [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=405.8s)]
*  because it's European leaders meeting with Iran. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zx5pOSLUU&t=410.8s)]
