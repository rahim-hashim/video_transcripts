# Anti-Trump protests take place across US as tariffs come into force | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [April 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8)
*  One of President Trump's most senior advisers has expressed his hope for a zero tariff situation [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=0.0s)]

*  tariffs start to take effect. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=11.76s)]
*  Speaking via VideoLink at a political gathering in Italy, Elon Musk said he could see a future [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  where there was a free trade zone between the two economies. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  As it stands, the EU will have to pay a 20% levy on all imports into the US. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=23.14s)]
*  World leaders have continued to react to the new economic order with the British Prime [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=29.2s)]
*  Minister Sir Keir Starmer and the French President Emmanuel Macron promising to coordinate their [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=33.4s)]
*  positions on any retaliatory action. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=39.08s)]
*  Meanwhile, tens of thousands of people have marched in dozens of US cities in protest [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=42.28s)]
*  against Donald Trump and his policies since his return to the White House. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=47.72s)]
*  I'm joined now by Peter Draper, the Executive Director for the Institute for International [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=52.0s)]
*  Trade at Adelaide University. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=57.88s)]
*  Peter, thank you very much for joining us here on BBC News. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=60.56s)]
*  Australia itself has been hit with baseline tariffs of 10%. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=66.64s)]
*  The Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, said the nation wouldn't introduce its own tariffs [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=72.72s)]
*  in return. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=77.28s)]
*  So what do you make of the position that Australia finds itself in now? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=78.78s)]
*  I think it's the correct decision that the Prime Minister has taken. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=83.64s)]
*  Imposing our own tariffs would amount to self-harm, and that's the basic position the government [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=88.47999999999999s)]
*  has taken. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=94.0s)]
*  And retaliating against the United States would invite further retaliations. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=95.47999999999999s)]
*  And trying to cut some sort of special deal would be a deal with an administration that [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=100.72s)]
*  essentially can't be trusted. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=106.25999999999999s)]
*  So there's really no good options here. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=108.16s)]
*  And what the government is doing is to double down on its diversification strategies, which [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=110.88s)]
*  have been in place for some time, while at the same time putting in place policies to [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=116.32s)]
*  build economic and trade resilience. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=122.0s)]
*  So I think a pretty comprehensive response and quite a defensible one. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=124.8s)]
*  Because Australia quite often has to navigate between its ally, the US, and the regional [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=130.32s)]
*  power of China. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=136.35999999999999s)]
*  So how are they going to strike the balance best for the country of Australia? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=138.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's always a balancing act. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=144.0s)]
*  And one should recall that a couple of years ago, China also co-ost Australia. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=146.88s)]
*  And at that time, about 40% of our exports went to China. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=152.83999999999997s)]
*  To put that into perspective, about 5% of our exports go to the United States. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=157.12s)]
*  So we're far less exposed to the US market. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=162.04s)]
*  And we can therefore, outside of a few sector and product stories, particularly beef exports [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=164.64s)]
*  to the US, we can take the hit, relatively speaking. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=172.04s)]
*  In the case of China, when they co-ost us, we opted again to just double down and take [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=175.83999999999997s)]
*  the hit and diversify. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  And that's what most commodity exporters particularly were able to do. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=183.11999999999998s)]
*  But the bottom line, I think, on the foreign policy front is that this Trump initiative [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=189.04s)]
*  draws the region, generally speaking, closer to China. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=195.16s)]
*  This is a golden opportunity for China to cement its regional relationships and displace [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=198.72s)]
*  the United States and the region. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=203.92s)]
*  And what of the relationship between Australia and the United States? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=206.48s)]
*  The two countries have been allies for years. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=210.23999999999998s)]
*  How concerned are you about the relationship as we move forward? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=213.28s)]
*  We're equally concerned, I would say. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=218.95999999999998s)]
*  So, yes, we are a key US security ally in the region. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=220.76s)]
*  We're not the only one, of course. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=225.2s)]
*  Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, all are equally concerned. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=226.95999999999998s)]
*  And reading the Washington tea leaves with growing alarm, and particularly the growing [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=232.39999999999998s)]
*  influence of the MAGA right in US foreign policymaking, within which the isolationist [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=237.83999999999997s)]
*  trend, I think, is increasingly evident. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=244.23999999999998s)]
*  What would that mean for Australia's security settings going forward? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=247.56s)]
*  Well, there's a very famous Australian book that I'm re-reading at the moment called [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=251.08s)]
*  Fear of Abandonment. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=256.48s)]
*  And I think that it is moving very much to the fore. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=258.8s)]
*  We are very exposed and very concerned about it. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=262.08s)]
*  Peter, thank you very much. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=265.24s)]
*  Fear of Abandonment. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=267.16s)]
*  I will look that up. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=268.16s)]
*  That's Peter Draper, the executive director for the Institute of International Trade at [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=269.72s)]
*  Adelaide University. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=273.72s)]
*  President Trump's tariffs will affect many countries, including Scotland, which has a [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=277.44s)]
*  long history of exporting products like whisky and salmon. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=281.56s)]
*  But will American consumers continue to buy those luxuries after the prices go up? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=285.47999999999996s)]
*  Our reporter David Wallace-Lockhart has been speaking to people in New York to find out. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=291.03999999999996s)]
*  New York City is a few hours from Washington, DC, but the shock waves of Trump's tariff [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=297.2s)]
*  announcement have been felt here. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=302.28s)]
*  And the day that we began to make America wealthy again. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=305.0s)]
*  Reciprocal. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=310.4s)]
*  That means they do it to us and we do it to them. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=312.04s)]
*  Very simple. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=315.8s)]
*  Can't get any simpler than that. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=316.8s)]
*  At the Caledonia bar, the 130 Scottish whiskies they stock are likely to increase in cost. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=319.76s)]
*  Geoff Winslow, originally from Greenock, thinks they may have to pivot towards US-produced [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=326.12s)]
*  spirits. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=331.12s)]
*  We'll have to increase our prices, there's no question about that. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=332.12s)]
*  And then, but if the guest, if the bottles, if we don't move through the bottles, then [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=335.92s)]
*  we may just have to increase our American product, American whisky product, rice, bourbon, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=341.72s)]
*  etc. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=346.64s)]
*  And then hopefully that Scottish doesn't become obsolete or extinct. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=347.64s)]
*  The USA is a really important market for Scotland. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=351.32s)]
*  Of course it is. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=354.2s)]
*  It's the biggest economy in the world. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=355.2s)]
*  But a key question is, will tariffs change the behaviour of the consumers who live here? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=357.12s)]
*  It's not just whisky that faces challenges. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=363.08s)]
*  Stephen Wong, a fish wholesaler on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, sells a ton of Scottish [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=365.48s)]
*  salmon a week to Michelin-starred restaurants. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=370.48s)]
*  Costs may go up, but he'll stick with the product. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=373.72s)]
*  We don't produce it or we don't aquaculture it in the United States. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=376.68s)]
*  And a lot of these items are probably, you know, throughout the last 30, 40 years have [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=380.2s)]
*  been from another country. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=386.52s)]
*  We rely on a lot of wild seafood in our cuisine, but for farm stuff, salmon, not quite so much. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=388.36s)]
*  But I understand his logic, but if there are certain things that we produce, I don't mind, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=396.15999999999997s)]
*  but these are certain things that we just don't produce. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=400.88s)]
*  Wherever you move in New York, you don't have to look far to be reminded of Donald Trump [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=403.52s)]
*  and his impact. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=408.12s)]
*  Scottish business figures want to say you're fired to his tariffs. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=409.6s)]
*  Tariffs are always unhelpful when it comes to doing business, but where tariffs are being [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=413.68s)]
*  applied we want them reduced and ultimately removed. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=417.76s)]
*  But if they are to remain in place, then it's our job as chambers of commerce and business [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=421.24s)]
*  to steer our economy through these challenges. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=424.92s)]
*  The Big Apple is already a city of big prices. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=428.6s)]
*  Scottish produce could be about to get even more expensive, a nerve-racking time for those [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=431.72s)]
*  who want to crack this market. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQsnabgmD8&t=436.58s)]
