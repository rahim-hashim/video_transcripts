Video Description: President Donald Trump has announced new import taxes of 25% on cars and car parts coming into the US.
 
Trump said the latest tariffs would come into effect on 2 April, with charges on businesses importing vehicles starting the next day. Taxes on parts are set to start in May or later.
 
The president said the measure would lead to "tremendous growth" for the industry, promising it would spur jobs and investment in the US.
 
But analysts have said the move is likely to lead to the temporary shutdown of significant car production in the US, increase prices, and strain relations with allies.
 
Trump's latest move threatens to upend global car trade and supply chains.

# Donald Trump announces 25% tariffs on car imports to US | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w)
*  President Trump has widened the global trade war he started since retaking the White House. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=0.0s)]
*  He's announced a 25% tariff on all cars imported into the United States from the 2nd of April. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  The U.S. president claimed the measures would spur growth in the U.S. car industry and create jobs [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=13.84s)]
*  and investment. The U.S. imports roughly 8 million cars, that was last year's number, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=19.68s)]
*  accounting for about $240 billion in trade and roughly half of overall sales. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=25.92s)]
*  Mexico is the top foreign supplier of cars to the U.S. followed by South Korea, Japan, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  Canada and Germany. Analysts estimate that 25% tariffs on car parts from Mexico and Canada [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=38.400000000000006s)]
*  could add between $4,000 and $10,000 in costs depending on the vehicle. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=46.160000000000004s)]
*  This will continue to spur growth like you haven't seen before I was elected. We were losing all of [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=52.8s)]
*  our plants that were being built in Mexico and Canada and other places. Now those plants [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=60.4s)]
*  largely have stopped and they're moving them to our country. And Indiana, the great state of Indiana, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=65.2s)]
*  I love Indiana, Honda is building one of the biggest plants anywhere and they've just started. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=71.2s)]
*  They wouldn't have done it without this. In all cases they wouldn't have done it without what [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=79.67999999999999s)]
*  we're doing. Well there's been a response from Europe with the EU promising to protect its workers [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=85.36s)]
*  and consumers. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission said, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=91.52s)]
*  I deeply regret the U.S. decision to impose tariffs on European automotive exports. She went on to [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=96.16s)]
*  say tariffs are taxes, bad for businesses, worse for consumers equally in the U.S. and in the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=103.36s)]
*  European Union. Canada's new Prime Minister Mark Carney called the tariffs a direct attack on [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=110.64s)]
*  Canadian workers and vowed his country would rebound on its own. We will build an all-in-Canada [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=116.4s)]
*  network for auto manufacturing components because on average an auto part crosses that border [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=123.76s)]
*  often through that bridge, over that bridge, six times before final assembly. And in a trade war [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=132.32s)]
*  that's a huge vulnerability. Well let's bring in Rufus Yerzer who's former U.S. trade negotiator [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=140.0s)]
*  and former deputy director general of the World Trade Organization. Welcome to BBC News. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=146.96s)]
*  Thank you, good to be here. So first of all your initial reaction, the impact this will have? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=152.88s)]
*  Well this is really the first major battle of the trade war. We might say the preliminaries are over, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=159.52s)]
*  things seemed on again and off again on many aspects of what Trump was threatening. But now [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=168.08s)]
*  clearly he's determined to go forward. I'm not surprised that he's chosen autos. This has been [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=174.24s)]
*  something he's talked about for a long, long time. But the reason it's so major, this is, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=179.52s)]
*  is a four trillion dollar industry worldwide. It's one of the largest segments of manufacturing [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  and assembly in all of the developed economies of the world. The trade is very vibrant. The U.S. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=194.8s)]
*  imported, as you said, about 240 billion dollars of cars. But this new action extends also to [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=201.76000000000002s)]
*  auto parts and there's about 192 billion more of auto parts that are caught up in this. And of course [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=208.4s)]
*  as you said, the five biggest exporters to the U.S., Mexico, Japan, Korea, Canada, and Germany, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=215.84s)]
*  but also other European countries like the U.K. itself, France, and Italy. And so this is now a [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=224.96s)]
*  trade conflict between the U.S. and its traditional allies and partners, both in free trade and in [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=235.36s)]
*  democracy. Clearly it's going to have major repercussions for the relationships between [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=242.96s)]
*  these countries. I think retaliation of some sort is going to be inevitable. And it's going to have [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=249.68s)]
*  a major impact on these economies as well as the U.S. economy. And we can talk about what those [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  impacts are. Well, I was just going to say, I mean, when press by reporters on whether this was a [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=263.76s)]
*  negotiating tactic, the president said, no, no, no, this is permanent. This will not change. Comes [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=270.08s)]
*  into effect next week. We've seen reaction. We've mentioned from Ursula von der Leyen, from Mark [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=275.76s)]
*  Carney, but also from Japan as well. Interesting, Japan's take on this was we invest so much in the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=282.0s)]
*  U.S. economy where they have factories, et cetera. I mean, that is the long-term goal of the president. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=288.88s)]
*  Will he achieve that more manufacturing in the U.S. growth, more jobs for Americans? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=294.4s)]
*  Well, but it's also going to raise costs significantly for U.S. producers because [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=302.08s)]
*  they depend on global supply chains and a very, very sophisticated network of integrated [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=308.71999999999997s)]
*  production, particularly among the North American partners. So this will have a big impact on Canada [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=316.96s)]
*  and Mexico. And if their economies start taking a downturn, that's bound to have an impact [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=322.32s)]
*  on the U.S. as well. But in terms of, you know, one of the things we're going to see down the road [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=328.32s)]
*  is how much of an inflationary impact will this have? There are estimates now that it will [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=334.08s)]
*  increase the cost of a car in the U.S. Average car is about $50,000. It'll increase that to [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=338.96s)]
*  somewhere close to $60,000. And, you know, just at a time when obviously Americans were expecting [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=345.04s)]
*  their new president to bring down costs. All right. And we've got to leave it there, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=352.88s)]
*  Rufus. Sorry to interrupt you, but we do appreciate your analysis on this. There is so much more to say, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=357.76000000000005s)]
*  though, as you are implying. Rufus, yes, you're there. But if we unpack this further later in [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=363.12s)]
*  business, markets have reacted to this. We've seen car stocks falling in the U.S. and in Asia [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=369.76s)]
*  as well. We'll have more on that later. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B49nczujg9w&t=375.92s)]
