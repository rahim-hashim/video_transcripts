**BBC - The Latest:** [July 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE)
*  I've sent out. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=0.0s)]
*  Disappointment. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=1.44s)]
*  Disappointed. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=2.44s)]
*  Unorganised. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=3.44s)]
*  Rigmatic but tentative. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=4.44s)]
*  Hello everyone, my name is Luke. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=6.76s)]
*  Today we're going to be talking a little bit about what's been happening in politics [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=9.6s)]
*  and getting some of your views on that. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=14.4s)]
*  I've always been a Labour supporter, my parents were Labour, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  and I think as an adult I expected much more from them, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=20.8s)]
*  but I've expected Labour to pull themselves together sufficiently. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=24.36s)]
*  Everything that they promised and said that they were going to do, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=27.44s)]
*  nothing's really come of it as of yet. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=31.68s)]
*  Is there anything particular that they've done that's disappointed? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=34.800000000000004s)]
*  Immigration is a big thing for me. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=37.44s)]
*  I feel like at the moment it's patching things up. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=39.68s)]
*  That's why I look at this first year as not really the year to sort of push the ideologies, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=42.36s)]
*  push those big ideas, it's kind of, let's sort of shore things up, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=48.0s)]
*  let's steady the ship almost. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=51.32s)]
*  I think a lot of things that were promised, even if I voted for them, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=53.6s)]
*  were never going to be possible. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=57.199999999999996s)]
*  I don't think any political party is honest. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=58.96s)]
*  I don't see any kind of difference so far, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=61.16s)]
*  and what I have just come across is like, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=63.239999999999995s)]
*  you know, they blaming the previous party about those kind of things. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=65.44s)]
*  Can we turn to the man in charge, Keir Starmer, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=68.67999999999999s)]
*  and ask about how you think he is performing as Prime Minister? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=72.16s)]
*  I feel that he has a bit of a yes-man at the beginning, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=76.92s)]
*  and has to promise certain things, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=81.0s)]
*  but again, maybe it's too soon to kind of see. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=84.28s)]
*  A little bit more time, he might be able to live up to that. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=88.36s)]
*  My opinion on Keir Starmer... [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=91.56s)]
*  I feel a little bit lied to. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=96.83999999999999s)]
*  He changed, obviously, the winter fuel payment was going to stop. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  Now he's gone back on what... [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=104.6s)]
*  I don't know, I just... [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=107.32s)]
*  I don't have much confidence. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=110.28s)]
*  The more recent, you know, the PIP, changing that, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=112.52000000000001s)]
*  and then what happened, you know, within his own party, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=115.80000000000001s)]
*  that was worrying. Again, another U-turn. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=119.48s)]
*  And because that's more recent, it pushes it either that there is [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=122.24000000000001s)]
*  little direction, I guess. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=125.76s)]
*  Do you have an opinion about Rachel Reeves [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=127.4s)]
*  and how good a job she's doing? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=129.72s)]
*  I think she's trying her best. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=131.52s)]
*  I do think they blame the Conservative [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=133.44s)]
*  for all the problems they're having now, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=136.36s)]
*  but that was always going to be the case. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=138.52s)]
*  Her crying at the Commons the other day, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=141.32s)]
*  and Keir Starmer didn't even notice, but everyone else did. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=143.52s)]
*  And, I know, it was for personal reasons, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=147.72s)]
*  and she should be able to keep that to herself, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=150.28s)]
*  but sometimes I think, is it the pressure getting to her? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=154.04s)]
*  I think, in my personal life, I can't turn anything around [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=158.36s)]
*  in a year that's significant and that is in a mess, right? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=160.56s)]
*  The country's a mess, so we have to give them some time. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=163.96s)]
*  Is there anyone else that you think might be doing a good job [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=167.4s)]
*  right now or could do a good job in that role? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=170.35999999999999s)]
*  I really like Reform. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=173.4s)]
*  And what do you think about their leader? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=175.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I like him. I didn't, but it was I'm a celebrity [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=176.92s)]
*  that turned my head for Nigel, not going to lie. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=180.79999999999998s)]
*  I really saw a different side to him, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=183.68s)]
*  and I think he's very misunderstood. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=185.12s)]
*  I think he's more relatable to the people, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=187.04s)]
*  to the average person. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=188.88s)]
*  Where some politicians at the present seem far removed, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=190.44s)]
*  they're so in another world [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=194.2s)]
*  because they're usually public school educated, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=197.16s)]
*  they can't relate to the average person. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=199.44s)]
*  Nigel Farage was. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=201.36s)]
*  Sorry. Public school. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=203.04s)]
*  Oh, OK. Yeah. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=204.4s)]
*  Whereas actually, Keir Starmer is working class, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=205.32s)]
*  but he does present that. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  So Nigel Farage puts on this image of being one of the people, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=208.64000000000001s)]
*  but actually, he could have even went to private school. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=212.72s)]
*  OK, that's interesting. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=215.0s)]
*  What about, how many of you know who the Conservative party leader is? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=216.52s)]
*  Just a quick show of hands. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=221.28s)]
*  I can't say. I know. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=223.0s)]
*  About Hass? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=225.8s)]
*  I can't say her name. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=227.6s)]
*  I think she's quite argumentative. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=229.2s)]
*  Imagine you are Keir Starmer's employer. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=230.92s)]
*  What would be the sort of one sentence [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=234.56s)]
*  which would sum up your appraisal? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=237.4s)]
*  Keep up, keep up what you're doing, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=240.35999999999999s)]
*  but I feel like you need some direction now [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=242.2s)]
*  because I feel like you're being attacked. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=244.32s)]
*  Try harder or you're going to lose your job. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=246.16s)]
*  I need to see some evidence from now going forward. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=248.35999999999999s)]
*  Show more evidence of your work and communicate better. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=251.84s)]
*  Disappointing. You're fired. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=254.95999999999998s)]
*  You're fired. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIUsMrJG0pE&t=256.8s)]
