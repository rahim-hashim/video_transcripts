**BBC - The Latest:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91uH8IiqbW8)
*  After rejecting a plea deal, the stakes are even higher for Sean Diddy Combs as his criminal trial begins. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91uH8IiqbW8&t=0.0s)]
*  If convicted on the racketeering charge that he used his business to sexually abuse and exploit women, he could face life in prison. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91uH8IiqbW8&t=6.0s)]
*  He says all the sexual encounters were consensual and part of a swinger lifestyle. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91uH8IiqbW8&t=14.0s)]
*  That's why jury selection is so important, and Diddy told the judge that he's feeling a little nervous about it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91uH8IiqbW8&t=19.0s)]
*  Nearly every juror so far has watched news or social media coverage of the case. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91uH8IiqbW8&t=25.0s)]
*  And many have also seen the infamous CCTV footage of Diddy appearing to kick and beat his former partner, the R&B singer Cassie Ventura. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91uH8IiqbW8&t=30.0s)]
*  And underscoring how high profile this trial is going to be, many celebrity names have already been mentioned, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91uH8IiqbW8&t=39.0s)]
*  including the rapper Kid Cudi, who supported Cassie when she made her allegations against Diddy. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91uH8IiqbW8&t=46.0s)]
*  The judge is sussing out the prospective jurors' answers to ensure they can be impartial. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91uH8IiqbW8&t=52.0s)]
*  He'll need 12 jurors and six alternates to sit and hear the evidence and, of course, to try to reach a unanimous verdict. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91uH8IiqbW8&t=57.0s)]
