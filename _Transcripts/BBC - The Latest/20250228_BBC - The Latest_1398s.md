# Actor Derek Jacobi on Shakespeare, luck, and coming out in the 1950s | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0)
*  You're going to be an actor. You're going to be a living son. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=0.0s)]
*  You could become an insurance broker. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=5.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=8.0s)]
*  An accountant. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=9.0s)]
*  An accountant. Oh, that would have been ace. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=10.0s)]
*  Not that we want disparage accountants. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=13.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=15.0s)]
*  Very, very fine accountants. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=16.0s)]
*  Don't stop. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=17.0s)]
*  Derek, you've had one of the most storied careers in acting. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=18.0s)]
*  BAFTAs, Tony, Olivier's, Emmy's, you've been in the Gladiators, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=26.0s)]
*  Nanny McPhee, I, Claudius, of course. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=32.0s)]
*  Are you satisfied? You look back and think I'm good? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=36.0s)]
*  I've done well? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=40.0s)]
*  I have been the luckiest actor you'll ever meet. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=42.0s)]
*  I'm going to talk about that later with you, because I don't think it is all luck, but anyway. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=46.0s)]
*  Well, I've been around for over 60 years, and I've been given so many opportunities, you know, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=51.0s)]
*  and I still enjoy it. I don't think I can do much stage work anymore. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=61.0s)]
*  That's become a bit scary for me. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=69.0s)]
*  The memory. Tricky, the lies? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=73.0s)]
*  Tricky, tricky the memory and the exposure. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=76.0s)]
*  And with a camera, I can stop. I can forget and stop and we can do it again. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=82.0s)]
*  There was no safety in that sort of acting in the theatre. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=88.0s)]
*  It's you and hopefully a couple of thousand of them in a big theatre. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=91.0s)]
*  And that was always a thrill. That was always get up there and really enjoy it. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=98.0s)]
*  The thrill is now turning into terror. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=105.0s)]
*  Yeah, terror is not a good thing. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=109.0s)]
*  Not a good thing. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=111.0s)]
*  But you're still doing, you were just in Gladiator 2. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=112.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=116.0s)]
*  You've done a lot of historical roles, obviously. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=117.0s)]
*  I mean, obviously Shakespeare, Emperor's, Claudius. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=120.0s)]
*  Was there something about inhabiting people from the past that particularly appealed to you, resonated with you? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=123.0s)]
*  I think it happened because I did a lot of the classic roles. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=132.0s)]
*  And in that sense, you get to play kings, princes, emperors. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=140.0s)]
*  And I did a lot of Shakespeare. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=148.0s)]
*  And right from school days, I played Hamlet at school when I was 17. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=151.0s)]
*  And that kind of, I always thought that I was, I wanted to be an actor. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=156.0s)]
*  I had no talent for anything else. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=163.0s)]
*  And Hamlet confirmed it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=166.0s)]
*  Okay, is there a line from Hamlet that particularly today you even remember? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=170.0s)]
*  Oh, I used to be able to remember all of it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=175.0s)]
*  To be or not to be that is the question. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=178.0s)]
*  Whether it is nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows about Raiders 40 or to take arms against the sea of troubles and by opposing end them. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=181.0s)]
*  That's a bit of... [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=194.0s)]
*  Still there. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=196.0s)]
*  It's still there all these years later. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=197.0s)]
*  All the other parts I think have gone. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=200.0s)]
*  Shakespeare stays. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=203.0s)]
*  Shakespeare stays, yes. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=205.0s)]
*  Was there a way you approached your Shakespeare roles? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=207.0s)]
*  I mean, you did take on these great classics and you went into it very much with a mind of doing theatre. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=212.0s)]
*  Would you say you were always going to be a classical actor in the role? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=217.0s)]
*  Does that mean something, being a classical? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=221.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=224.0s)]
*  I'm always wondering whether you kind of became... [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=225.0s)]
*  Derek Jacobi is the classical Shakespearean actor of our generation. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=228.0s)]
*  Is that something you intended to be? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=233.0s)]
*  That never occurred. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=235.0s)]
*  That never occurred, no. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=237.0s)]
*  Actors are players. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=242.0s)]
*  To kind of make an actor special. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=245.0s)]
*  If they can put marks by an actor and... [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=249.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=253.0s)]
*  Actors are... [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=255.0s)]
*  It should be universal. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=257.0s)]
*  There was nothing in my background that was special. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=259.0s)]
*  I was an East End boy. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=264.0s)]
*  I was never called Blimey, but that was my surroundings. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=266.0s)]
*  But somehow I was born to be an actor. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=274.0s)]
*  That's what I feel. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=279.0s)]
*  There was never any alternative. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=281.0s)]
*  That's what I wanted. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=284.0s)]
*  That's what I thought I could do. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=286.0s)]
*  That's what I enjoyed. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=288.0s)]
*  And it was the giving of an actor. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=290.0s)]
*  I can't act on my own. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=294.0s)]
*  I need somebody to act too. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=296.0s)]
*  To hopefully have an impact on your life as an audience. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=299.0s)]
*  That is thrilling. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=305.0s)]
*  That is thrilling. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=307.0s)]
*  Do you think if you had been born in Leytonstone 30, 40 years later, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=308.0s)]
*  when TV and movies were so much more ubiquitous, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=314.0s)]
*  you may not have gone into theatre originally? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=319.0s)]
*  Or was it something about theatre and live performance? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=324.0s)]
*  I think it was... [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=327.0s)]
*  I was very fortunate in that I was born in London. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=329.0s)]
*  So theatre was easily available. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=332.0s)]
*  My parents first took me to theatre when I was about seven. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=335.0s)]
*  The pantomime at the London Gladium. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=340.0s)]
*  The wonderful thing was I was an only child, but they were so supportive. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=344.0s)]
*  But it was a world that they wanted not of. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=349.0s)]
*  They knew nothing about theatre, actors. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=353.0s)]
*  And they had this son who was reasonably clever at school, reasonably academic, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=357.0s)]
*  ended up going to university and all that. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=366.0s)]
*  So they were very chuffed, very proud. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=370.0s)]
*  Not just any university. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=373.0s)]
*  Cambridge at St John's. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=375.0s)]
*  What do you think they expected for you? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=377.0s)]
*  What did they think young Derek was going to become? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=380.0s)]
*  They never... [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=385.0s)]
*  They never mentioned it. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=390.0s)]
*  They never... [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=393.0s)]
*  I thought when I went into the theatre, which was a world they had no knowledge of at all. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=394.0s)]
*  Acting, being an actor. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=401.0s)]
*  But it all changed when I got my first job, which was the Birmingham Rep. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=404.0s)]
*  And I stayed there for three years. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=409.0s)]
*  And they would come up from London to see everything I did. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=412.0s)]
*  They would drive up to Birmingham. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=419.0s)]
*  And they suddenly kind of switched. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=422.0s)]
*  They thought, well, he's enjoying himself. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=426.0s)]
*  He's earning a living. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=429.0s)]
*  What's wrong with that? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=432.0s)]
*  People seem to like him. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=434.0s)]
*  They respond to him. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=437.0s)]
*  Our son's an actor. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=439.0s)]
*  And they were so supportive. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=441.0s)]
*  Because it was a world that was alien to them. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=444.0s)]
*  I'd had a good education. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=449.0s)]
*  I'd been to university. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=452.0s)]
*  And in their heads, the world is your oyster. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=456.0s)]
*  You're going to be an actor. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=462.0s)]
*  There's no steadiness in acting. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=465.0s)]
*  You're going to earn a living, son. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=469.0s)]
*  You could become an insurance broker. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=472.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=474.0s)]
*  An accountant. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=475.0s)]
*  An accountant? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=476.0s)]
*  Oh, well, that would have been the ace. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=477.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=480.0s)]
*  But you're going to go up to Birmingham. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=481.0s)]
*  Not that we want disparate accountants. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=484.0s)]
*  I'm sure there's very, very fine accountants. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=486.0s)]
*  Don't stop. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=488.0s)]
*  It wasn't my scene at all. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=489.0s)]
*  How did it affect you becoming famous? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=491.0s)]
*  I don't think it affected me at all, really. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=494.0s)]
*  Fame is really how you use it. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=501.0s)]
*  And if fame meant more work, fame was good. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=506.0s)]
*  But that's sort of what it meant to me. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=511.0s)]
*  Of course there's a little tingle when somebody says, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=516.0s)]
*  oh, Mr. Jackalby, I saw you in this, and can I have your autograph? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=521.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=525.0s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=526.0s)]
*  But that's all. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=528.0s)]
*  I don't think being an actor inflated me in any way, really. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=529.0s)]
*  Because I knew how difficult it was and how easy it was to muck it up. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=537.0s)]
*  Do you think there's a difference between being an actor who has primarily come from theater [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=542.0s)]
*  and the classics and the stage? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=547.0s)]
*  And I look at young actors today. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=549.0s)]
*  I mean, stars are made in the space of one movie performance. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=552.0s)]
*  And they may not have had very much experience beforehand. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=557.0s)]
*  Do you think those stars could have made it in your world of night after night [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=561.0s)]
*  and three years at the Birmingham Rep? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=568.0s)]
*  Is there a difference? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=570.0s)]
*  And do you look at the quality of the acting side? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=572.0s)]
*  I don't know. Maybe you look at the quality of their acting, think, my God, they're good. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=575.0s)]
*  Or maybe you look at it sometimes and think, oh, my God. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=578.0s)]
*  Yeah, both of those. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=581.0s)]
*  Richie Face. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=582.0s)]
*  Yeah, both of those. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=583.0s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, God, he's handsome. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=584.0s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=586.0s)]
*  He can hardly speak, but he's good looking. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=588.0s)]
*  No, you're actually, you go through a period of, let's call it jealousy. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=593.0s)]
*  But it doesn't stay because you know what a hard world it is [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=601.0s)]
*  and an unforgiving world it is in many senses. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=609.0s)]
*  And a pretty face, a handsome face isn't enough. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=613.0s)]
*  Ultimately is not enough. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=618.0s)]
*  You have to come up with it. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=620.0s)]
*  Not that you don't have a very handsome face, Derek. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=621.0s)]
*  I don't for a minute to be implying that. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=624.0s)]
*  But did you go, I mean, I'm thinking of those young actors who are pretty faces, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=627.0s)]
*  and maybe they'll just disappear. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=631.0s)]
*  And I love the fact that you use the word jealousy, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=633.0s)]
*  because of course we all have some of that jealousy. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=636.0s)]
*  Did you think when you were in your 20s and 30s, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=638.0s)]
*  I could be one of those pretty face actors too? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=643.0s)]
*  Was that your view of yourself? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=646.0s)]
*  Did you think of yourself as a kind of handsome, romantic lead? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=647.0s)]
*  No, no. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=651.0s)]
*  And the proof is in the pudding. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=653.0s)]
*  I wasn't that kind of lead actor. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=656.0s)]
*  I'm not saying that they're no good. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=661.0s)]
*  And in a sense they have a head start, because they're nice to look at. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=665.0s)]
*  And I was lucky that I, at the age of 17, got my first job at the Rep. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=671.0s)]
*  I stayed three years, which I hadn't been to drama school, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=680.0s)]
*  so it was a huge learning experience. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=684.0s)]
*  A new play every four weeks, the three years. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=687.0s)]
*  And then being spotted by Laurence Olivier, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=692.0s)]
*  taken to the National Theatre at the Old Vic when I was 20, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=697.0s)]
*  and staying there for seven years. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=703.0s)]
*  I mean, that was an experience that actors would kill for, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=707.0s)]
*  working with Olivier, Redgrave, Matti Smith, Albert Finney, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=714.0s)]
*  Bob Stevens, all the greats. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=720.0s)]
*  And learning from them and becoming friends with them, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=724.0s)]
*  part of that company, it was amazing. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=729.0s)]
*  So the reason I was asking about how you looked [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=732.0s)]
*  and how you saw yourself physically as an actor, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=736.0s)]
*  was because you have spoken a lot about luck, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=740.0s)]
*  you've written about luck in your life. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=742.0s)]
*  But actually I look at your life, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=744.0s)]
*  and there are some ways in which you could say, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=747.0s)]
*  this was not a lucky actor. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=750.0s)]
*  You have struggled, you were not the pretty face [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=752.0s)]
*  that automatically got you into the Hollywood movies. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=756.0s)]
*  You were gay at a time when it was illegal to be gay. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=761.0s)]
*  You had things you had to overcome. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=764.0s)]
*  And in a way, yes, Laurence Olivier spotted you at the Birmingham Rep, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=767.0s)]
*  but he spotted you because you were damn good. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=771.0s)]
*  Was that luck, really? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=774.0s)]
*  It was, in the fact that he was in the audience. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=776.0s)]
*  He was apparently on a trip around the reps in the country [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=780.0s)]
*  to find the company that he wanted to create at the OV, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=786.0s)]
*  to play the supporting actors. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=792.0s)]
*  And thank God, he picked me and I became, but I'm supporting these people. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=796.0s)]
*  But maybe you'd have become, somebody would have spotted you anyway. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=802.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=806.0s)]
*  With that much talent? Does that much talent go unnoticed? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=808.0s)]
*  I think there's talent, and I think there's luck. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=812.0s)]
*  And without that luck, the talent isn't enough on its own. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=818.0s)]
*  You've got to have the opportunity to just show you've got talent. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=824.0s)]
*  And without that opportunity, you can be as talented as a get-out, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=828.0s)]
*  but nobody's seeing it, nobody's appreciating it. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=833.0s)]
*  You've got to be seen. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=837.0s)]
*  Your gift has got to be acknowledged or whatever. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=839.0s)]
*  I'm still not convinced. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=845.0s)]
*  I still think somebody, you were too good, Derek. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=847.0s)]
*  If he hadn't been in the audience that night, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=851.0s)]
*  somebody else would have been in the audience, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=854.0s)]
*  and somebody would have told him how good you were. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=856.0s)]
*  I don't believe that. I don't believe it. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=858.0s)]
*  I think once you start believing in your own talent, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=862.0s)]
*  rather than welcoming the fact that you are talented, I think that's wrong. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=872.0s)]
*  I think not to believe, oh, God, I'm so good at this. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=880.0s)]
*  No. Thank God I've been given the opportunity to do this, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=885.0s)]
*  and thereby maybe get better. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=892.0s)]
*  But it's a lovely world to be in, and I want to be successful in that world. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=895.0s)]
*  I don't particularly want to be rich, although that would be nice. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=903.0s)]
*  But it is a world that I feel absolutely at ease in, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=907.0s)]
*  and if that's going to be my life, what a wonderful life it's going to be. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=913.0s)]
*  How much of a struggle was it being gay at a time when it was illegal [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=918.0s)]
*  and widely condemned? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=924.0s)]
*  Yes. I didn't struggle, no. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=928.0s)]
*  I've been so lucky. I have been luck, luck, luck. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=933.0s)]
*  I was always, as a boy, I knew that something was, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=938.0s)]
*  it's wrong to say something was wrong, that something was different. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=948.0s)]
*  And I didn't acknowledge it for a long time. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=952.0s)]
*  As a teenager, I had the girlfriends, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=958.0s)]
*  but I knew something was... [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=961.0s)]
*  And you knew what it was? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=964.0s)]
*  I knew exactly what it was. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=966.0s)]
*  I once confronted my mother with the fact and told her... [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=968.0s)]
*  And you were quite young. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=976.0s)]
*  Yes, I was a young teenage, I was about 16, I suppose. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=977.0s)]
*  I said, Mama, I want to talk to you, and I told her. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=983.0s)]
*  And her reaction, God bless her, was, you're 16. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=988.0s)]
*  All boys go through this. You'll grow out of it. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=993.0s)]
*  That was, in a sense, her defense against what she didn't want. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=997.0s)]
*  Well, this was the 1950s. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1007.0s)]
*  Yes, yeah. She went off to dad, I expect, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1011.0s)]
*  and they talked about it. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1015.0s)]
*  But it was never mentioned again, never mentioned again. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1017.0s)]
*  And they accepted it, they totally accepted it. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1021.0s)]
*  It was a time when it was difficult, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1027.0s)]
*  because gay people were persecuted. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1030.0s)]
*  I didn't put it around that I was gay. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1034.0s)]
*  I was very discreet, I suppose. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1039.0s)]
*  I was determined not to let it appear in my head as a disease, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1043.0s)]
*  as something wrong with me. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1052.0s)]
*  I think you're an amazing optimist. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1056.0s)]
*  I think you're very optimistic. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1058.0s)]
*  I was very... I've said it so many times talking to you. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1061.0s)]
*  I was so lucky. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1066.0s)]
*  Oh, God, I didn't know that. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1068.0s)]
*  I didn't really ever face big problems or big obstacles. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1072.0s)]
*  I was lucky. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1080.0s)]
*  You're still acting. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1083.0s)]
*  Thank God. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1085.0s)]
*  Even at the grand old age of... young age. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1087.0s)]
*  87. This is my 87th year. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1091.0s)]
*  What does age bring to an actor? [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1096.0s)]
*  Well, things drop off. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1099.0s)]
*  And you slow down. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1102.0s)]
*  It's more difficult to remember lines. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1107.0s)]
*  Your brain... I used to have a very sharp brain. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1111.0s)]
*  I don't anymore. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1115.0s)]
*  I think that's obviously age. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1117.0s)]
*  Physically, you get aches and pains. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1121.0s)]
*  I haven't, thank goodness, got anything really dangerous. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1123.0s)]
*  I can't see very well out of my right eye. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1130.0s)]
*  But that's all. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1134.0s)]
*  I can still walk, talk. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1135.0s)]
*  Shall I tell you this? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1140.0s)]
*  Only recently, only in the last, I would say, 18 months. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1142.0s)]
*  But I have a lady who I can hear in my ear, who feeds me my lines. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1149.0s)]
*  Now, I know my lines. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1162.0s)]
*  I've studied the part and I know how to say it. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1164.0s)]
*  But in case I dry, which at the age of 87 is much more likely, she's in my ear. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1166.0s)]
*  And I can take her cues and speak the lines. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1176.0s)]
*  I don't know whether I should have told you that. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1182.0s)]
*  I am not the only one. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1185.0s)]
*  I think I'm very grateful to that lady because it keeps you giving your gift to us for longer. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1187.0s)]
*  Well, that's a lovely thing to say. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1193.0s)]
*  But in a way, in my head, it's a default. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1196.0s)]
*  I'm not totally in charge. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1203.0s)]
*  I need assistance. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1208.0s)]
*  It's like a skier wearing a knee brace. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1211.0s)]
*  Yeah, yes. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1213.0s)]
*  Keeps them skiing longer. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1214.0s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1216.0s)]
*  That's a very good analogy. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1217.0s)]
*  Yes, that's true. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1220.0s)]
*  Are there upsides of aging that you bring to your roles or life? [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1222.0s)]
*  I'm very, I have a wonderful partner who, in a sense, I mean, lately has become a looker afterer too, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1229.0s)]
*  for which I am deeply grateful. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1243.0s)]
*  But I can't complain about anything in my life. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1248.0s)]
*  I can't complain about anything in my life. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1254.0s)]
*  I really had a charmed life, really, from being an evacuee as a very young child. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1257.0s)]
*  In the Second World War? [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1271.0s)]
*  In the Second World War. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1274.0s)]
*  I was, when war broke out, I was about four, three, four. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1275.0s)]
*  I was evacuated. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1283.0s)]
*  I had a wonderful time. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1285.0s)]
*  I was evacuated to the country, to a pub. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1286.0s)]
*  I had a year and a half in a pub. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1290.0s)]
*  I wasn't drinking in those days. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1293.0s)]
*  But I had a wonderful time. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1295.0s)]
*  And then I adored school. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1297.0s)]
*  I adored university. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1300.0s)]
*  And I adored theatre. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1303.0s)]
*  Nothing, sort of nothing went wrong. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1306.0s)]
*  I've had a couple of physical accidents, which I, thank God, survived. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1308.0s)]
*  But if anyone could say they have had a charmed life, and if I don't fall off this chair dead for saying it, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1316.0s)]
*  I have had a charmed life. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1327.0s)]
*  In all respects, in my middle years, I found a partner with whom I'd been for nearly 50 years. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1330.0s)]
*  Yes, I can't complain about anything. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1341.0s)]
*  Derek, thank you very much. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1346.0s)]
*  Pleasure. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1348.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1349.0s)]
*  Bless you. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1350.0s)]
*  That was lovely. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1351.0s)]
*  Was it all right? [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1352.0s)]
*  Lovely. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1353.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1360.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=104sNDhH7G0&t=1390.0s)]
