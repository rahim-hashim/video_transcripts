Video Description: President Trump has been invited to the UK for a second state visit by King Charles.  Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer used his trip to the White House to present Trump with the invitation letter from the King.

Sir Keir said the president's last state visit in 2019 had been a "tremendous success" and that the invite for a second visit was "truly historic" and "unprecedented".

Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office after reading the letter, Trump said he accepted the invite and that it would be an "honour" to visit the "fantastic" country.  He added that King Charles was a "beautiful man, a wonderful man".

Traditionally second-term US presidents are not offered a state visit and have instead been invited for tea or lunch with the monarch at Windsor Castle.

Sir Starmer presented the letter from the King to President Trump, during their first meeting since his return to the White House for a second term.   The leaders discussed Ukraine, with Sir Keir hoping to persuade the US to provide a military “backstop” to any European peacekeeping force deployed in the country.   They also talked about trade, with the British government hoping to avoid tariffs which Mr Trump is planning to impose on other countries.

**BBC - The Latest:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ)
*  Sakhir Starmer has been welcomed to the White House by Donald Trump, with both leaders hailing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=0.0s)]
*  their talks as a major success, saying they've made progress towards ending the war in Ukraine [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=5.28s)]
*  and on agreeing a trade deal between Britain and the US. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=10.88s)]
*  At a news conference, Mr Trump said he was particularly honoured for himself and his [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=14.52s)]
*  country to have been presented with a letter from the King, inviting him for a second state [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=18.48s)]
*  visit to the UK. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=23.0s)]
*  Well, our political editor Chris Mason joins us live now from Washington. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  You were there, Chris. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=28.92s)]
*  How did it go? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=29.92s)]
*  Rita, this was a meeting that mattered. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=30.92s)]
*  The Prime Minister, the guest of a fellow leader, the most unpredictable of his era. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=35.32s)]
*  Would Sakhir Starmer be able to establish a relationship, a rapport, where so many other [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=41.6s)]
*  world leaders appear to be failing? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  And on the substance, what about Ukraine and what about trade? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=51.68000000000001s)]
*  Here is what's been happening here this evening. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=57.4s)]
*  It is perhaps the ultimate political stage and backdrop and is now home to a president [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=63.4s)]
*  whose love and command of that stage is reshaping the world before our eyes. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=68.32s)]
*  The Prime Minister arrived here at the White House for one of the landmark moments of his [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=73.75999999999999s)]
*  time in office so far. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=78.16s)]
*  Running by news conference is rapidly becoming the norm here. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=82.4s)]
*  Today was no different. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=86.04s)]
*  And for a president who likes a theatrical flourish, the Prime Minister had one in his [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=87.80000000000001s)]
*  inside pocket. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=92.56s)]
*  So can I present a letter from the King to you? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=93.56s)]
*  Yes, thank you very much. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=96.76s)]
*  Am I supposed to read it right now? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=97.76s)]
*  Yes, please do. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=100.76s)]
*  Oh, that's well. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=103.76s)]
*  Well, that is really nice. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=106.76s)]
*  I must make sure his signature is on that. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  A beautiful man, a wonderful man. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=112.52s)]
*  Perhaps you'd like to say what that very important paragraph? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=116.08s)]
*  Yes, so this is a letter from His Majesty the King. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=118.75999999999999s)]
*  It's an invitation for a second state visit. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=123.08s)]
*  This is really special. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=128.0s)]
*  This has never happened before. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=129.28s)]
*  This is unprecedented. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=130.92s)]
*  And I think that just symbolizes the strength of the relationship between us. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=133.92s)]
*  So this is a very special letter. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=139.0s)]
*  I think the last state visit was a tremendous success. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=142.23999999999998s)]
*  It was. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=144.23999999999998s)]
*  His Majesty the King wants to make this even better than that. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=145.23999999999998s)]
*  So this is truly historic. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=148.56s)]
*  And that says it wins her. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=151.76s)]
*  That's really something. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=152.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=153.76s)]
*  What I haven't got yet is your answer. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=154.76s)]
*  The answer is yes. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=157.76s)]
*  So what do the socialist human rights lawyer and brash real estate tycoon actually have [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=163.79999999999998s)]
*  in common? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=168.72s)]
*  He loves his country and so do I. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=170.28s)]
*  That's our common theme. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=172.96s)]
*  He loves his country and I love our country. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=176.72s)]
*  We also have two countries that have gotten along for the longest period of time. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=178.76s)]
*  Number one ally on each side. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=184.84s)]
*  Ukraine is a key talking point here and there's a key question at the heart of it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=187.52s)]
*  Mr. President, could you be persuaded as part of a peace settlement in Ukraine to provide [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=192.68s)]
*  air cover a backstop security position to the contributions that Europe might make as [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=197.76000000000002s)]
*  well? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=202.08s)]
*  Well, so President Zelensky is coming to see me on Friday, Friday morning, and we're going [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=203.08s)]
*  to be signing really a very important agreement for both sides because it's really going to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=209.48000000000002s)]
*  get us into that country. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=213.52s)]
*  We'll be working there. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=215.64000000000001s)]
*  We'll have a lot of people work in there. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=216.64000000000001s)]
*  And so in that sense, it's very good. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=219.0s)]
*  It's a backstop, you could say. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=221.04000000000002s)]
*  I don't think anybody's going to play around if we're there with a lot of workers. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=222.20000000000002s)]
*  You know, we've already indicated that we'll play out full part in making sure that any [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=226.52s)]
*  deal if there is one, and I hope there is, and I think this is a historic moment to make [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=230.48000000000002s)]
*  sure it's a lasting deal and we're about to have a discussion about how we can make that [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=234.8s)]
*  work. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=238.96s)]
*  And what of the President's description of Ukraine's leader? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=239.96s)]
*  Mr. President, do you still think that Mr. Zelensky is a dictator? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=243.60000000000002s)]
*  Did I say that? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=250.04000000000002s)]
*  I can't believe I said that. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=251.04000000000002s)]
*  Next question. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=253.04000000000002s)]
*  Trade is on the agenda too. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=254.56s)]
*  There's plenty of countries that are slapped with tariffs, import taxes by America. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=258.59999999999997s)]
*  What of the UK? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=263.68s)]
*  I have a great warm spot for your country. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=264.68s)]
*  And our trade obviously is fair and balanced and in fact you've got a bit of a surplus, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=268.24s)]
*  so we're in a different position there. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=272.71999999999997s)]
*  So does that mean there won't be any sanctions on the UK? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=274.2s)]
*  Well I have to take a look. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=278.2s)]
*  I mean we're going to have a good discussion today and we have some very talented people [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=279.2s)]
*  on the other side. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=283.8s)]
*  Next we were kicked out. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=285.48s)]
*  They went into their private discussions and emerged a few hours later for a news conference [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=286.92s)]
*  where the President said the Prime Minister was a tough negotiator, the war in Ukraine [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=292.08s)]
*  will end fairly soon or not at all, and he was asked had Kyrstama persuaded him not to [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=296.40000000000003s)]
*  put tariffs on the UK? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=302.72s)]
*  He tried. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=305.28000000000003s)]
*  He was working hard, I'll tell you that. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=308.72s)]
*  He yearned whatever the hell they pay him over there. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=311.68s)]
*  But he tried. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=315.15999999999997s)]
*  I think there's a very good chance that in the case of these two great friendly countries [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=317.24s)]
*  I think we could very well end up with a real trade deal where the tariffs wouldn't be necessary. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=321.86s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=330.15999999999997s)]
*  But he yearned whatever they pay him here and today. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=331.15999999999997s)]
*  He was working hard at lunch and I'm very receptive to it. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=335.12s)]
*  But I think we, in all fairness, in all seriousness, I think we have a very good chance at arriving [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=339.04s)]
*  at a very good deal. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=344.0s)]
*  The US-UK relationship has always been close but there are no guarantees with the new resident [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=346.36s)]
*  here. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=352.32000000000005s)]
*  But for now at least the Prime Minister's escaped the barbs and frost others have encountered. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=353.48s)]
*  Well in a moment we'll talk to our economics editor Faisal Islam who's here with me and [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=362.64000000000004s)]
*  to our North America editor Sarah Smith. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=367.12s)]
*  But Chris first to you, what else was discussed? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=369.35999999999996s)]
*  This was an extraordinary couple of hours Rita. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=375.32s)]
*  I've never quite seen the Prime Minister being as tactile as he was in public with a fellow [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=377.64s)]
*  leader, perhaps picking up on a bit of the tactics of the French President the other [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=383.88s)]
*  day and recognising that there's a President here who delights in the public stage, delights [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=388.12s)]
*  in nonchalantly running away from remarks that he's made and caused outrage by just [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=394.68s)]
*  a matter of days or weeks earlier, hence my question to him about his remarks about President [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=399.8s)]
*  Zelensky. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=405.76s)]
*  And then also in President Trump, a man who is a sort of one man news machine, so throws [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=406.76s)]
*  out views on all sorts of things the whole time. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=412.16s)]
*  So a couple of other things for instance, the row that we brought you about, the Chagos [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=414.96000000000004s)]
*  islands, that archipelago in the Indian Ocean, the UK's plan to hand it over to Mauritius, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=419.92s)]
*  real concern from some at home and abroad about that. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=425.24s)]
*  Perhaps surprisingly the President saying in the exchanges tonight that he thinks the [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=428.88s)]
*  deal in which the military base there would be rented back is probably a good one. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=432.72s)]
*  There's been a thought that it might be vetoed by the Trump administration, it sounded like [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=438.32s)]
*  it was endorsed by the President. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=442.5s)]
*  The Prime Minister will leave Washington tonight relieved because they acknowledged his team [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=445.64s)]
*  that yes they'd prepared hard for today but they didn't have the faintest idea how it [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=449.84s)]
*  might go. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=454.4s)]
*  That they do seem to have an established and unlikely warmth and connection between them, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=455.4s)]
*  the two men. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=461.03999999999996s)]
*  There weren't any flash points or moments that were excruciating, which are always possible [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=462.03999999999996s)]
*  when you're there with President Trump. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=467.59999999999997s)]
*  And there will be that big state visit to come as well. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=470.36s)]
*  On Ukraine though, we see still the potential for division. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=474.86s)]
*  The President saying that he thinks that there is something amounting to a backstop because [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=479.46s)]
*  there'll be American presence in Ukraine as part of this minerals deal that will be signed [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=484.14s)]
*  here tomorrow when President Zelensky is in Washington. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=488.02s)]
*  But it doesn't look certain yet that Britain and Europe are necessarily convinced that [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=491.7s)]
*  that will amount to enough for the peacekeepers that the UK and others are likely to offer [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=496.94s)]
*  if there is a deal. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=503.06s)]
*  Quite a night here. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=505.1s)]
*  Indeed, many thanks. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=506.70000000000005s)]
*  Chris Mason there in Washington. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=507.90000000000003s)]
*  Well Faisal, who's with me? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=510.14000000000004s)]
*  Faisal, President Trump we heard him there saying that there was a good chance of a trade [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=511.54s)]
*  deal with the UK and quickly. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=516.34s)]
*  Does that mean we can rest easy? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=518.22s)]
*  Well I think number 10 and number 11 will be delighted about these words about a very [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=519.38s)]
*  good trade deal avoiding tariffs. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=524.14s)]
*  I think I was struck by the use by the Prime Minister of the term economic deal, other [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=526.66s)]
*  cabinet ministers are using that tonight. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=531.34s)]
*  So it's not quite the same thing that we were discussing after Brexit under Boris Johnson [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=532.98s)]
*  under Theresa May which would be a general free trade agreement. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=536.7800000000001s)]
*  It's about avoiding extra tariffs that look like they are going to be levied on Canada, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=539.9s)]
*  on Mexico, on China and on the European Union. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=544.5s)]
*  That is a good thing but it's a different thing to some of what we've been discussing. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=546.62s)]
*  I'm also struck by the presence and the focus on the Vice President JD Vance in negotiating [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=550.1s)]
*  this. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=556.14s)]
*  This will mean that there are some opportunities in the tech industries but there may be some, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=557.14s)]
*  there will be some quid pro quo here. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=560.66s)]
*  Perhaps on the UK digital services tax that raises a billion pounds a year. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=562.22s)]
*  Perhaps on the online harms bill which he raised in the Oval Office I think as being [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=565.82s)]
*  problematic for US tech companies. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=569.3s)]
*  Are we willing to give some of those things up? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=570.98s)]
*  And there's the bigger issue, even if we avoid direct tariffs and it's still an if, what [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=572.86s)]
*  about a globalised tariff war that's still going to affect an open economy like the UK? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=576.54s)]
*  And Faisal you're presenting Newsnight tonight, you're a busy person, what have you got on? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=581.46s)]
*  We'll be digging into this with a former US ambassador to Europe, with a former Trump [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=585.9s)]
*  official and the satirist Armando Iannucci over on BBC Two at 10.30 and on iPlayer, BBC [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=590.74s)]
*  Newsnight. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=596.86s)]
*  We'll see you later, thank you very much. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=597.86s)]
*  Faisal Islam there. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=598.86s)]
*  And to Sarah Smith now who's in Washington for us. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=599.86s)]
*  Sarah, tomorrow it is President Zelensky's turn to visit the White House. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=603.5s)]
*  How likely is that deal over Ukraine's minerals? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=607.5s)]
*  President Trump seems convinced that he, President Zelensky is coming here in order to sign that, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=614.02s)]
*  that that has already been agreed. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=619.4200000000001s)]
*  And for Ukraine that is very much the price of admission I think, to be able to join the [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=622.4200000000001s)]
*  talks as to what a ceasefire or a peace deal in Ukraine might look like. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=626.22s)]
*  We know that President Zelensky had at first tried to insist that there would be security [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=630.58s)]
*  guarantees for Ukraine to back up any kind of ceasefire or peace deal contained in that [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=635.02s)]
*  minerals agreement and that is not going to happen. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=641.74s)]
*  You heard President Trump earlier saying the simple fact that there was a deal that there [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=644.1400000000001s)]
*  would be American companies working in and investing in Ukraine should be a security [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=647.6600000000001s)]
*  backstop in itself. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=652.3000000000001s)]
*  Now, Ukraine will not agree with that and clearly Keir Starmer and the UK don't agree [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=653.7800000000001s)]
*  with that either but that will be a matter for further talks. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=657.94s)]
*  President Trump was being remarkably complimentary though about President Zelensky today, much [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=661.26s)]
*  more so than usual saying that he likes him a great deal, he respects him, talking about [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=666.22s)]
*  how bravely he and his country have fought against the Russians and how Donald Trump [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=671.3000000000001s)]
*  respects that and as you heard earlier he seems to have forgotten ever having called [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=675.4200000000001s)]
*  him a dictator which he posted on social media. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=679.6600000000001s)]
*  The talks tomorrow will focus on looking ahead beyond this minerals agreement to what a ceasefire [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=683.14s)]
*  or a peace deal could look like. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=688.3000000000001s)]
*  On that Ukraine and the US do remain fairly far apart but this is President Zelensky's [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=690.62s)]
*  opportunity for the first time face to face to talk to Donald Trump about it. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=694.86s)]
*  Sarah Smith, thank you very much. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPoXlXwrgQ&t=699.9s)]
