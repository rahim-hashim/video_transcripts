**BBC - The Latest:** [May 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE)
*  Now we're going to focus on events in Israel and Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=0.0s)]
*  Dozens of people are reported to have been killed in the latest wave of Israeli strikes across Gaza [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=3.44s)]
*  with the Hamas-run civil defense agency putting the number of deaths at 94. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=8.4s)]
*  Eye witnesses say there have been airstrikes and shelling from artillery and tanks with some of [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=14.0s)]
*  the heaviest bombardments in and around the Jabalio refugee camp in the north of Gaza. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=19.12s)]
*  Israel says its operations target what it describes as Hamas terrorists [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=24.16s)]
*  and says it has issued evacuation orders to civilians ahead of the attacks. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=28.319999999999997s)]
*  Well for the next half an hour we'll be looking at the situation in detail but what do we know [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=33.04s)]
*  about some of these latest Israeli strikes on Gaza? Here's BBC Verifier's Mellon Thomas. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=37.44s)]
*  Over a 24-hour period Israel intensified its strikes in Gaza, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=44.08s)]
*  hitting two hospitals as well as Jabalia in the north. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=48.08s)]
*  Israel says it was conducting strikes against Hamas fighters and infrastructure. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=52.0s)]
*  We verified the strikes of the two hospitals here, the European hospital and the Nasser hospital. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=56.72s)]
*  They're both in southern Gaza. Let's start with the European hospital which was hit Tuesday evening [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=62.72s)]
*  local time. Multiple bombs were dropped simultaneously leaving large plumes of smoke [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=68.08s)]
*  rising from the hospital site. The attack killed and injured dozens of people according to the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=73.84s)]
*  Hamas-run civil defense agency and you can see just how deep the impact of those bombs are [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=78.56s)]
*  in this video. And here's the aftermath which shows a damaged bus hanging inside a crater. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=84.72s)]
*  This video was filmed in the hospital's courtyard. In total we've counted and verified seven craters [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=92.08s)]
*  around the hospital building which we've mapped out here. Munitions expert Trevor Ball told BBC [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=99.12s)]
*  Verify that so-called bunker buster bombs were likely used in this strike. These are a type of [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=105.2s)]
*  weapon designed to penetrate underground targets like a tunnel system. Israel has previously used [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=110.64s)]
*  them to kill senior Hezbollah figures including former leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut last year. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=115.92s)]
*  Now Israeli media reported that the target of the European hospital strike was senior Hamas figure [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=121.36s)]
*  Mohammad Sinwar, the younger brother of the former Hamas leader in Gaza Yahya Sinwar who was killed [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=126.72s)]
*  by the IDF in October but the IDF haven't yet commented. Now Israel says it targeted an [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  underground terrorist infrastructure at the hospital site but they didn't provide any evidence [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=138.24s)]
*  of this. They did release this video which they claimed was of the European hospital but that's [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=142.72s)]
*  incorrect. It's actually a school a few hundred meters away and we've reached out to the Israeli [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=147.84s)]
*  army for comments about this but we've not yet heard back. Now in the early hours of Tuesday morning [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=153.68s)]
*  the Israeli army also struck another hospital, the Nasser hospital, with a different munition. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=159.36s)]
*  We verified this footage of smoke billowing from the fourth floor window of the hospital [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=164.72s)]
*  after the strike. Images like this shared online also show substantial damage inside the hospital [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=168.72s)]
*  building. Hassan Aslih, a journalist who has reported extensively from Gaza for many years, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  was at the hospital receiving treatment at the time of the attack. A verified video of the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  aftermath confirmed he was killed at the scene. Now Israel has accused Aslih of direct involvement [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=185.36s)]
*  in the seventh October attacks. He reported on the assault and shared photos of himself at the scene. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=190.64s)]
*  Israel strikes have killed around 100 people over a 24-hour period in these two hospital strikes [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=197.83999999999997s)]
*  as well as in Gebelia, footage of which you can see here. This comes at a moment when the UN's [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=203.92s)]
*  head of humanitarian affairs has called on world leaders to prevent, in his words, genocide. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=209.76s)]
*  Merlin Thomas there from BBC Verify. Well joining me now are Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=215.68s)]
*  Yuland Nel, who's in Jerusalem, and Rushdie Abu Alouf, our Gaza correspondent. Rushdie, just [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=222.24s)]
*  first of all on the toll on human life and injuries that we are seeing, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=229.12s)]
*  do we know, are there any numbers from any side as to how many of those people are Hamas [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=234.96s)]
*  supporters or members and how many are civilians? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=241.52s)]
*  Well the hospitals usually do not issue this kind of details about who's like targets and who's killed. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=248.24s)]
*  As far as we know, about 103 people were killed just since midnight. In the latest airstrike [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=256.08s)]
*  in the north killed about 13 people, six of them are children. The place described by one of the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=267.12s)]
*  local journalists in the north as like a building, housing, a prayer hall and a charity clinic in the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=276.08s)]
*  place. But if you look at the number of civilian casualties among 100 people, only in Nasr hospital [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=283.92s)]
*  issue a statement saying that 50 percent of those killed in the last 36 hours were women and children. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=292.8s)]
*  Of course Israel said that they are targeting Hamas and in fact yes they did in many strikes [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=303.12s)]
*  they have targeted Hamas but the number of civilian casualties are raising in a very sharp way since the [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=310.16s)]
*  attack on the European hospital yesterday. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=318.0s)]
*  Yolan Nel in Jerusalem, we've heard multiple reports of Israel building up its military [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=323.2s)]
*  operation, what is known so far on that? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=331.28000000000003s)]
*  So basically the Israeli security cabinet has approved this plan for an intense military [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=334.88s)]
*  offensive in the Gaza Strip that would forcibly displace the population to the southern part and [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=341.44s)]
*  would see a takeover of aid distribution by a newly created foundation we believe working with [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=349.6s)]
*  private security companies with the Israeli military in the periphery providing further [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=358.72s)]
*  security. That has proved to be extremely controversial. We have the UN and other [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=366.32000000000005s)]
*  humanitarian partners who have been working in Gaza rejecting any cooperation with that suggesting [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=371.04s)]
*  it would be a weaponization of aid. And that threat to carry out that wider offensive is really still [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=377.44s)]
*  hanging there as President Trump is visiting the region with Israeli sources indicating that they [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=387.04s)]
*  are ready to begin that offensive once he leaves. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=392.96s)]
*  And Paul Adams, we've seen that Donald Trump hasn't visited Israel on this trip, has there been any [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=397.52s)]
*  negotiation possibility whilst Trump is in the region and is there any possibility of Israel [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=405.44s)]
*  not going ahead with that military operation? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=412.96s)]
*  Well certainly there have been negotiations going on. There indeed has been a meeting in Doha, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=417.03999999999996s)]
*  in Qatar involving Steve Witkoff, Donald Trump's envoy, an Israeli delegation and Qatari mediators. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=423.03999999999996s)]
*  The details of those negotiations are not clear. This seems to be once again an attempt to get [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=433.2s)]
*  some kind of formula that would see a return to the phased end to the conflict with Hamas releasing [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=438.8s)]
*  a number of hostages in return for Israel's military withdrawal, gradual withdrawal from [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=446.96000000000004s)]
*  the Gaza Strip. Now we've seen these formulas discussed over and over and over again in recent [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=453.36s)]
*  months. It was a kind of impatience on the part of the Israeli government that saw the end [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=458.8s)]
*  of the first ceasefire back at the beginning of March. And so I don't think hopes are particularly [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=464.48s)]
*  high that Mr Witkoff is going to pull off another deal that would see a suspension of Israel's [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=470.96s)]
*  military operation. At the moment, Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's Prime Minister, seems absolutely [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=479.03999999999996s)]
*  hell-bent on launching this major, major intervention which some dire predictions have suggested could [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=484.4s)]
*  see the almost complete evacuation of the northern part of the Gaza Strip and the destruction of [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=493.28s)]
*  pretty much the remaining civilian infrastructure there, with civilians huddled in the south and [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=498.32s)]
*  getting aid from the new set up that Duolam was just describing, if indeed that Gaza Humanitarian [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=505.28s)]
*  Foundation scheme ever gets off the ground. So yes, there is a negotiation going on. We have not [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=512.8s)]
*  seen Donald Trump personally getting involved in it. His hosts around the Gulf will have been [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=519.76s)]
*  urging him to use whatever pressure he can to bring this about. But time is running out to prevent [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=527.92s)]
*  this major military escalation. And you'll un-nell, just to try to understand Netanyahu's motivation [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=534.3199999999999s)]
*  here, it was very striking during the last US administration, Anthony Blinken, as he was parting, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=541.12s)]
*  he made a number of speeches and he said that despite the numbers of Hamas fighters who had [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=546.56s)]
*  been killed, by American accounts there was still almost the same number coming through to replace [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=552.8s)]
*  those people. Is the argument within Israel still, and does it have popular support, that Hamas can [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=559.28s)]
*  effectively be totally wiped out, or is there much more complex politics at play about Netanyahu's [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=566.4s)]
*  survival? I mean, definitely there are complex politics going on here. It remains Israel's stated [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=573.76s)]
*  war goal that it wants to dismantle Hamas in terms of its governing capabilities and in terms of its [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=581.84s)]
*  fighting capabilities in the Gaza Strip to completely remove the threat from Hamas. But you [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=588.3199999999999s)]
*  have seen, particularly when it comes to the hostages, this issue in the Israeli public, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=595.84s)]
*  a shift. It's thought that at least 23 Israeli hostages are still alive, up to 23, in the Gaza Strip, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=603.04s)]
*  being held by Hamas. And opinion polls suggest that about two-thirds of the Israeli public would be [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=611.52s)]
*  prepared to have concessions, to see an end to the war and to prioritise bringing back those hostages [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=617.92s)]
*  that are still alive. That is really sort of a big point, a big division in Israel at the moment, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=626.72s)]
*  because on the other hand you have the Israeli government that is really wedded to this idea of [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=635.28s)]
*  an expanding military offensive. Of course you have the hardliners in the government who also talk [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=640.1600000000001s)]
*  ultimately enthusiastically about Israel taking over the Gaza Strip to have an indefinite military [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=645.44s)]
*  occupation there and ultimately they want to see the re-establishment of Jewish settlements. And [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=654.5600000000001s)]
*  they talk very enthusiastically about President Trump's plan of really persuading the population [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=659.6800000000001s)]
*  of Gaza, more than two million people, to leave the Strip. And there have been suggestions again [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=666.96s)]
*  in the Israeli parliament in recent days that that is something that Israel is really actively [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=673.12s)]
*  pursuing, is looking for other countries that would take in Gazans. They're portraying this as [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=678.16s)]
*  being a voluntary emigration programme, but humanitarian officials say this would be anything [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=683.76s)]
*  but because the conditions that are being created in Gaza at the moment are really making it [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=690.3199999999999s)]
*  unlivable. And Rushdie Abouluf, our Gaza correspondent, is it possible to assess [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=695.52s)]
*  really how people are feeling? We've seen obviously desperate images of people, many reports of people [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=701.76s)]
*  struggling for food and their basics. But is there any sign of people wanting to leave, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=707.92s)]
*  to escape this current crisis? And is Hamas still being supported by large parts of the population [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=715.12s)]
*  there? Well it is very frustrating events in Gaza, especially after a very little window of hope [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=722.0s)]
*  when Trump visited the area. The departure of Trump from Qatar today without any achievement [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=733.76s)]
*  when it comes to the ceasefire was very frustrating. But also when I was talking to people [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=742.64s)]
*  like almost every day about the idea of evacuating Gaza to the north, to the south, if Israel started [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=748.32s)]
*  the operation, many, many of them said that we are not going to repeat what they call the mistake [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=755.28s)]
*  they have done back in October 2023 when they left Gaza and the north to the south. One of them [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=761.76s)]
*  is like 74 years old man, he said I was one of the first few people to leave with 60 members of my [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=770.72s)]
*  family, but he said killing is everywhere. He said members of my family were killed in a place called [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=777.6s)]
*  the safe zone in Almawasi that we were ordered by the Israelis to go there. So people are not really [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=783.84s)]
*  open with the daily evacuation orders. For example, yesterday Israel published a map for like five, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=789.68s)]
*  six places and when I talked to the people, they ordered them to evacuate. When I talked to the [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=798.3199999999999s)]
*  people this morning, very few people left these areas and people know the risk and people know [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=804.7199999999999s)]
*  that they might be killed. But they said the killing is everywhere. Today for example, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=810.64s)]
*  56 people were killed in Chaniunis. It's the place where Israel would ideally ask people to leave [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=816.4s)]
*  there. So there is no safe zone. That's the war that the Palestinians keep repeating, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=823.12s)]
*  not only this time but since the beginning of the war. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=830.0s)]
*  But what about actually leaving Gaza itself? Is that something that more people will want to do [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=832.96s)]
*  given the desperate conditions they're facing? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=838.8000000000001s)]
*  Well, yes, most people want to leave Gaza. I mean, the people posting social media expressing their [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=841.04s)]
*  willingness to go somewhere safe. We have seen a hundred thousand people already left Gaza since [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=846.7199999999999s)]
*  the war. Most of them are here in Egypt and some of them want to return back. I mean, the issue for [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=855.4399999999999s)]
*  the Palestinians is they want to leave, but they want to have the right to return. They want to [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=861.52s)]
*  leave, but they want to have the right to return. They believe this time if they leave Gaza, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=868.4s)]
*  they won't be able to go back. With others, many others, they believe that they will stand in their [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=873.36s)]
*  lands whether it's airstrike or evacuation order or whatever. So the people are divided about [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=880.16s)]
*  this issue. But yes, in fact, when we talk to people, when we follow people on social media, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=888.0s)]
*  many people wanted to leave Gaza. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=893.68s)]
*  Rushdie, Yolande and Paul, do stay with us. We are going to focus further on Gaza, but I just [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=895.92s)]
*  want to bring in another report because Israel doesn't allow independent access to the enclave [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=901.6800000000001s)]

*  Fergal Keane sent this report, a warning his report does contain upsetting images. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=921.36s)]
*  In the late evening light, a journey into the skies. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=929.36s)]
*  For those who've known, only the shrinking ground of Gaza for the last 19 months. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=935.76s)]
*  What's it like in Gaza? Horrible. No words can describe how much horrible it is, like on all [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=940.8s)]
*  levels. This is a happy moment for these children and their parents. They've traveled all day. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=944.9599999999999s)]
*  They've come from a place of hunger and death. Now this helicopter is going to take them to Amman [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=952.9599999999999s)]

*  possible cancer treatment. Safa Salah with her son Youssef heading for treatment. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=970.96s)]
*  She wanted me to read a message. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=982.24s)]
*  It is hard to imagine what these sights mean to eyes that have looked only on desolation. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=983.76s)]
*  In the place they left, this. Carnage left by a different aircraft. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=998.96s)]
*  A hospital bombed by Israel. The CCTV camera capturing the moment of impact and aftermath. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1005.76s)]
*  Absolutely massive strike on EGH hospital. This is right in front of the emergency room. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1014.4s)]
*  The Israelis alleged the leader of Hamas was hiding in a bunker under the hospital. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1024.16s)]
*  28 people were killed, dozens wounded. So standing outside the operating theatre, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1029.52s)]
*  you can see the damage behind me. It's not even possible to take any faces to theatre because it's [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1034.8s)]
*  too dangerous. In Amman, the families who've escaped for now. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1040.64s)]
*  The horror of what's happening in Gaza. It is new and strange here, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1048.88s)]
*  but they will meet other Gazan evacuees who've already come. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1054.16s)]
*  Like Habiba Alaskari, who was brought to Jordan in January with gangrene in two of her arms and a leg. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1061.6000000000001s)]

*  a triple amputee. Doctors could not save her limbs, but she's a determined child and adapting. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1079.3600000000001s)]
*  Her mum Rana wants her someday to go home. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1090.16s)]
*  To me, Gaza will always be beautiful, the most beautiful place on this earth, says Rana. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1092.8799999999999s)]
*  But home to war or peace, nobody knows. Fergal Keen, BBC News, Amman. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1101.6s)]
*  Well, the BBC website has a live page on the situation in Gaza running today with our team [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1110.24s)]
*  of correspondents in the region, including just one float. I just want to bring you to one [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1115.6s)]
*  excerpt there from our correspondent, Alice Cuddy, who spoke to or was in touch with one family [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1122.24s)]
*  there in Gaza, a nurse and a mother of two, Roar Mohsen. Alice was asking her about how she's [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1129.36s)]
*  coping on a daily basis, feeding two young daughters aged three and 18 months in the war zone [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1137.52s)]
*  and under blockade talking about how much food they have and how she's coping. It's worth a read [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1142.9599999999998s)]
*  as one part of the live page. And I just want to bring in our correspondents more on this question [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1149.52s)]
*  now. Paul Adams, our diplomatic correspondent, Yolande in Jerusalem, and Rushdie Abu Alouf, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1154.16s)]
*  our Gaza correspondent. Rushdie, if I can start with you, from what you know, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1160.08s)]
*  how much food do people have at the moment? [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1164.16s)]
*  Well, very little. You know, during the two months of ceasefire, Israel used to allow [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1170.96s)]
*  around 400 to 500 trucks every day loaded with food, medicine and fuel. But now for [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1176.1599999999999s)]
*  70 days or over 70 days, nothing has been allowed in. So there is a severe shortage of fuel, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1184.3999999999999s)]
*  severe shortage of water. 25 percent of the samples taken from water that people are drinking every [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1191.28s)]
*  day are contaminated and undrinkable, according to some expert and local authorities in Gaza. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1201.12s)]
*  There is very few places where still people can locally, you know, grow some fruit and vegetables, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1209.52s)]
*  but the prices are like 10, 15 times higher than the usual price. And most important [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1218.1599999999999s)]
*  is that the flour is running out of Gaza. So in some areas, people are grinding, you know, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1225.28s)]
*  pasta, grinding any sort of, you know, dry food and make it to produce bread. Most of the community [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1231.84s)]
*  kitchen, which used to serve free food for the people, they are running out of gas, they are [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1241.92s)]
*  running out of cooking oil, they are running out of any essential to cook the food. So Gaza is [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1248.24s)]
*  really at the edge of famine. I mean, talking to people every day, people are starving. When [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1254.96s)]
*  I talk to friends and family members and colleagues, even journalists, local journalists [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1260.88s)]
*  in Gaza, they struggle to find food for their children. Even if you have money, and if you [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1267.68s)]
*  have a lot of money in Gaza now, it doesn't matter because you can't find what you need to feed your [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1275.52s)]
*  family. I've been talking to people throughout the war in the last like two years. This is the first [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1282.64s)]
*  time where I feel that the people are really at the edge of famine. Yulan, now Israel and the US [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1289.68s)]
*  have a different solution to getting aid in. Is there worry in the Israeli population about what [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1298.16s)]
*  might be coming if such a big population within Gaza is on the edge of famine? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1305.92s)]
*  To be honest, there isn't a huge amount of discussion on it in the Israeli media. The [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1312.72s)]
*  Israeli government has said that the reason it closed all crossings back on the 2nd of March [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1318.0s)]
*  was to put pressure on Hamas to give up the remaining hostages it's holding. In general, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1322.8799999999999s)]
*  it accuses Hamas of stealing aid, of diverting supplies for its own purposes. Hamas has denied [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1328.48s)]
*  the UN and other agencies have been saying that they have strong supervision of the aid that came [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1337.12s)]
*  into Gaza and how they distribute it. But the suggestion has been, which is backed by the US, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1342.3999999999999s)]
*  that there could be this newly created Gaza humanitarian foundation, as it's called, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1349.12s)]
*  that could take over aid distribution. This would be concentrated according to a document that it's [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1354.72s)]
*  put out, it seems, for potential donors at four or five distribution points in the south of the [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1360.56s)]
*  Gaza Strip with part of the stated aim of the Israeli government to really use the fact that [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1368.72s)]
*  aid would only be distributed there as an incentive for people to move to the south or as bait, as one [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1375.52s)]
*  UN official put it. Now, that has proved, as I was indicating earlier, extremely controversial and [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1381.9199999999998s)]
*  the UN and others have said that it does not meet their humanitarian principles of independence [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1388.56s)]
*  and impartiality, that they will not go along with this. Interestingly, there was a letter that was [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1395.12s)]
*  written by the Gaza humanitarian foundation in which it suggested, this is in the past day, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1401.04s)]
*  that there should be the UN and others allowed to pick up humanitarian operations for the time [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1407.44s)]
*  being, but saying that this new foundation could be ready to start work by the end of this month. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1413.92s)]
*  It's not clear yet if Israel will pick up the idea of some kind of at least a bridging [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1420.48s)]
*  arrangement to let food in, because we've had the UN really pointing out this week that this is a [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1425.76s)]
*  really terrible man-made starvation crisis that is happening in real time before our eyes and at the [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1433.44s)]
*  same time you have something like 116,000 metric tons of food aid really lined up outside the [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1442.08s)]
*  crossings that could go into Gaza if Israel was to open them. Paul Adams, briefly, how pivotal a [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1449.12s)]
*  moment is this for the people of Gaza worried about their basic food access and security and [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1454.1599999999999s)]
*  the people of Israel still worried about their security? I think this is a very key moment. Look, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1460.3999999999999s)]
*  as Rushdie just said, we've heard the warnings about starvation and hunger before throughout [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1466.08s)]
*  this crisis. I think probably more than ever we are on the edge of something very, very serious [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1472.4s)]
*  in the Gaza Strip. All the aid agencies are saying that and that's why the issue of this [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1478.64s)]
*  alternative mechanism is becoming more and more urgent, because if this situation is not resolved [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1484.24s)]
*  in the coming weeks, then we are going to see something that we have not seen [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1490.24s)]
*  so far throughout more than a year and a half of this crisis. Paul Adams, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1494.88s)]
*  Yuland Nel and Rushdie Abou-Aloof, thank you all very much indeed for helping us all to focus [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI7u65IvejE&t=1499.68s)]
