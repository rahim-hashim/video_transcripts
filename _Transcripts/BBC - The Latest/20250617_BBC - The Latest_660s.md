**BBC - The Latest:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4)
*  We start this hour in the Middle East where Israel and Iran have attacked each other for a fifth consecutive day. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=0.0s)]
*  Reports of damage and casualties in both countries. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=6.8s)]
*  Let's take a look at Israel where on Tuesday morning this video was recorded in Tel Aviv, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=9.84s)]
*  apparently as an Iranian airstrike was taking place. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=14.24s)]
*  And this footage was filmed shortly afterwards in the city. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=17.28s)]
*  Plumes of smoke rising there, not yet clear what damage or casualties there may have been here. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  Also reports of explosions in Jerusalem this morning. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  Meanwhile Israel's emergency services say five people have been injured by shrapnel [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=40.96s)]
*  at one of the impact sites in the central part of the country. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=45.6s)]
*  Iran says it's destroyed strategic targets in Israel using drones. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=48.96s)]
*  Well turning to Iran now there have been reports of Israeli airstrikes across the country. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=53.84s)]
*  They come after the Israeli military issued more evacuation orders for parts of Tehran. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=58.08s)]
*  Shortly after a similar Israeli warning was put in place on Monday the studios [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  of an Iranian state broadcaster were hit. The moment was broadcast live. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=66.8s)]
*  Well after that the station resumed broadcasting what appeared to be a taped program. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=80.48s)]
*  Shortly after that the network says three members of its staff are reported to have been killed. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  The Israeli military says it's continuing to kill senior Iranian officials including Ali Shadmani, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  wartime chief of staff who was hit in an airstrike in central Tehran. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=97.2s)]
*  It says he was the closest military advisor to the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=101.52s)]
*  The Israeli military also released this footage but it says it shows it destroying two Iranian [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=107.52s)]
*  fighter jets at Tehran airport as well as trucks delivering weapons. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=112.64s)]
*  Meanwhile President Trump has left the G7 summit in Canada early because of the continuing crisis [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  in the Middle East. That's the White House press secretary Caroline Levitt saying [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=125.52s)]
*  making that announcement Monday evening saying President Trump is returning to Washington so [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=130.4s)]
*  he can attend to many important matters. Speak to our Middle East correspondent Hugo Bacheca [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=134.48s)]
*  who's in Jerusalem for us. So more strikes Hugo just talk us through what's been happening. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=140.0s)]
*  Yeah Luis good morning. So we had a wave of Iranian missiles this morning with air raid [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=148.24s)]
*  alerts again sounding in many parts of Israel and again here in Jerusalem we had loud explosions of [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=154.48s)]
*  you know interceptions by the air defense systems and five people at least five people have been [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=160.64s)]
*  injured in central parts of Israel. We can't name the locations because of restrictions being posed [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=167.6s)]
*  by the Israeli authorities but again another wave of Iranian missiles as Iran responds to these [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=174.32s)]
*  Israeli airstrikes and in Iran there have been more attacks and you know in the last hour we [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=181.2s)]
*  had this confirmation by the Israeli military saying that they had killed Ali Shadimani who [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=187.27999999999997s)]
*  had been appointed to this position as a top military commander following the killing of his [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=192.88s)]
*  predecessor in a wave of in an Israeli strike last week. So this shows the level of penetration the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=198.72s)]
*  intelligence that the Israeli authorities have about these senior Iranian officials. Now again [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=205.2s)]
*  it's very difficult to get a clear picture of what's happening inside Iran because we can't report [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=213.2s)]
*  from inside the country but the indications from the Israeli authorities are that this campaign [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=217.83999999999997s)]
*  is going to continue for days not for weeks not days and last night the Israeli Prime Minister [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu gave an interview to an Iranian television channel based in London. He said [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=230.4s)]
*  Israel had significantly damaged Iran's nuclear and ballistic missiles programs but that [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=237.44s)]
*  its forces you know Israel's forces needed more time in this campaign so yet another indication [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=244.4s)]
*  that this campaign is likely to continue. And on that theme Hugo given we have a rough idea that [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=252.16s)]
*  there is a effectively a list of targets that Israel is is pursuing nuclear sites military [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=259.68s)]
*  commanders do we have any more detail and sense on what is on that list and when therefore it [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=266.16s)]
*  would be considered any kind of completion or mission accomplished from the Israeli point of view? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=272.88s)]
*  Yeah so what the Israeli authorities are saying is that they want to remove the threat posed by [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=281.36s)]
*  Iran's nuclear program and also by Iran's missile so we've seen that in the last few days since the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=287.04s)]
*  you know the Israeli military started this operation on Friday a number of different [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=293.36s)]
*  locations have been hit across Iran including nuclear facilities at Natanz also Isfahan but [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=297.84000000000003s)]
*  crucially they haven't been able to hit the underground facility at Fordow because the [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=306.32000000000005s)]
*  Israelis don't have the ability to strike this facility buried deep underground inside mountains [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=312.0s)]
*  so the Americans have the weapons the bombs needed you know to strike this facility so I think that's [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=318.72s)]
*  one of the reasons why you know the focus is now on President Trump and on whether he's going to [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=324.72s)]
*  you know announce American involvement direct American involvement in these strikes being [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=331.2s)]
*  carried out by Israel but again critics of the Prime Minister say that this is a war of choice [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=337.2s)]
*  and that diplomacy is going to be the only way to try to limit Iran's nuclear ambitions Iran's [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=342.24s)]
*  nuclear program and try to find a solution to this crisis. Hugo thank you as always. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=348.88s)]
*  I'm going to speak now to Sir Richard Dalton our former UK ambassador to Iran thank you for coming [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=355.84s)]
*  on the program. Thank you. We're in day five now consecutive strikes by each country where do you [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=360.8s)]
*  think things stand right now? More war and potentially wider war potential American [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=367.91999999999996s)]
*  involvement they might take the risk of retaliation against their facilities in the Middle East [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=376.8s)]
*  they might consider that they could bomb Fordow without that risk of retaliation because [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=384.0s)]
*  they have in turn threatened Iran with massive force if Iran should do that. The G7 communique [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=390.32s)]
*  was ineffectual de-escalation is pretty meaningless it just means you know carry on [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=399.84s)]
*  fighting but don't do it so hard they should have been calling for a ceasefire but there was no [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=407.92s)]
*  possibility of getting the United States to agree to that. So why do you say that why would the US [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=414.40000000000003s)]
*  not want to have that as the communique? Because they don't think that Israel should be forced to [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=422.8s)]
*  do anything that Israel hasn't voluntarily chosen to do and Israel has made clear that they've got [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=431.20000000000005s)]
*  weeks rather than days ahead of them before they have done the job they set out to do. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=438.88s)]
*  And why would the US get involved is it a case that they have certain military capabilities as [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=446.0s)]
*  Hugo was leaning towards there that simply Israel doesn't have on its own? Exactly I think Hugo was [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=451.59999999999997s)]
*  right on that point. The Americans who are addicted to violence in the Middle East but who have a very [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=459.03999999999996s)]
*  poor record of seeing it through with political outcomes to make the world a better place as a [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=467.92s)]
*  result may consider that Iran hasn't been sufficiently smashed up by the Israelis. Well you say that the [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=472.72s)]
*  US is addicted to violence there Donald Trump's pre-election message was not getting involved [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=480.48s)]
*  in more wars. It is but since when has Donald Trump been consistent since when has he put forward [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=488.48s)]
*  in connection with the Middle East a set of coherent messages? Okay let's move on to the [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=496.71999999999997s)]
*  diplomacy side of it clearly your area of expertise when these strikes stop however they do if there [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=502.47999999999996s)]
*  is an escalation first with US involvement or not what kind of resolution would you be looking at here? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=509.91999999999996s)]
*  The negotiations were temporarily stalled after 60 days which was a totally arbitrary deadline [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=517.2s)]
*  put in place by President Trump anybody who has worked with the Iranians on this incredibly complex [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=525.76s)]
*  issue knows that it takes much longer than that to generate compromises but those opportunities [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=532.4s)]
*  for compromise may be extinguished by the American determination to support Israel's view [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=541.84s)]
*  that Iran should be denied its right under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty to research and [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=550.72s)]
*  develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes including enrichment of uranium to the 3.5% level [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=557.92s)]
*  necessary for power reactor fuel on its own territory. Now I hope although it's pretty [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=568.16s)]
*  far-fetched at this stage given American positions that they would reconsider that because ultimately [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=576.9599999999999s)]
*  if the Iranian regime survives which should be the presumption that everybody makes when considering [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=584.4s)]
*  the presumption that everybody makes when considering the next round of diplomacy [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=593.6s)]
*  if the Iranian regime survives then it's not going to surrender that point of principle [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=598.4s)]
*  that it cannot trust outside powers to supply it with uranium in perpetuity for its civil [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=606.0799999999999s)]
*  nuclear program. Now we had an excellent agreement the joint cooperative program of actions put in [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=616.4s)]
*  place in 2016 willfully destroyed by the Americans at Israeli behest and that kind of agreement needs [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=627.12s)]
*  to be restored under which unprecedented levels of control and monitoring of Iranian programs to [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=637.52s)]
*  ensure no diversion of material for military purposes can be put in place because I did [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=646.0s)]
*  there are compromises from the other side. Sir Richard Dalton thank you very much for coming on [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=653.84s)]
*  the program thank you. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm1OWBFD-W4&t=658.32s)]
