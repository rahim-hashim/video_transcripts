# Ros Atkins on... Donald Trump's plan for Greenland | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q73F6hEgnPg)
*  Dog sledding is popular in Greenland, perhaps less so in Washington, but there had been a plan for the US Vice President's wife, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q73F6hEgnPg&t=0.0s)]
*  Usha Vance, to attend Greenland's National Dog Sledding Championship. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q73F6hEgnPg&t=8.64s)]
*  National Security Advisor Mike Walz and Energy Secretary Chris Wright were also planning to visit Greenland. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q73F6hEgnPg&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Whether they're all fans of dog sledding or not, these plans were probably about this. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q73F6hEgnPg&t=19.36s)]
*  We need Greenland for national security and even international security. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q73F6hEgnPg&t=25.36s)]
*  And the sledding plan didn't go down well. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q73F6hEgnPg&t=30.96s)]
*  Greenland's outgoing Prime Minister said it showed very aggressive American pressure. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q73F6hEgnPg&t=33.2s)]
*  The Danish Prime Minister said it is clearly not a visit that Greenland needs or wants. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q73F6hEgnPg&t=37.36s)]
*  And the plan changed. The sledding is off and there's a new addition to the group. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q73F6hEgnPg&t=42.4s)]
*  You know there was so much excitement around Usha's visit to Greenland this Friday that I decided that I didn't want her to have all that fun by herself. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q73F6hEgnPg&t=46.96s)]
*  And so I'm going to join her. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q73F6hEgnPg&t=54.56s)]
*  The focus of the visit is now America's Bidufek Space Base in Greenland. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q73F6hEgnPg&t=56.0s)]
*  And while having fun and visiting the base may be part of this, it's not the full story. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q73F6hEgnPg&t=60.400000000000006s)]
*  Greenland is right between the US and Europe. It has huge value in terms of trade and security. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q73F6hEgnPg&t=65.44s)]
*  It has natural resources too, including minerals. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q73F6hEgnPg&t=71.6s)]
*  And Donald Trump thinks a deal would suit the US and Greenlanders, promising them billions of dollars to create new jobs and make you rich. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q73F6hEgnPg&t=74.72s)]
*  And this interest in Greenland isn't new. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q73F6hEgnPg&t=83.52s)]
*  In 2019, towards the end of his first term, Donald Trump said essentially it's a large real estate deal. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q73F6hEgnPg&t=86.16s)]
*  In December last year, he called ownership and control of Greenland an absolute necessity. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q73F6hEgnPg&t=92.64s)]
*  And in January, he added... [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q73F6hEgnPg&t=98.0s)]
*  People really don't even know if Denmark has any legal right to it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q73F6hEgnPg&t=100.32s)]
*  But if they do, they should give it up because we need it for national security. That's for the free world. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q73F6hEgnPg&t=105.28s)]
*  People do know Greenland's legal status. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q73F6hEgnPg&t=110.24s)]
*  It's an autonomous territory and is part of the Kingdom of Denmark. That's recognised under international law. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q73F6hEgnPg&t=112.8s)]
*  And there have been clear messages for the Trump administration. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q73F6hEgnPg&t=118.48s)]
*  Greenland's likely new leader says, we don't want to be Americans. No, we don't want to be Danes. We want to be Greenlanders. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q73F6hEgnPg&t=121.68s)]
*  Polling suggests 85% of people there don't want Greenland to become part of the US. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q73F6hEgnPg&t=128.64s)]
*  And there have been protests, some of the biggest ever seen in Greenland. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q73F6hEgnPg&t=134.24s)]
*  There's this hat too. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q73F6hEgnPg&t=138.4s)]
*  But Donald Trump and his colleagues have no intention of going away. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q73F6hEgnPg&t=141.04s)]
*  They want Greenland and this visit is another way of saying so. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q73F6hEgnPg&t=143.92s)]
