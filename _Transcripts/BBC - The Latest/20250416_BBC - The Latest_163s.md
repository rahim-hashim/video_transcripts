*  A federal judge has called on the Trump administration to give more information about what they're [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3geN_gT_nt4&t=0.0s)]
*  trying to do to bring back a man who was unlawfully deported to El Salvador. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3geN_gT_nt4&t=4.4s)]
*  Kilmer Abrego Garcia was mistakenly removed from the US in error last month and is being [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3geN_gT_nt4&t=9.52s)]
*  held in a maximum security prison. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3geN_gT_nt4&t=15.36s)]
*  His supporters gathered outside the courthouse on Tuesday after the White House was given [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3geN_gT_nt4&t=17.52s)]
*  a two-week deadline to provide documents related to his case. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3geN_gT_nt4&t=21.48s)]
*  Both President Trump and the President of El Salvador are refusing to have him returned [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3geN_gT_nt4&t=25.32s)]
*  to the US. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3geN_gT_nt4&t=30.48s)]
*  Let's speak to CBS correspondent Jared Hill who's looking at this story. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3geN_gT_nt4&t=31.48s)]
*  So something of a stalemate at the moment, Jared. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3geN_gT_nt4&t=36.08s)]
*  Jared That's right, Martini. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3geN_gT_nt4&t=38.6s)]
*  A lot of this centers around the interpretation of the language that has been given from the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3geN_gT_nt4&t=40.4s)]
*  Supreme Court in particular. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3geN_gT_nt4&t=45.56s)]
*  They're saying here that the Trump administration has to facilitate his return. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3geN_gT_nt4&t=47.84s)]
*  The administration, though, is arguing that the word facilitate in this context means [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3geN_gT_nt4&t=52.36s)]
*  just not obstruct. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3geN_gT_nt4&t=57.04s)]
*  Meanwhile, you have the President of El Salvador saying that he can't send Abrego Garcia back [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3geN_gT_nt4&t=58.28s)]
*  to the United States because he's not wanted in the United States. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3geN_gT_nt4&t=63.6s)]
*  And so his direct quote was actually, what would I do, smuggle him in. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3geN_gT_nt4&t=66.72s)]
*  All of this, though, goes back to this legal battle that is currently happening. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3geN_gT_nt4&t=70.76s)]
*  There's a judge who's over this case, a federal judge, who is now giving the Trump administration [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3geN_gT_nt4&t=74.16s)]
*  a couple of weeks to get together some members of the administration who are going to formally [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3geN_gT_nt4&t=79.2s)]
*  discuss with the judge and with the court whether they are actively working against [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3geN_gT_nt4&t=86.48s)]
*  her order to facilitate bringing Abrego Garcia back. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3geN_gT_nt4&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  Will this end in him coming back to the United States? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3geN_gT_nt4&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  Again, that's still yet to be seen. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3geN_gT_nt4&t=100.44s)]
*  What indication is there of what's actually going on behind the scenes to resolve this? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3geN_gT_nt4&t=102.2s)]
*  Well, I mean, the court proceedings are continuing here. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3geN_gT_nt4&t=107.68s)]
*  And as you mentioned, we are at a bit of a stalemate on both sides of this because the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3geN_gT_nt4&t=110.60000000000001s)]
*  administration is making an argument that Abrego Garcia was a person who was in the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3geN_gT_nt4&t=114.84s)]
*  country illegally, they say. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3geN_gT_nt4&t=120.44000000000001s)]
*  They also are saying that he is a member of the MS-13 gang. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3geN_gT_nt4&t=122.08000000000001s)]
*  All these reasons that they argue are why he either would have been deported or should [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3geN_gT_nt4&t=125.84s)]
*  have been deported, saying that there was a clerical or paperwork error with the reasoning [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3geN_gT_nt4&t=129.96s)]
*  that he was deported, they say, mistakenly to begin with. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3geN_gT_nt4&t=134.16s)]
*  This will be a big question, though, for the courts moving forward and potentially even [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3geN_gT_nt4&t=137.20000000000002s)]
*  the Supreme Court in the long term to see whether they are required to bring him back [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3geN_gT_nt4&t=141.36s)]
*  to the country. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3geN_gT_nt4&t=146.72s)]
*  All of this kind of big picture is seemingly a testing of President Trump's powers as the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3geN_gT_nt4&t=147.72s)]
*  president, as the executive, over things related to situations like deportations. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3geN_gT_nt4&t=154.4s)]
*  Jared, for the moment, thank you very much. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3geN_gT_nt4&t=159.04000000000002s)]
*  Jared Hill from CBS. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3geN_gT_nt4&t=161.44s)]
