Video Description: Yungblud, also known as Dom Harrison, is at the forefront of a new wave of British rock music that has gone global.
 
Speaking to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, he discussed his new music, heroes, the downside of fame, how he deals with online hate - and his own previously undisclosed political ambitions.
 
His new album, Idols, has just been released and it's his most personal to date. 
 
He also spoke about a social aspect of his festival 'Bludfest' in that he aims to make live music genuinely affordable to Gen Z, the young people for whom he's proud to be a spokesperson.

**BBC - The Latest:** [May 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM)
*  When you kind of go into the spotlight at such a young age, you never expect to become [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=0.0s)]
*  a polarizing figure. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=23.54s)]
*  I remember like, it was kind of not until I made this album did I realise how much maybe [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=25.08s)]
*  this journey's affected me. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=30.919999999999998s)]
*  Like things can be said under a post that you didn't even know you were insecure about [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=32.24s)]
*  until someone says them. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=39.64s)]
*  Is that what people think about me? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=40.64s)]
*  And I feel like this moment was a real point of self-reclamation about who am I now? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=42.599999999999994s)]
*  Are you out there? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=56.04s)]
*  Are you trying? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=59.04s)]
*  Are you patient? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=62.04s)]
*  Are you blind? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  Are you with me? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=68.03999999999999s)]
*  Against me? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  Don't know me at all? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  For a lot of people, Gen Z if you want to use that phrase, you have become a bit of [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=82.04s)]
*  a spokesperson, if you like, a bit of a symbol. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=88.04s)]
*  You know, you've always said you felt like a weirdo. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=91.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=93.04s)]
*  I know you're proud to represent or be a voice for people who find it hard to fit in. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=94.04s)]
*  I am, honestly, I am so proud of what we've created. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=100.04s)]
*  Obviously, when you start something like this, you never expect for it to become as important [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=106.04s)]
*  as it has been. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=114.04s)]
*  And I think the coolest thing is what I'm proud of is the aspect of community that this [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=115.04s)]
*  music has brought. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=121.04s)]
*  And one of the places where you're creating that, bringing people together, is your own [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=122.04s)]
*  festival. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=126.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=127.04s)]
*  I mean, you've even got your own festival now. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=128.04000000000002s)]
*  Completely. Wild. Wild. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=129.04000000000002s)]
*  Tell us about that. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=130.04s)]
*  And also, I'm really interested in the fact your festival is a fraction of the cost to [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=131.04s)]
*  go to as a lot of the other big festivals. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=137.04s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like music really became a thing of privilege and that should never be a thing [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=140.04s)]
*  in my opinion. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=148.04s)]
*  Like, if you can't see artists and bands, that's how I learned things. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=149.04s)]
*  That's how I made friends. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=156.04s)]
*  That's how I formed an identity. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=157.04s)]
*  And if young people can't go out and see things in the real world and go and make friends [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=158.04s)]
*  or go and find people with ideals that are mutual to them, like, that's scary to me. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=162.04s)]
*  The other thing that's different about it is it's so much cheaper than going to Glastonbury, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=169.04s)]
*  going to Redding, going to the other big festivals. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=174.04s)]
*  Why are you trying to do that and why is it important to you? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=177.04s)]
*  I feel like everyone, no matter their stature, deserves to be part of it. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=181.04s)]
*  Everyone's stature deserves a place to go and a great thing to experience. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=186.04s)]
*  And that's what we wanted to provide. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=191.04s)]
*  We literally like keep the tickets low, keep the experience beautiful, allow people to [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=193.04s)]
*  come together, bring in bands of new generation, old generation. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=199.04s)]
*  Do you think some of the festivals have got a bit out of hand? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=204.04s)]
*  100% [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=206.04s)]
*  You know, thousands of fans for fancy yurts. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=207.04s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm saying. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=209.04s)]
*  I feel like it's just, even being an artist, I'm like, this is just dumb. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=210.04s)]
*  It's just stupid. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=214.04s)]
*  It does not represent real people. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=215.04s)]
*  And I think like when we're playing a festival, like, and it's like, I cannot play a festival [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=217.04s)]
*  where it's like 800 quid a ticket. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=222.04s)]
*  How can you stand on stage and that's OK? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=224.04s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=229.04s)]
*  Like what? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=230.04s)]
*  Like it's just, that's just not my style. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=231.04s)]
*  And we wanted to come back and do 20 bands for 65 quid because that's the way it should be, I think. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=233.04s)]
*  And will you stand by that even if that means for you as an artist that you lose out on some big events potentially? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=240.04s)]
*  I think with it all, like, yeah, because I'll just make me own. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=246.04s)]
*  That's my vibe. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=251.04s)]
*  I'm literally just like, in this world, there is nothing you can't achieve if I believe you are doing it from a place of truth and for the right reason. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=252.04s)]
*  Like, to be honest, I was tired of what the festival market was. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=261.03999999999996s)]
*  I was tired that a lot of festival promoters didn't take me seriously. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=266.04s)]
*  So I was like, start me own. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=269.04s)]
*  Why not? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=272.04s)]
*  Let's make it and let's make a positive impact, a positive change and make something bigger than just us. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=273.04s)]
*  So not booking Coldplay for the Centrist ads? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=282.04s)]
*  I'd book Coldplay for that if they do it for like whatever. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=284.04s)]
*  I'm like, come on, do it for the right reason. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=287.04s)]
*  Come on, Chris, 65 quid a ticket, me and you, let's have it. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=289.04s)]
*  Let's then talk about some of the music that has helped, understood, developed your emotion, the things that you connect with. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=292.04s)]
*  So your new album is going to be called Idols. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=298.04s)]
*  Who are your idols? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=300.04s)]
*  Wow, definitely David Bowie, 100 percent. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=302.04s)]
*  100 percent. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=307.04s)]
*  I think the way that man really taught me fearlessness and almost an idea of if they don't know it yet or don't like it yet, they might do later. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=308.04s)]
*  If you're confident enough, you know, I mean, they'll probably be dressing like you in two years if you just stick at it. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=323.04s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=328.04s)]
*  Obviously, Ozzy Osbourne. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=329.04s)]
*  I think Ozzy was so integral to me because I was a loud, crazy, out of the box kid. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=331.04s)]
*  And he represented that idea. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=341.04s)]
*  And I remember just like seeing his glasses and his big mouth. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=346.04s)]
*  And I just had someone to identify with who would like allow me to embrace my madness or like never bottle that up. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=351.04s)]
*  And I think seen as that family have become really close to me in the years, like Sharon has always given me advice on like the festival and kind of how like again, like they'll get it later. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=358.04s)]
*  Do not dilute your madness. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=375.04s)]
*  Do not dilute your light. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=377.04s)]
*  Let it just emit. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=379.04s)]
*  And like people will love it. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=382.04s)]
*  People will hate it, but they will get it eventually. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=384.04s)]
*  If you if you just keep in yourself. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=386.04s)]
*  What about Mick Jagger? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=388.04s)]
*  I mean, we know he's noticed you at 80. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=389.04s)]
*  He's still going. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=392.04s)]
*  I love him. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=393.04s)]
*  Honestly, literally, like I remember going to see them at Anfield Stadium. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=394.04s)]
*  I would like to meet you. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=398.04s)]
*  It's crazy, man. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=400.04s)]
*  I think like literally just the staple of rock and roll and still doing it better than ever. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=401.04s)]
*  And I was just like, that is the that is the dream, isn't it, to be 75 or like nearly 80? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=411.04s)]
*  I think he is 80. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=417.04s)]
*  Like 80, like playing to a football stadium like he's 17. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=418.04s)]
*  You know, I mean, I just like music goes through him in a way that taught me a lot as a front man. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=422.04s)]
*  I remember people like, oh, you want to go see the Rolling Stones on it? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=427.04s)]
*  But I was like, one shot, I'm going to go see the Rolling Stones. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=430.04s)]
*  But he came on stage. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=434.04s)]
*  First three songs. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=435.04s)]
*  He's like, oh, fair. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=436.04s)]
*  All right. It was a bit like like tame by song five, six, seven. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=440.04s)]
*  He's ramping me up by song 12. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=446.04s)]
*  I'm like, whoa, by the end, he's got me. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=449.04s)]
*  And he knew exactly what he was doing. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=453.04s)]
*  He was like getting me up like the gears, man. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=455.04s)]
*  He got me knickers off by song 10. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=457.04s)]
*  I was like, I'm into it, man. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=459.04s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=460.04s)]
*  Learned a lot by that. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=461.04s)]
*  He was killer. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=462.04s)]
*  So what's the hardest moment being? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=464.04s)]
*  With huge success and huge fame comes massive pressure. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=466.04s)]
*  Hate is such a strange thing to deal with. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=470.04s)]
*  It's like it's never forget someone came to me in a pub in East London and just was like. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=475.04s)]
*  Was like your music is terrible and I don't believe you and I hate it. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=484.04s)]
*  And I think you can try and be like, like when you put in a situation like that, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=489.04s)]
*  you're like a wounded animal. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=495.04s)]
*  You kind of try and lick yourself and bring yourself back to it. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=496.04s)]
*  And you. I remember I was like 22 and I was trying to like how do I respond to this? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=500.04s)]
*  And I kind of was just like, oh, yeah, cool. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=506.04s)]
*  Like really shut down. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=508.04s)]
*  I think about that like probably once a week in. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=510.04s)]
*  But in this new position, I mean, is that you realize. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=513.04s)]
*  When someone throws something at you like that, when someone hates you or throws throws a [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=518.04s)]
*  dagger like that. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=524.04s)]
*  The only thing is in your control is if you allow them or you choose to give them [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=527.04s)]
*  the power of a reaction or allowing you to feel that to me, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=535.04s)]
*  like what I've learned now is whatever that person is going through, that's not in my control. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=540.04s)]
*  Only thing that's in my control is I allow that to affect me. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=544.04s)]
*  It's such a great communicator. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=547.04s)]
*  And you're obviously so interested in the world. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=549.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=551.04s)]
*  And want people to have a better life. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=552.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=555.04s)]
*  Would you go into politics? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=556.04s)]
*  You know, I have actually thought about that. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=557.04s)]
*  I know it's crazy. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=559.04s)]
*  It's not crazy. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=560.04s)]
*  I feel like you start something as a musician and then you kind of connect with people on a daily basis. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=561.04s)]
*  I always make an effort to see people outside the gigs and see people walk around a festival. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=569.04s)]
*  And this whole community was built on human connection about how people live and how people what people [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=574.04s)]
*  struggle with. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=581.04s)]
*  And I thought maybe one day I think I think I could do something that would be I could provide some good somewhere. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=582.04s)]
*  So, yeah, I think that has actually crossed my mind. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=590.04s)]
*  Young blood, the politician. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=594.04s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=595.04s)]
*  I'd stand up. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b342VVc1FMM&t=597.04s)]
