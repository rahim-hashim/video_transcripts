Video Description: The White House has confirmed that a journalist was inadvertently added to an insecure group chat in which leading US national security officials and the Vice-President JD Vance debated and planned a military strike in Yemen.

The Atlantic magazine's Jeffrey Goldberg was included on a Signal message group with Vice-President JD Vance and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth among its members.

He saw classified military plans for US strikes on Houthi rebels, including precise details of weapons packages, targets and timing, two hours before the first bombs struck.

Goldberg said he was added to the message chain, apparently by accident, after receiving a connection request from someone who appeared to be White House National Security Adviser Michael Waltz.

President Donald Trump told reporters that he was not aware of the Atlantic article.  "The attacks on the Houthis have been highly successful and effective," White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. "President Trump continues to have the utmost confidence in his national security team, including National Security Advisor Mike Waltz."

On 15 March the US launched what it described as a "decisive and powerful" series of air strikes against the Houthis in Yemen. Four days earlier, on 11 March, Atlantic editor-in-chief Goldberg says he received the connection request on the encrypted messaging app Signal from an account that purported to be Mr Waltz's.  Signal is used by journalists and Washington officials because of the secure nature of its communications, the ability to create aliases, and to send disappearing messages.

Two days later, Goldberg said he was added to a Signal chat entitled "Houthi PC small group." A number of accounts that appeared to belong to cabinet members and national security officials were included in the 18-person chat, Goldberg reported. Accounts labelled "JD Vance", the name of the vice-president; "Pete Hegseth," the defence secretary; and "John Ratcliffe," director of the Central Intelligence Agency; were among names in the chain. 

Top national security officials from various agencies also appeared in it, including Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's director of national intelligence, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

# Major US security blunder as Trump team shares top-secret war plans with journalist | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70)
*  The White House has confirmed it inadvertently added a US journalist to a private group chat [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=0.0s)]
*  discussing classified plans to bomb Yemen. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=6.78s)]
*  It's an extraordinary breach of security with America's entire national security team in [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=10.42s)]
*  the group, including the Vice President. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=15.18s)]
*  The journalist, Jeffrey Goldberg, was informed of the strikes two hours before they took [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=17.5s)]
*  place a little over a week ago. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=22.06s)]
*  Well, Sarah Smith is live in Washington with the very latest. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=24.02s)]
*  Sarah, Jeffrey Goldberg, he is the editor-in-chief of the Atlantic magazine and he's written [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=27.32s)]
*  at length about what beggars believe, being put in this secret chat group with the highest [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=32.28s)]
*  level authorities when it comes to America's national security. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=39.18s)]
*  I know, it's stunning, isn't it, that a messaging app like Signal could be used to talk about [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  military plans and absolutely shocking that a journalist could accidentally be added to [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=50.96s)]
*  this group of top national security officials. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=56.1s)]
*  These messages that he was able to read over several days in real time start off talking [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=60.06s)]
*  about possibly taking bombing action to protect shipping in the Suez Canal. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=63.98s)]
*  And JD Vance, the Vice President, is pretty skeptical because he says far fewer American [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=69.18s)]
*  ships use the canal than European ones. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=73.62s)]
*  So he writes in one message referencing Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=76.06s)]
*  He says, if you think we should do it, let's go. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=79.46000000000001s)]
*  I just hate bailing Europe out again. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=82.02s)]
*  And then the defense secretary responds, saying, I fully share your loathing of European [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=85.28s)]
*  freeloading. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=91.44s)]
*  It's pathetic. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=92.44s)]
*  And then the next day, the groups informed that the bombing raid has been a success and [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=93.44s)]
*  messages start flowing in. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=98.12s)]
*  From John Ratcliffe, the head of the CIA, he said it was a good start. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=99.4s)]
*  Then you've got Mike Waltz, the national security adviser, just using some emojis. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  MAR, we assume, is Marco Rubio, the secretary of state. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=108.12s)]
*  He says, good job, Pete, and your team. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=112.4s)]
*  Kudos to all. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=115.02s)]
*  Chimes in Suzie Wiles, the White House chief of staff, and then the presidential envoy, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=116.02s)]
*  Steve Wittkopf. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=120.86s)]
*  He's just got a few more emojis. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=121.86s)]
*  It's an astonishingly casual way of talking about a bombing raid which the Houthis say [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=123.82000000000001s)]
*  killed 53 people. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=128.74s)]
*  It's obviously a pretty big security breach as well. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=132.78s)]
*  President Trump was asked about it earlier and said he didn't actually know anything [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=135.58s)]
*  about this at all. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=138.34s)]
*  Having to do with what? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=139.34s)]
*  What were they talking about? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=141.26s)]
*  The Houthis. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=142.26s)]
*  The Houthis, you mean the attack on the Houthis? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=143.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=145.6s)]
*  Well, it couldn't have been very effective because the attack was very effective, I can [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=146.6s)]
*  tell you that. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=149.88s)]
*  I don't know anything about it. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=150.88s)]
*  You're telling me about it for the first time. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=151.88s)]
*  Now, the White House has confirmed that the messages are authentic. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=157.39999999999998s)]
*  So, I mean, this journalist really was accidentally added to this group. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=160.39999999999998s)]
*  And the White House press secretary has come out and said, well, the point is that the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=165.0s)]
*  attacks on the Houthi targets were successful and says that the president has every confidence [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=167.88s)]
*  in his national security team, despite this absolutely stunning security breach. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=173.5s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=177.5s)]
*  Sarah, thank you for that. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=178.5s)]
*  Sarah Smith, our North America editor, there live in Washington. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO3IZlBG70&t=179.98s)]
