*  Well, back here in Rome, the time is currently about quarter past two, and as I mentioned [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=0.0s)]
*  earlier that Pope Mobile made its way slowly through the streets from St Peter's Square [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=7.16s)]
*  behind me to the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  People lie in the streets to get a final glimpse, to say goodbye, if you like, to Pope Francis. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=17.0s)]
*  Later on we saw the coffin, a simple coffin made of wood and zinc, carried very respectfully, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=24.0s)]
*  very slowly by the pallbearers to the applause of the crowds. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=33.72s)]
*  I was there in the crowd, there was a respectful applause as that coffin was taken for a final [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  time up those beautiful marble steps in the blazing spring sunshine of this late April [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=44.64s)]
*  day. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=51.32s)]
*  It was a very simple coffin, beautifully made, beautifully handcrafted, but something that [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=52.32s)]
*  was very important to Pope Francis was that he was buried according to his own wishes. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=57.28s)]
*  Remember, in times gone by, popes used to be buried in nesting coffins, three layers [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=63.8s)]
*  of coffins made of cypress, made of lead and made of oak. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=70.03999999999999s)]
*  Pope Francis turned away from that and said in his final wishes that he wanted to be [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=76.32s)]
*  buried in a simple coffin and in a simple way because the tomb that he's being taken [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=84.32s)]
*  to in these pictures in Santa Maria Maggiore, it's a very beautiful one, but it's made [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=88.63999999999999s)]
*  of one type of marble with a very plain inscription, the word, the name, Franciscum, which is Latin [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=93.56s)]
*  for Francis. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=101.88s)]
*  The Italian for Francis is Francesco and as they took his coffin up those steps and back [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=102.88s)]
*  into St Peter's Basilica for the final time, when I was down there around me, so many people [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=107.96s)]
*  cried out, Grazie Francesco, which is Italian for thank you Francesco, and they applauded [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=113.39999999999999s)]
*  him. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=120.12s)]
*  Some people were actually crying as well. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=121.12s)]
*  It was a very intense and emotional moment. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=122.32s)]
*  For that intensity and that emotion has been replicated, I'm sure, around the world. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=125.91999999999999s)]
*  There are 1.4 billion Catholics globally, aren't there? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=130.84s)]
*  Our reporter Lola Sherrower has been at St George's Cathedral, it's a cathedral in London, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=135.32s)]
*  and she's been speaking to young Catholics about Pope Francis' legacy and hearing what [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=140.8s)]
*  his papacy meant to them. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=146.08s)]
*  This is a student priest, Mac, do you mind taking a step here? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  How are you feeling today, especially now the funeral has happened? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=153.64000000000001s)]
*  A mixture of emotions really. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=157.92s)]
*  Like, part of me is grateful, grateful that Pope Francis will be willing to take on the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=159.72s)]
*  chair of Peter, to govern the flock, but also hopefulness. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=166.35999999999999s)]
*  I've said it before, but as Christians we believe that to live with Christ means we [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=169.84s)]
*  must die with Christ, so while it might feel like the end isn't, we believe in hope in [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=175.32s)]
*  Christ's promise to take us to eternal life. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=181.92s)]
*  Throughout the time that we've spent together today, you have been leading prayer with your [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=185.2s)]
*  fellow community, how has that been for you? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think, I think it speaks for all of us when I say, you know, it's wonderful to [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=194.11999999999998s)]
*  stay connected with the Pope. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=201.2s)]
*  You know, as Christians and Catholics we believe now it's time for us to step up to our duty [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=202.2s)]
*  to pray for the Pope, you know, to pray for his soul, and it's not a better way to do [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=206.72s)]
*  it than the Rosary. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  We had a great devotion to Our Lady Mother of God, so it seems fitting to ask Kurt to [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=213.08s)]
*  intercede for him. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=216.8s)]
*  Thank you, Mac. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=217.8s)]
*  Daniela, what do you think the Pope's legacy is, especially for younger Christians like [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=219.8s)]
*  yourself gathered here today? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=224.92000000000002s)]
*  I think the main part of the Pope's legacy is, again, this constant turning back to Our [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=227.12s)]
*  Lady Mother of God, and to really be close to her. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=232.8s)]
*  I think it's so fitting that we saw the big funeral procession from St Peter's Basilica [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=236.64000000000001s)]
*  all the way down to Santa Maria Maggiore, where, you know, that's his final resting [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=242.07999999999998s)]
*  place. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=245.56s)]
*  I think he was such a faithful son with such a strong devotion to Our Lady. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=246.56s)]
*  I think that's really the lasting legacy for me. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=251.64s)]
*  I think it's such a really poignant resting place for him, and that was definitely his [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=254.68s)]
*  choice. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=259.48s)]
*  I think it was a perfect decision. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=260.48s)]
*  And Simran, what are the values that Pope Francis had that resonates with you the most [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=262.08s)]
*  still to this day? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=268.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=269.76s)]
*  So I think his values of being very humble. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=270.76s)]
*  I think I mentioned before that Christ has a duality of being the King of the universe [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=273.12s)]
*  and still being a servant, dying for us on the cross. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=277.76s)]
*  And I think Pope Francis did that beautifully well. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=281.2s)]
*  He was the Pope. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=284.36s)]
*  He reigned over the Catholic Church. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=285.36s)]
*  He sort of guided us through that and then still was a servant. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=287.56s)]
*  He lived very simply. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=293.12s)]
*  He served. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=294.76s)]
*  He went into the prison. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=295.76s)]
*  He washed feet. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=296.76s)]
*  Went into confession in front of everybody else and took confessions as well. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=298.24s)]
*  So I think his values of being very, very humble, no matter what position you're in, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=301.8s)]
*  will always stay with me and the rest of us as well. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=307.76s)]
*  Now, Michael, you and others here are actually here from New Zealand on a pilgrimage. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=311.12s)]
*  So it's your first time attending this church. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=315.52s)]
*  How have you found to today being surrounded by people who believe in the same thing that [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=318.48s)]
*  you do? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=323.71999999999997s)]
*  I think it's really beautiful to be here. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=324.71999999999997s)]
*  I think it's quite nice. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=326.64s)]
*  Anywhere you go in the world, the church feels like home. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=328.36s)]
*  Like, anywhere you go, there's always people to talk to. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=331.4s)]
*  I think it's been quite encouraging to see so many young people because I know for me, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=334.44s)]
*  going to church as a kid, you see a lot of older people. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=339.03999999999996s)]
*  And I think it's really promising just to see that new generation of the church. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=341.36s)]
*  But I also think that it's really interesting occasion, obviously, to be here as well with [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=346.59999999999997s)]
*  the Pope's funeral. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=351.91999999999996s)]
*  There's mixed emotions with that. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=353.92s)]
*  But I think it's been really beautiful just to be in a different part of the world, not [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=355.92s)]
*  even my hometown, and just share this time with other Catholics. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=361.0s)]
*  And Perpetua, tell me, what is the moment of Pope Francis's papacy that will stay with [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=365.84000000000003s)]
*  you? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=371.40000000000003s)]
*  So in 2023, I had the opportunity to attend World Youth Day in Lisbon with some of the [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=372.40000000000003s)]
*  people here with me. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=378.12s)]
*  And it was so beautiful to be able to hear the Pope speak to us about what our call is, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=379.42s)]
*  what our mission is, how we can strengthen our faith, and even to just watch him as he [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=384.38s)]
*  rode through the crowd and prayed with us and said mass with us. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=388.06s)]
*  It was just such a beautiful experience, and it's just one that I will carry for the rest [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=392.02000000000004s)]
*  of my life. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=395.46000000000004s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=396.46000000000004s)]
*  And Iona, you are on the youth team within London to kind of bring young Catholics together. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=397.46000000000004s)]
*  Have you seen under Pope Francis's papacy a rise in young Catholics coming together [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=403.48s)]
*  or people joining Catholicism? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=409.48s)]
*  Yeah, there's been a huge increase. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=411.0s)]
*  I have been astounded this year by just the number of people who are finding hope and [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=412.92s)]
*  joy in life in the church. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=418.04s)]
*  And I think one thing that, well, one reason for which that's happening is that Pope Francis [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=419.76s)]
*  encouraged us to be really rooted in the world we're living in at the same time as constantly [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=424.16s)]
*  keeping an eye towards heaven. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=429.40000000000003s)]
*  Today, we've been pointed towards heaven. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=430.84000000000003s)]
*  We can't live fully in this life without knowing what's coming. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=432.68s)]
*  And yeah, he encouraged us to be really rooted in the conversation politically that's happening [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=436.2s)]
*  all over the world. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=442.04s)]
*  We're a very, very politically active generation, and he showed us how to consecrate that and [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=443.04s)]
*  turn political activism into a great act of worship. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=447.88s)]
*  And I think that is something that it calls me to step up. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=451.6s)]
*  It calls me to get involved. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=454.92s)]
*  And it's something that I'm united with all my brothers and sisters around the world in [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=457.2s)]
*  that great act. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=461.28000000000003s)]
*  And that's something that I see young people being very excited to be a part of now when [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=462.28s)]
*  they start their journey in the church this year. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=467.03999999999996s)]
*  Did you feel united in this space today sharing prayer and thoughts and reflection about Pope [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=469.4s)]
*  Francis together? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=473.4s)]
*  Yeah, we've actually had some really beautiful times for prayer all together. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=474.4s)]
*  We had some time in Eucharistic adoration as well. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=477.76s)]
*  And that was a huge part of Pope Francis' mission, was to bring people to Jesus in the [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phmyMrw5leY&t=479.67999999999995s)]
