# How are benefits changing in the UK after the government's welfare reform bill passes? | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [July 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y)
*  Hello, you're live with BBC News, your voice, your BBC News. We're looking ahead to a major [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=0.0s)]
*  vote later today in the House of Commons on planned reforms to the welfare system. Now, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=10.24s)]
*  this is a hugely complex but also a hugely important story affecting thousands of people [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=16.12s)]
*  up and down the country. Now, one of the reasons this has been in the news so much is because [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=22.82s)]
*  of the number of twists and turns in this story and the number of changes to these reforms [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=27.54s)]
*  we've seen. It's been a big political challenge for the Prime Minister. That's one of the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=32.58s)]
*  elements to get into. I've got a fantastic line up of correspondents and editors joining [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=37.3s)]
*  us to get through this. One of them is here on set with me, Nicky Fox, our disability [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=43.620000000000005s)]
*  news correspondent. So good and so useful to have you here with us. Now, as I said, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=49.08s)]
*  this is both a complex but important news story. Talk us through some of the changes, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=54.26s)]
*  how the land lies at the minute and what the Prime Minister has proposed. Okay, well, let's [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  start off first, Rich, we're talking about personal independence payments and what they [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=65.36s)]
*  actually do. So PIP is a benefit designed to help cover the extra costs that disabled [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=69.62s)]
*  people face. And I mention that because I think that gets lost somewhat because we're [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=75.06s)]
*  hearing a lot, the government are talking a lot about getting more disabled people into [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=78.66s)]
*  work. But there are many people that get this extra cost benefit PIP who are in work [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=81.98s)]
*  and claiming PIP enables them to cover the extra costs of working and living. You know, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=87.06s)]
*  it's things like higher energy bills because some disabled people have to whack the heating [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=93.54s)]
*  on for much longer. It's expensive adaptations that aren't necessarily covered by the local [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=98.14s)]
*  authority, equipment that might not be covered by the NHS. So that's what it is. Now, the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=102.82000000000001s)]
*  original PIP assessment, as it stands, you score points from one to 12 and it's basically [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=107.34s)]
*  zero for no difficulty, 12 for the most difficulty. So a person claiming PIP could score fewer [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=113.66s)]
*  points across the board, so two points across the board and then get that entitlement to [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=121.82000000000001s)]
*  PIP. It's also worth mentioning PIP comes in two components. So you've got the daily [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=126.78s)]
*  living component and the mobility component. We're just focusing on the daily living component. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=130.54s)]
*  That's the only component that's being discussed here at the moment. The changes, the government [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=135.62s)]
*  want to implement changes which will come into effect in November 2026, which would [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=141.06s)]
*  mean that a person who's claiming for PIP would have to score a minimum of four points. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=145.70000000000002s)]
*  So one of those questions, and those questions are about whether you can wash and dress unaided, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=150.94s)]
*  about tasks like preparing and eating food, a person will have to get four points minimum [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=157.02s)]
*  to be able to score enough points to get the daily living component of PIP. So it's quite [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=163.14000000000001s)]
*  a big change for people that might have less complex, less severe needs, that might score [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=169.58s)]
*  a fewer number of points across the board. So that's the big change. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=177.3s)]
*  This is hugely confusing. I mean, we were discussing before you came on, you live and [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=181.5s)]
*  breathe this. You focus it on it every day. You reported it for the BBC and you have been [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=185.54s)]
*  struggling to get your heads around some of the complexities here. How can the government [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=190.98s)]
*  expect people who are also trying to hold down a job, raise a family, deal with living [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=195.1s)]
*  with their disability and also understand what's going on here? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=199.85999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's so confusing and I've been speaking to other colleagues, other disability journalists [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=204.06s)]
*  as well and we're all saying the same thing. We know this system, this is our job, but [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=207.94s)]
*  it somehow gets more confusing. So I understand why we're having so many questions come into [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=213.06s)]
*  the BBC, why I'm getting so many questions from disabled people as to what is going on [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=219.78s)]
*  and how it will impact them, these changes, because PIP has always been that kind of holy [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=224.10000000000002s)]
*  grade of benefits for disabled people. It is an extra cost benefit. It isn't an out [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=229.74s)]
*  of work benefit. Life is more expensive if you're disabled and that is just a fact. We [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=235.5s)]
*  were saying earlier, when we scoped estimates that it's over a grand more expensive to be [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=241.3s)]
*  disabled than it is if you're not and that's set to rise as well. So it is a very important [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=245.78s)]
*  benefit and these changes, although they are becoming clearer and I have more information, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=252.7s)]
*  you know, I spent the weekend trying to get it, it is still very confusing. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=258.58s)]
*  Yeah, Nicky, really useful to have you here. Stick with us. Let's talk to Henry Zefferman, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=263.3s)]
*  now our chief political correspondent. Henry, good to have you with us. Nicky, they're talking [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=268.3s)]
*  us through some of the complexities to this hugely important system that thousands of [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=273.82s)]
*  people rely on. First, perhaps most obvious question, why is the Prime Minister doing [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=278.82s)]
*  this? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=283.5s)]
*  Well, there's a couple of arguments that the government advance for reform here and they [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=284.5s)]
*  would use the word reform, but of course their critics, including within the Labour Party, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=289.98s)]
*  would use the word cuts. Now, one is that they say, look, the numbers of people who [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=294.14s)]
*  are out of work, and I appreciate, by the way, that not everyone affected by this receives [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=299.82s)]
*  benefits that are related to whether they're in work or not, but just I'm just rehearsing [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=307.06s)]
*  the government's argument. They say that the number of people out of work is staggering. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=311.74s)]
*  The way in which that is projected to rise is staggering. And they say, well, look, the [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=317.58s)]
*  reforms that they propose are only designed to slow the rate of increase in the government's [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=322.86s)]
*  overall welfare spending, as well as the government's spending on various specific [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=329.04s)]
*  benefits. And the government therefore says this is a problem that a party of labour, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=334.44s)]
*  it's in their name, a party of work exists to solve, trying to find ways to get people [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=339.92s)]
*  who are currently out of work due to ill health into work. But there's another undeniable [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=345.24s)]
*  element to this. And it tells you a little bit about the timing of why this was announced [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=351.04s)]
*  and why it was announced in the spring to coincide with a particular fiscal, that's [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=355.56s)]
*  to say economic issue that Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, had to solve. And that is [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=360.44s)]
*  that the government needed to save money in order to meet its own borrowing rules, its [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=365.0s)]
*  own rules about how it balances day to day spending with the amount of money that's coming [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=370.8s)]
*  in to the exchequer. And it's kind of that complex mishmash of all sorts of different [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=375.16s)]
*  things going on, all sorts of different arguments, all sorts of different justifications, all [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=380.44s)]
*  sorts of different problems as the government would see it to solve that I think has contributed [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=383.76s)]
*  to the real political difficulty that the prime minister and his government find themselves [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=388.2s)]
*  in on this specific piece of legislation today. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=392.32s)]
*  Yeah, and we can talk more about the money later, but the number thrown around by Liz [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=395.0s)]
*  Kendall was more than £5 billion she's looking to save. We are expecting a debate on these [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=399.71999999999997s)]
*  welfare reforms in the House of Commons at 1.30 this afternoon. The vote itself is at [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=406.48s)]
*  7pm. We will have special coverage of that here across the BBC. Henry, stick with us [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=412.96s)]
*  for now. Nikki, for the moment, you mentioned earlier this key date, November next year. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=417.15999999999997s)]
*  Why is that significant? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=422.88s)]
*  November 2026. Well, that is the date that they have said that all new claimants will [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=423.88s)]
*  be subject to these rules. So, you know, there's going to be a review. So Stephen Tims, the [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=428.91999999999996s)]
*  minister for disabled people, who I met only a couple of weeks ago, will be heading up [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=434.24s)]
*  a review. There has been a consultation, although not a consultation on the changes [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=437.88s)]
*  to PIP. That was a consultation about delaying the health top-up of universal credit, which [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=442.96000000000004s)]
*  is an out-of-work benefit. They want to delay that so people who are under 22 can't get [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=448.88s)]
*  it. Also, the switch from disability living allowance to PIP, that was also consulted [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=453.44s)]
*  on. So disability living allowance is basically PIP. Some adults are still on disability living [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=458.2s)]
*  allowance and haven't been switched over. Younger people get disability living allowance [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=463.84s)]
*  before they go to PIP. So we're consulting on that. But there are still, you know, that [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=467.91999999999996s)]
*  consultation ended only yesterday and we've got the universal credit PIP bill. So there's [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=472.59999999999997s)]
*  still a lot of unanswered questions. But November 26 is the date that's etched in my brain at [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=477.15999999999997s)]
*  the moment because that is the date where the government proposed to change the PIP [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=484.15999999999997s)]
*  assessment. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=488.03999999999996s)]
*  OK, Henry, back to you, if I can, for the time being. We mentioned earlier on the challenges [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=489.04s)]
*  that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has seen over this. He came in with a thumping majority [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=494.12s)]
*  and now he's seeing a serious challenge to his power in the House of Commons. Talk us [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=499.32s)]
*  through the opposition he's had, especially from his own MPs. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=504.36s)]
*  I mean, it's completely staggering. If you'd asked me, but if you'd asked pretty much anyone [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=508.36s)]
*  on July 5th, 2024, i.e. the day that Sir Keir Starmer became Prime Minister, we'd have said [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=513.4s)]
*  there's practically no chance of Sir Keir Starmer ever losing a vote in Parliament before the [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=520.4s)]
*  next general election, because that's just how the parliamentary arithmetic works. It's [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=526.4s)]
*  not just a big majority, it's one of the biggest majorities in post-war British political history. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=530.0s)]
*  And yet we saw the government conceding a significant amount of ground on this legislation [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=535.88s)]
*  late last week because they took the view, rightly, clearly, that they were set to lose [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=541.1s)]
*  the vote as it stood, that the number of Labour MPs who had indicated either publicly or in [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=548.02s)]
*  some cases privately that they would vote against the government as it stood was so [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=554.1800000000001s)]
*  high. So the question now for the government today is what the impact of those concessions [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=558.82s)]
*  has been. I think the assumption in government was that once they made the concessions, which [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=564.5s)]
*  is to say making it so that existing claimants of personal independence payment remain receiving [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=570.94s)]
*  the same eligibility for that benefit before these changes come into effect and only future [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=580.0200000000001s)]
*  claimants are affected. I think the government assumed that in making that announcement the [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=585.7800000000001s)]
*  rebellion would melt away. Not so. On the contrary, there are still dozens of Labour [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=590.0s)]
*  MPs who are willing to vote against the government on this. And I have to say, I think most of [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=596.9s)]
*  us this morning thought that there was almost no chance that the government would still [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=601.9399999999999s)]
*  lose. But actually I'm picking up pessimistic vibes from government, some people with awareness [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=606.26s)]
*  of the parliamentary arithmetic in government. So it's just worth keeping an eye, I think, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=613.72s)]
*  even still on how the parliamentary maths progresses between now and that crucial vote, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=617.86s)]
*  as you say, which is at 7pm. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=622.74s)]
*  Without meaning to sound like we're pouring cold water over this, these reforms do have [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=624.58s)]
*  support and there are many people, for example the business secretary Jonathan Reynolds, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=629.5s)]
*  telling the BBC the changes are better than the current system. Many people want to see [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=634.26s)]
*  these changes go through, Henry. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=638.98s)]
*  Yeah, and many Labour MPs. Jonathan Reynolds is a government minister, so he was out. The [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=640.78s)]
*  way things work is that he was out talking about a different announcement this morning [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=645.62s)]
*  and then collective cabinet responsibility requires him to throw his weight behind the [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=649.54s)]
*  reforms, although of course he supports them anyway, I'm sure. But the reason I make that [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=653.5s)]
*  point is because there are actually a lot of Labour MPs who are not required to support [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=658.06s)]
*  the government on this, who really support the government and were furious. Not necessarily [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=661.5s)]
*  that the government conceded last week, because that was inevitable by that point given the [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=666.8199999999999s)]
*  scale of the rebellion, but they were furious with their colleagues who had joined on to [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=671.14s)]
*  that rebellion against the government, saying it was a sign of lack of seriousness from [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=675.38s)]
*  MPs so early in Kiyosudama's government that they owed more loyalty to the man who led [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=679.5s)]
*  the election campaign on which they were elected, so many of these MPs, for the first time in [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=684.38s)]
*  2024. So I think you really can't underestimate the amount of bad blood that's kind of swilling [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=690.18s)]
*  around the parliamentary Labour Party at the moment in every which direction. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=696.5s)]
*  Henry, thank you for now. Let's bring in Faisal Islam, our economics editor, to talk through [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=701.38s)]
*  some of the bigger picture on this. Faisal, good morning, good to see you. Liz Kendall, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=707.34s)]
*  the work and pensions secretary, has got a lot of money she needs to save, the figure [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=712.62s)]
*  of £5 billion has been thrown around. Talk us through the scale of what's at stake here. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=717.58s)]
*  So this is precisely the issue. In fact, if we take a step back, there is a really reasonable [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=725.34s)]
*  question is this, which is what is the government trying to achieve here? And they say it's [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=730.62s)]
*  welfare reform, and indeed there was a very detailed green paper on that subject, a consultation [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=735.62s)]
*  paper essentially with a whole suite of policies, but what happened was that those plans were [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=741.6600000000001s)]
*  pulled forward and sort of meshed together with a requirement, a separate requirement [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=748.9399999999999s)]
*  to make some budget cuts to hit the Chancellor's budget target at the spring statement in March [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=757.26s)]
*  and to help bridge a gap that appeared in the public finances against the Chancellor's [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=763.86s)]
*  own limits on borrowing. So why does that matter? Actually, there's a lot of common [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=770.14s)]
*  ground here from all sections of the government, actually Parliament, employers and some campaigning [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=776.08s)]
*  groups. People don't think in principle so many, particularly young people, should be [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=784.12s)]
*  in receipt of these benefits. It would be much better for everybody if they were in [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=790.4s)]
*  a job. It would be better for them, it would be better for the taxpayer, it would be better [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=795.16s)]
*  for the economy, because it's a total disaster to have in particular young people not making [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=798.68s)]
*  that first attachment to the jobs market. So there's some common ground here. I think [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=804.12s)]
*  where they got onto a sticky wicket as regards the rebellion, perhaps not the rebellion today, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=809.24s)]
*  but certainly the one last week, the likes of Treasury Select Committee Chair Meg Hillier [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=815.48s)]
*  and other chairs, where it got so big, was that it was clearly the motivation at first [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=819.28s)]
*  bite was to get that money back in. Whereas if you're trying to save that money long term, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=826.28s)]
*  the argument would be you go for reform that means that the money's not required at some [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=833.1999999999999s)]
*  point. The problem there was that the Office of Budget Responsibility would not score that [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=838.0799999999999s)]
*  as a saving and it wouldn't count towards your effort to get your budget into line. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=843.24s)]
*  So that, if you like, is the story of what happened in terms of the government. The issue [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=848.24s)]
*  is, underlying all of this is a significant rise in the number of claims, more than expected. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=855.24s)]
*  A lot of people tally that with what happened during the pandemic. This is both in terms [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=861.4s)]
*  of physical illness and disability, musculoskeletal issues that have taken people out of the labour [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=866.48s)]
*  market, but also mental health, particularly with young people, has gone up much more than [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=874.84s)]
*  anybody had expected. So the total bill in this area, which was £36 billion before the [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=880.52s)]
*  pandemic, is heading for something like £70 billion and they wanted to lop £5 billion [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=886.0s)]
*  off that. As a result of the compromises, they've rolled back about half of that. So [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=890.48s)]
*  that is, if you like, the fundamental challenge is the prevalence of this. So there's a couple [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=896.48s)]
*  of big questions here, I think, that aren't necessarily being answered. When the support [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=901.48s)]
*  system, the generous support system, was put in place for dealing with disability, was [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=906.9200000000001s)]
*  it always intended that there would be equivalent payments for those suffering from mental health [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=912.7600000000001s)]
*  issues? And then another issue that's actually been raised in the Green Paper and is raised [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=919.96s)]
*  by others in the think tank world is, are cash payments the right form of support for [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=925.96s)]
*  those with mental health problems or neurological issues? Is that the right level of support? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=931.96s)]
*  Is some sort of therapy, in-kind support? They do this differently in other countries. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=938.96s)]
*  And one last thing, there is an example of a country that's dealt with this problem and [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=944.72s)]
*  turned it round, which was the Netherlands 25 years ago. Now, their solution was to get [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=949.12s)]
*  employers, essentially, to pay for the first two years of support. Now, I don't think that [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=954.4000000000001s)]
*  that would go here in the UK. Employers are feeling quite sort of hard done by right now [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=959.48s)]
*  and indeed, many of the claimants, we're told, in the UK, they don't have that first rung [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=965.64s)]
*  on the job's ladder to have an employer to pay. So there are other examples from around [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=971.82s)]
*  the world and particularly around Europe. It is a key structural problem with significant [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=976.7s)]
*  consequences, not just for the individuals concerned, but for the economy and for the [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=981.34s)]
*  public finances. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=986.34s)]
*  Faisal, very good point there. You make lots of people trying to get their head around [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=987.34s)]
*  the complexities of that. We were discussing that with Nikki Foxx, our Disability News [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=991.0600000000001s)]
*  correspondent earlier. Nikki, you were at protests yesterday down near Parliament. I'm [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=995.14s)]
*  curious to hear what people there were saying. But first of all, I would like to take this [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1001.58s)]
*  question from James, which has been sent in. Will people going through their PIP review, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1005.02s)]
*  typically every three years, be classed as new claimants? James says this needs to be [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1010.14s)]
*  clarified, else it could just be a ruse to delay implementation of the original proposal. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1014.34s)]
*  I've read numerous reports on the amendment but can't see anything specific on this important [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1019.42s)]
*  point. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1023.46s)]
*  Yeah, no, this is a question that I have been asked a lot and I've spent the past few days [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1024.46s)]
*  trying to get to the bottom of it because as someone will know, when you get your personal [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1030.3s)]
*  independence payment reward, there'll be an end date. Some people might get that award [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1035.3799999999999s)]
*  for one year, for two years, some might get it for 10 years. It kind of depends on your [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1039.34s)]
*  disability and how your disability impacts you. But mostly there will be an end date [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1044.3799999999999s)]
*  and when you get to that end date, you will need to be reassessed. So we are hearing from [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1049.78s)]
*  the government, we've heard from the government, obviously these concessions, the existing [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1056.1s)]
*  PIP claimants will be protected but as Jane mentioned, as Jane was net mentioned, that [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1059.7s)]
*  if somebody that's claiming PIP now gets reassessed, in let's just say December 2030, are they [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1066.26s)]
*  going to get reassessed under the existing rules now and not the new four point minimum [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1073.58s)]
*  criteria? And the DWP has confirmed that existing claimants of PIP now, regardless of when they [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1079.5s)]
*  get reassessed, if it's after November 2026, will be reassessed under the existing rules. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1086.62s)]
*  They will not be reassessed under the new four point minimum requirement and that's [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1092.66s)]
*  very important. I want to be really clear about that because there's so much concern [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1097.78s)]
*  around that. I mean there's also the argument, you know, the people we met yesterday, one [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1102.5s)]
*  person I spoke to, Adam, he works for Inclusion London, I've met him before, he's brilliant [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1108.18s)]
*  and he was saying, you know, he just doesn't agree with the two tier system, he was saying, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1112.98s)]
*  you know, it doesn't make me happy that I'm going to be protected but future disabled [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1117.98s)]
*  people are and that is an argument that I'm hearing a lot of but then I sat down with [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1123.14s)]
*  the Ministry for Disabled People only a couple of weeks ago who said something does have [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1127.38s)]
*  to change as we've touched on today, that people with the greater need should have PIP [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1131.22s)]
*  and it should be there for a long time and actually the current system is unsustainable. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1137.74s)]
*  Okay, thank you for that. I want to go to Henry Zefferman now, our Chief Political Correspondent. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1143.18s)]
*  Henry, we've had this question coming in to us from the BBC News Instagram. Why do this [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1147.9s)]
*  instead of say an energy windfall tax? Windfall tax on oil and gas companies, though you could [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1153.58s)]
*  increase the rate. I mean I think what is absolutely the case and what that question [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1161.66s)]
*  reflects is that there are lots of people in the Labour Party, lots of Labour MPs who would sooner [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1166.86s)]
*  do many other things and generate revenue for the government many other ways than by cutting [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1173.02s)]
*  welfare spending and that's really what we're seeing in this rebellion and I think what you [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1179.1799999999998s)]
*  will see, especially after the concessions last week, is even more talk here in Westminster that [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1184.2199999999998s)]
*  in the budget, which will come in the autumn from Rachel Reeves, the Chancellor, the government will [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1191.74s)]
*  increase tax in some ways and I think it's going to be a very interesting [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1196.6200000000001s)]
*  process to see what taxes the government might alight on. I mean Pfizer will know that better [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1203.02s)]
*  than me, although what there is a real resistance to in the Treasury and in the Cabinet, people I [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1207.98s)]
*  speak to, is this idea that they say some of their colleagues, including Labour MPs, have which is [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1214.7s)]
*  that there is some magical quick fix, be it a wealth tax or some other tax, which would instantly [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1220.7s)]
*  all of the difficult economic problems that they face go away. That is not the dominant [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1226.22s)]
*  mode of thinking in Downing Street, be that number 10 or number 11. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1231.02s)]
*  And Henry, talk us through the mechanics of today. We said there's a debate at 1.30, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1235.34s)]
*  the vote at 7. What are you watching for? [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1240.46s)]
*  Well it won't just be one vote probably. So the amendment, it's called a reasoned amendment and [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1243.34s)]
*  you might hear the word amendment and think, ah so it's a tweak, it's not actually. This is one of [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1249.74s)]
*  those examples where parliamentary language just doesn't really match up with what's actually [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1253.98s)]
*  happening. It's a wrecking amendment. What it would do is it would stop this piece of legislation [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1257.58s)]
*  at this stage. That's the amendment that we've been talking about earlier, which has been tabled by [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1262.54s)]
*  Rachel Maskell, a Labour MP, and signed up to by a further 38 Labour MPs. It's not certain that [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1266.7s)]
*  that amendment will even be voted on. That's up to the Speaker of the House of Commons, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1273.66s)]
*  Céline Ziohoyle. I think it's probable that he will choose it to have a vote, but I don't think [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1277.98s)]
*  it's definite. We'll find out on that at the start of the debate. So we'll actually know that [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1282.46s)]
*  early on. Then there'll be hours of debate and it'll be fascinating to see what individual Labour [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1287.82s)]
*  MPs contribute to that debate. Whether we get an indication of the way in which the mood of the [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1292.6200000000001s)]
*  House of Commons might be turning, and in particular the mood of Labour MPs. Then come 7, you will [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1297.18s)]
*  probably have a vote on that Rachel Maskell amendment. If that passes, that's it. The [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1304.14s)]
*  government has lost. If it falls, that is to say if it doesn't get a majority support, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1309.8999999999999s)]
*  then you're on to the main vote, which is a big yes or no vote on the principles of what the [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1314.78s)]
*  government is proposing here. Okay, Henry, thank you. To Faisal Islam now, our economics editor, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1319.5s)]
*  big question, potentially the biggest question. What is the government's fiscal position? [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1325.74s)]
*  How can we ever reduce government debt? That question coming to us via the BBC News TikTok. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1329.82s)]
*  Well, they would argue, and certainly the Treasury and the Chancellor would argue, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1334.6200000000001s)]
*  this is why they have to be so careful. This is why originally they were looking for some savings [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1339.18s)]
*  in this area. They argue the bill is unsustainable. So you have to do something about that. Certainly, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1345.2600000000002s)]
*  I think if you take a step back, what you get is the message that there's a whole lot of things [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1353.5s)]
*  they can't do. They've ruled out various large tax levers as a result of their manifesto. They've [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1357.66s)]
*  ruled out doing anything with the triple lock on pensions, which is obviously a significant part [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1363.66s)]
*  of what is deemed to be, and I know that recipients of the state pension would grumble with this, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1368.46s)]
*  but was deemed to be part of the overall welfare budget. That's not to be touched. They've got this [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1373.26s)]
*  commitment to defence. We're told even in this area where they were trying to make savings, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1380.46s)]
*  nothing can happen to anybody currently in receipt of such benefits. All of those have to be kept the [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1386.54s)]
*  same. So you look for sort of flexibilities, ways that they can respond to changing events around the [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1392.3s)]
*  world, and it does look quite tricky. It goes back to this point of the Chancellor came in a year ago, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1400.1399999999999s)]
*  the Prime Minister came in a year ago, and they put in place these rules, these borrowing rules, [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1409.34s)]
*  what we call the physical rules. The target moves depending on what's happening in the world in [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1413.58s)]
*  terms of the economy, what's happening to the rate of interest that's charged to governments, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1421.9s)]
*  and it was actually a shift in that rate of interest, probably largely driven actually [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1426.46s)]
*  by what was happening in America with the tariff shock that the Chancellor responded to with this [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1431.18s)]
*  set of proposals that she's now had to half U-turn on. That process starts again, and that's what [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1437.42s)]
*  Henry was referring to with the budget. The gap is opening up. I think most forecasters think [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1443.26s)]
*  that if everything is left equal, about four and a half billion pounds worth of U-turns, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1449.26s)]
*  if you include the winter fuel U-turn as well, and then changes to forecasts leaves a gap of, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1453.9s)]
*  and this is an estimate, of 10 billion-ish, which would take a notable significant tax rise of some [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1459.74s)]
*  sort, and the sort of favourite proposal for that is the idea that you extend the freeze in income [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1467.8200000000002s)]
*  tax thresholds to raise those sorts of sums. No certainty in that, but yes, that's the challenge [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1476.78s)]
*  in terms of balancing the books that the Chancellor says she is sort of seized with right now. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1482.7s)]
*  Faisal Islam, thank you so much for talking us through that. Faisal Islam, our economics [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1488.94s)]
*  editor there. We're also joined by Henry Zefferman, our chief political correspondent. Henry, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1493.5s)]
*  thank you very much for joining us and with me on set here, Nicky Fox, our disability news [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1497.98s)]
*  correspondent. Nicky, thank you so much. As discussed, a hugely complex but also a hugely [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1502.46s)]
*  important story. We'll be covering it live for the rest of the day across BBC News, including the [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1508.14s)]
*  debate at 13.30 and the vote itself at 7pm. You can follow it all on BBC News. Thank you for now. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdHsUX3Jf5Y&t=1514.54s)]
