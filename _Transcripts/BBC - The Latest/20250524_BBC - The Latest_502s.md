# Children among dead after Israeli strikes on Khan Younis, says hospital | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ)
*  Israeli airstrikes in Gaza have hit the home of a doctor from the Nasser Hospital in Khan [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Younis in southern Gaza, killing nine of her 10 children. The doctor's husband is also [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=6.1000000000000005s)]
*  critically wounded. The Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis says its pediatric doctor, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=11.700000000000001s)]
*  Alaa Al-Najjar, was on duty when the bodies of her own children were brought in. Her colleagues [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=18.32s)]
*  posted this video on Instagram late last night. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=24.2s)]
*  The last patient on my list today was an 11 year old boy who seemed much younger as we lifted him onto the operating table. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=28.3s)]
*  His injuries were bad enough, but the background I think was worse. In an attack that may or [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=35.3s)]
*  not have been aimed at his father, his father was very badly injured, but nine of his brothers [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=45.0s)]
*  and sisters were killed. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=51.46s)]
*  And his mum is a pediatrician at the hospital and I was sent a video of him going to the house. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=53.62s)]
*  They lived opposite a petrol station so I don't know whether the bomb set off some massive fire, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=63.620000000000005s)]
*  but the video shows all of the children being pulled out of the fire and they're absolutely [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=70.62s)]
*  charred for what they're doing. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=76.62s)]
*  I think it is unimaginable that for that poor woman, both of them are doctors here. The father was a physician [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=80.78s)]
*  here at the Nasser Hospital. We've asked about him. He had no political and no military connections. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=92.78s)]
*  He doesn't seem to be prominent on social media and yet his poor wife is the only uninjured one [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=99.78s)]
*  who has the prospect of losing her husband, has already lost. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=106.94s)]
*  He's eight years old. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=111.94s)]
*  Right, yes. I think a particularly sad day, but that is the light in Gaza's present. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=113.94s)]
*  That's the way it goes in Gaza, isn't it? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=122.94s)]
*  But it is, we do say thank you for those of us, for those who allow us to be here and we're very grateful [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=126.1s)]
*  because it's important in this darkest of dark eras to stand with the oppressed. Thank you. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=137.1s)]
*  Those were the colleagues of Dr. Aladea. Well, let's bring in our correspondent, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=146.1s)]
*  Dr. Aladea Davies, who's in Jerusalem. And Wera, you've been following this story for us. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=151.26s)]
*  What do you know about this strike on Dr. Aladea's home? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=157.26s)]
*  Well, look, this is one of the most egregious, horrific incidents of the war since Israel escalated its war in Gaza. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=162.26s)]
*  We've asked the Israeli military, the IDF, for confirmation of reports that this was as a result of an airstrike [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=171.26s)]
*  on the family's home, but they've not got back to us yet to either confirm or deny them. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=179.42s)]
*  But this is a terrible thing. It has shocked everybody. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=184.42s)]
*  Many people have said it's the kind of incident that ordinarily might bring about calls for fighting to stop, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=189.42s)]
*  for people to come to their senses. But there's no sign of that happening. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=196.42s)]
*  Israel, of course, has said that the war in Gaza will continue until Hamas is completely defeated. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=199.42s)]
*  It comes against the backdrop, of course, of an increased Israeli military operation called Gideon's Chariots, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=206.57999999999998s)]
*  in which Israel is promising to control much of Gaza. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=212.57999999999998s)]
*  Residents in the town of Charnunis, where this happened, have been told on many occasions to leave their home [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=216.57999999999998s)]
*  and go to so-called safe areas, but there are no real safe areas in southern Gaza at the minute. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=222.57999999999998s)]
*  And I think, sadly, as somebody else said, this is now, despite its horrific nature of what has happened, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=228.57999999999998s)]
*  it is something that has been seen in Gaza before and may be seen in Gaza again. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=235.74s)]
*  And what do you think the likely fallout will be from this attack? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=240.74s)]
*  Because you're saying it's an attack that's shocked everyone there. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=245.74s)]
*  Well, as I said, the Israelis haven't confirmed or denied what has happened yet. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=250.74s)]
*  They haven't said what their target is. They always say that when they do have an airstrike [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=255.74s)]
*  or an attack from the ground, they're attacking Hamas targets. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=261.90000000000003s)]
*  We'll see what they have to say about this one. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=266.90000000000003s)]
*  But again, according to reports from people who knew this couple, they were both doctors. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=268.90000000000003s)]
*  They were not politically affiliated. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=272.90000000000003s)]
*  It is not known if their house was the intended target of a strike, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=275.90000000000003s)]
*  but that will, most details will hopefully come out as the day progresses. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=279.90000000000003s)]
*  We're a thank you. That's our correspondent, We're a Davies. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=285.90000000000003s)]
*  There live in Jerusalem. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=289.06s)]
*  Now let's speak to Ahmed Bayram, media and communications advisor for the Norwegian Refugee Council, Middle East. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=292.06s)]
*  Thank you for joining us on BBC News. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=299.06s)]
*  We continue to monitor the situation there in Gaza, of course, Israel's renewed offensive there. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=302.06s)]
*  But crucially, those efforts to get aid in after Israel partially lifted this 11 week blockade of the territory. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=307.06s)]
*  What can you tell us in terms of aid that's perhaps getting to Gazans at the moment? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=315.22s)]
*  A lot of this aid is, of course, being looted on the way. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=320.22s)]
*  I should start with that because last night my colleague was telling me that yet more trucks were taken away. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=326.22s)]
*  Of course, that's a direct result of the breakdown of law and order. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=333.22s)]
*  The other risk, of course, is that if Israel continues with this drip, drip kind of strategy, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=337.22s)]
*  you know, allowing aid in very small numbers, it only means that it will add to the anxiety, the desperation of people. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=344.38000000000005s)]
*  Some aid is getting to some areas, mainly central and southern Gaza, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=352.38000000000005s)]
*  while the north is completely blocked and completely deprived of anything. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=357.38000000000005s)]
*  I mean, today, again, she was telling me about how one kilogram of onions is now costing her fifty five dollars. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=361.38000000000005s)]
*  Of course, that's fifty five dollars that so many people don't have or can't afford. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=371.54s)]
*  The numbers don't make sense anymore because the markets are empty and people can't live on more than one meal a day. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=376.54s)]
*  So what we need to see is gushing of aid, not just a few trucks here and there that will get looted or face so many difficulties reaching people. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=384.54s)]
*  And even the aid that gets to people is nowhere near enough. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=393.54s)]
*  You have seen pictures of people cramming around one bakery trying to get hold of a bag of bread. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=396.70000000000005s)]
*  Israel should not keep that loaf of bread from people any longer. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=404.70000000000005s)]
*  And in terms of your organization's experience, where are the specific blocks in terms of getting the aid into Gaza? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=408.70000000000005s)]
*  The approvals from the Israeli side, the murky nature of Israel's plans, is it going to allow us to? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=419.86s)]
*  I mean, there was promised to bring in more aid, which we haven't seen yet. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=427.86s)]
*  Approvals to bring aid, tons of aid that is waiting in Egypt or in Jordan, everywhere else. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=431.86s)]
*  At the same time, the long delays that we face whenever a truck crosses into Gaza, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=438.86s)]
*  it will have to go through another layer of security approvals on top of the inspections that take place. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=445.02000000000004s)]
*  Securing the route is another big issue. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=451.02000000000004s)]
*  And again, back to the looting incidents that we see and the criminal elements that are thriving on the way. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=454.02000000000004s)]
*  So it's a whole series, a whole chain of blocks. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=463.02000000000004s)]
*  And, you know, the blockade has been lifted in name only, I have to say. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=469.02000000000004s)]
*  So far, just over 100 trucks have made it into Gaza. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=474.18s)]
*  We're talking about probably 500, 600, 700, 1,000 trucks that we need to stave off the starvation [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=478.18s)]
*  that is rampaging over Gaza, particularly amongst children and babies. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=486.18s)]
*  Ahmed Bayram from the Norwegian Refugee Council Middle East, thank you for joining us on BBC News. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=494.18s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqnq9NH22jQ&t=501.18s)]
