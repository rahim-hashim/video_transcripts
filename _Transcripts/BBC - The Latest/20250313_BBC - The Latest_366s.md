Video Description: US President Donald Trump has threatened a 200% tariff on alcohol from EU countries unless a "nasty 50% tariff on whisky" is stopped.
 
It's the latest escalation of a global trade war, which this week has ramped up with 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminium entering the US.
 
The EU responded to the steel and aluminium tariffs by saying it would raise its levies on up to €26bn ($28bn; £22bn) worth of US goods, including boats, bourbon and motorbikes, from 1 April.

# US President Donald Trump threatens 200% tariff on alcohol from EU countries | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [March 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8)
*  The US President Donald Trump said on Thursday he would put a 200% wine tariff on all wines [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=0.0s)]
*  and other alcoholic products coming out of the European Union if the bloc did not remove [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=6.2s)]
*  its tariff on whisky. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=11.4s)]
*  The European Commission said on Wednesday that it will impose counter tariffs on 26 [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  billion euros worth of US goods from next month, ramping up the global trade war in [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=17.86s)]
*  response to blanket US tariffs on steel and aluminium. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=22.66s)]
*  My correspondent Tom Bateman is travelling with the US delegation to the G7 Foreign [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=27.08s)]
*  Ministers meeting and has the latest on the trade war developments. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=31.4s)]
*  Yeah, I mean maybe ironically the first session of the day is about strengthening the G7, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  this club of powerful nations of North America and Europe and Japan and yet they come into [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=40.76s)]
*  this particular meeting with as you say Donald Trump just having labelled the European Union [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=47.44s)]
*  which nearly half the members of the G7 are members of as hostile and abusive in terms [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=52.839999999999996s)]
*  of its economic practices and as you say threatening a 200% tariff on alcohol coming into the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=58.239999999999995s)]
*  United States. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=65.56s)]
*  So that might create a flurry of activity in the discussions around the table. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=66.56s)]
*  We're not going to be party to that because we're all close to the media but we had the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=70.75999999999999s)]
*  German and Italian foreign ministers come past us here a bit earlier. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=77.28s)]
*  That was before Donald Trump had put out that social media post so no response to that but [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=80.68s)]
*  I can imagine it will be perhaps part of the discussion. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=85.72s)]
*  The Canadian foreign minister says she's going to bring up tariffs in every meeting that [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=89.60000000000001s)]
*  they have today and tomorrow morning. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=93.56s)]
*  So what is Marco Rubio's response to that likely to be? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=96.72s)]
*  Well he's going to have to hold the line although as Donald Trump's chief diplomat I think he's [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=103.44s)]
*  here to try and sort of smooth off the corners of this extremely bumpy relationship now. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=108.2s)]
*  When we travelled with him on the way here he was asked about tariffs, he was asked about [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=116.52s)]
*  Mr Trump's labelling of Canada as the 51st state. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=120.24s)]
*  He added a caveat to that he said well it's the 51st state economically of course which [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=124.0s)]
*  I think gives you a sense of the sort of diplomacy he's trying to put around this but clearly [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=127.88s)]
*  there is a significant amount of tension between the hosts of this meeting and the Americans [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=133.72s)]
*  here. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=140.12s)]
*  I think Mr Rubio's instincts are going to be to try and de-escalate when it comes to [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=142.08s)]
*  that but it's obviously very hard to do when the boss is putting out messages that would [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=146.12s)]
*  be seen as even greater escalations and we've certainly seen a lot of back and forth when [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=151.8s)]
*  it comes to tariffs, some threats that Donald Trump has then not put in place but as you [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=158.0s)]
*  say significant tariffs on cross border trade between these two absolutely integral trading [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=164.28s)]
*  partners. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=169.76s)]
*  Tom Bateman there in Quebec, well in the last few minutes the US Treasury Secretary Scott [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=171.0s)]
*  Besant has been speaking to reporters about these tariffs, he said Donald Trump's initiative [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=174.96s)]
*  is aimed at protecting strategic industries and jobs in the United States, he had more [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=181.36s)]
*  to talk about incidentally on the possible government shutdown that he says he's weighing [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=186.06s)]
*  on economic sentiment right now, Senate Democrats not yet decided on whether to support the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=191.06s)]
*  continuing resolution from the House, the House of Representatives, that's certainly [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=198.3s)]
*  one to watch as we get closer to the end of the week. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=203.62s)]
*  But what about that threat of further tariffs from Donald Trump this morning, Adam Hirsch [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=206.54000000000002s)]
*  is the Senior Economist for the Economic Policy Institute in Washington. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=210.14000000000001s)]
*  Tariff threats can be and have been effective policy tools for industrial development when [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=215.74s)]
*  they're done in a targeted manner and strategically but this is not what Donald Trump is doing. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=220.94s)]
*  Look nothing that's happening in Washington right now is normal, if what's happening here [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=226.98000000000002s)]
*  was happening anywhere else in the world we'd call it a coup, the President is busy tearing [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=231.34s)]
*  down any and every institution that stands in the way of his consolidating power and [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=235.9s)]
*  these on again off again tariff threats are part of that, selling this economic chaos. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=240.86s)]
*  Yeah, as you suggest it is a daily whipsaw of announcements, tariffs put on, tariffs [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=246.06s)]
*  taken off, let me read you what he's just said in his social media post, the European [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=251.54s)]
*  Union is one of the most hostile and abusive taxing and tariffing authorities in the world, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=255.9s)]
*  it was formed for the sole purpose of taking advantage of the United States, they just [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=260.78s)]
*  put a nasty 50% tariff on whiskey, we will put a 100% tariff on all wines, champagne [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=266.22s)]
*  and alcoholic products coming out of France, it'll be great for the champagne business [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=272.78000000000003s)]
*  in the United States. Does he have a point that the EU puts too much tariff on US exports? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=277.98s)]
*  No I don't think so and certainly there are some trade issues that the United States has [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=287.26s)]
*  with the European Union but nothing that really raises to this level. What the President is doing [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=292.1s)]
*  is he's sowing uncertainty in the global economy because he wants business leaders and national [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=298.02000000000004s)]
*  leaders to come groveling at his feet but uncertainty is not what business leaders need to have for a [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=305.14000000000004s)]
*  robust economy, they need predictability in order to make decisions about investment, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=313.54s)]
*  in order to make decisions about hiring workers, Donald Trump wants to take that away and be at [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=319.06s)]
*  the center of that. Inflation numbers we got yesterday are backwards looking but looking [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=324.42s)]
*  forwards inflation expectations are rising while consumer confidence and business confidence is [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=328.82s)]
*  falling. Donald Trump is playing to the wrong political constituency, he's playing to his [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=334.58s)]
*  MAGA ideological base when he should be addressing the people who really put him in the White House [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=341.38s)]
*  working class voters who are concerned about the economy, who are concerned about inflation. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=347.38s)]
*  So far he's not given them anything to suggest that he's addressing their needs. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=352.1s)]
*  Adam Hirsch speaking to me just a short time ago, market's pretty flat at the moment in reaction [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=358.18s)]
*  to those later statements from Donald Trump. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y7Fohdpie8&t=363.14s)]
