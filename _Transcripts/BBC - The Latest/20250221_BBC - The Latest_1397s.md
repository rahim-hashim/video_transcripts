# Brooke Shields on how Hollywood views ageing actresses | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [February 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c)
*  I would be enamored with a guy carrying the big reflector. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=0.0s)]
*  And now I'm enamored with a guy holding the reflector [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  for very different reasons. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=7.32s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=8.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=9.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=9.56s)]
*  Right there. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=10.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=10.56s)]
*  A softer focus. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=11.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  Brooke, so many of the interviews I've read about you [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=12.780000000000001s)]
*  and watched about you kind of go straight [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=20.44s)]
*  to how at 11 months old you became a celebrity [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=22.88s)]
*  when you first appeared. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=25.88s)]
*  I was the original influencer. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=27.240000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=28.6s)]
*  In a soap ad. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=29.44s)]
*  And I wonder, looking back at that now, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=30.28s)]
*  to have so much focus on your childhood as an adult, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=32.36s)]
*  how does that feel? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=36.92s)]
*  I mean, in this day and age where everybody's hyper-focused [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=40.04s)]
*  on everything all the time, it seems par for the course [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=44.2s)]
*  a little bit. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=48.84s)]
*  But for it to have been the focal point for almost 60 years, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=49.8s)]
*  it's odd. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=55.72s)]
*  But it was a poignant time when that's how we made a living. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=56.84s)]
*  My dad wasn't waiting. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=63.92s)]
*  My mom didn't get alimony or anything like that. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=65.64s)]
*  And he was always going to pay for my education [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=68.44s)]
*  until I got older. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=72.0s)]
*  And then I did it. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=73.28s)]
*  But it was the idea that you're focusing on something. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=74.04s)]
*  I had no idea what I was doing at 11 months old. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=79.12s)]
*  I wasn't exactly ambitious then. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=81.84s)]
*  And it's an interesting trajectory, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=84.64s)]
*  because what if that hadn't happened? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=88.19999999999999s)]
*  What if I didn't get the ivory soap ad? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=92.72s)]
*  Or what if Jodie Foster didn't get the copper tone ad? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=94.8s)]
*  Or you kind of look back and you think, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=98.0s)]
*  I wonder, did that have anything to do with it? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  Or was it just happenstance? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=104.88s)]
*  And she kept it up. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=107.56s)]
*  I was able to work. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=109.52s)]
*  And we were able to pay our rent. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=111.16s)]
*  And do you look back and think there was kind of Brooke Shields, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=113.92s)]
*  the public Brooke Shields, through all of that period [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=117.0s)]
*  and through your teenage years, around whom [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=119.08s)]
*  there was kind of the movies and the maelstrom of controversy [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=121.92s)]
*  sometimes. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=125.6s)]
*  And then there was Brooke, who was the kid, Brooke Shields, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=126.24s)]
*  the teenager. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=130.24s)]
*  Were you able to ever be just Brooke Shields, the teenager? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=130.68s)]
*  Were there spaces you could find for that? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=133.24s)]
*  It was a theme that my mom really perpetuated. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=135.32s)]
*  And when I say that, she wouldn't [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=140.48s)]
*  let me go to professional children's schools. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=144.6s)]
*  I didn't get a high school equivalency test [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=147.6s)]
*  or certification that would allow me to just graduate [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=151.8s)]
*  from high school in a couple of months. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=154.96s)]
*  I went to regular schools in the city [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=158.16s)]
*  and then a high school in New Jersey. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=161.16s)]
*  And I think that all of those decisions [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=163.4s)]
*  that were made for me but then also made by me as I got older [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=168.44s)]
*  perpetuated me at the actual age. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=175.16s)]
*  Whenever we traveled, instead of being the only little kid [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=179.56s)]
*  in Japan, my mom would bring my stepsister or my best friend. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=184.44s)]
*  And so there was this little, we had this, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=189.36s)]
*  we can make fun of people and giggle and be kids [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=193.07999999999998s)]
*  and not feel like I was the only one that [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=197.08s)]
*  was a kid in a sea of uncaring adults. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=200.28s)]
*  You know, for all you, and it's been said of you before, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  Brooke, but for everything you went through so young [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=206.60000000000002s)]
*  and so consistently, the level, the degree [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=210.24s)]
*  to which you are so level-headed about life is remarkable. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=214.20000000000002s)]
*  I mean, it could have thrown, and there [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=217.24s)]
*  have been countless others who have been thrown off. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=219.24s)]
*  And yet somehow you've managed to retain [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=221.52s)]
*  a sense of calm in the storm, I suppose. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=224.44s)]
*  That topic has surprisingly come up a lot. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=231.8s)]
*  It was a perfect storm in a way. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=236.12s)]
*  I think there were many factors that contributed. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=238.56s)]
*  Living in New York, going to regular schools, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=241.64s)]
*  being raised by parents who had very strong standards [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=247.72s)]
*  for their own selves and their children. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=253.96s)]
*  And then there was a stubbornness in me [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=258.72s)]
*  that didn't want anybody else to win. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=262.72s)]
*  And so the negativity and the press and the vitriol [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=267.36s)]
*  and the attacks and the drugs and the alcohol [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=270.72s)]
*  and all these things, I wasn't going to let that win. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=275.72s)]
*  Because then I would have been a victim to something [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=280.92s)]
*  and that infuriated me. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=283.72s)]
*  And it did, even if I wasn't able to be articulate about it. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=286.32000000000005s)]
*  And then I started at a young age. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=290.48s)]
*  I mean, let's say high school, really. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=294.44000000000005s)]
*  I think I was doing my version of it younger. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=296.32000000000005s)]
*  But I really started to delve into psychology [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=298.16s)]
*  and why people act a certain way. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=304.08000000000004s)]
*  But the understanding of human behavior [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=306.08000000000004s)]
*  and what's reality and what isn't reality, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=309.16s)]
*  what you have control over, what you don't have control over, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=312.12s)]
*  was liberating to me. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=315.36s)]
*  So I thought, oh, I can be smarter than this. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=316.92s)]
*  I don't have to become an addict because I don't like the way [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=321.24s)]
*  it looks and it may or may not survive it. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=324.84000000000003s)]
*  Or I don't know, something in me just thought, oh, no. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=328.04s)]
*  What can I lose? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=333.56s)]
*  When I was reading about yours, that word control [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=335.6s)]
*  is interesting in the context of your life. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=338.48s)]
*  Because there are lots of moments, it seems to me, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=340.88s)]
*  where you have, even as a child, where you decided, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=343.24s)]
*  I'm going to control this situation to the degree that I can. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=346.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=349.8s)]
*  Whether it was your mother who was an alcoholic, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=351.8s)]
*  whether it was being on set. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=354.52s)]
*  Were you conscious of kind of thinking, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=358.12s)]
*  right, I need to be able to control something [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=359.92s)]
*  and this is how I'm going to do it? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=362.0s)]
*  I think I developed other things that fall [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=363.36s)]
*  into that category of survival. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=366.12s)]
*  I was very neat. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=371.24s)]
*  I was very organized. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=372.96s)]
*  I was borderline OCD because if something felt out of control, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=374.72s)]
*  I redid my file of facts or I refolded my sweaters. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=380.28000000000003s)]
*  And that's a function of being a child of an alcoholic as well, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=385.2s)]
*  one of the many. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=389.48s)]
*  But what's interesting about control [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=391.88s)]
*  is it can go either way. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=393.64s)]
*  You can say, I'm in control and therefore, nobody [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=397.47999999999996s)]
*  can tell me what to do. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=400.0s)]
*  It can flip to no one can tell me I can't drink drugs [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=401.52s)]
*  or no one can tell me I can't shave my head and go whatever. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=405.2s)]
*  There's different ways of doing it. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=410.71999999999997s)]
*  And so I always tried to look at the biggest view of a picture [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=412.56s)]
*  that I could and say, OK, what can I control? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=416.47999999999996s)]
*  And then as I got older, control became something less worrisome, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=420.84000000000003s)]
*  less toxic, less of a reaction. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=429.56s)]
*  And it became, oh, I can actually, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=432.12s)]
*  if there's something I don't like about myself, it's up to me. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=436.40000000000003s)]
*  I can control changing that. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=439.92s)]
*  Were film sets nice places for you as a kid? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=442.08000000000004s)]
*  Were they places where you felt in control? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=444.68s)]
*  I love them more than anything you can imagine. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=448.48s)]
*  You talk about control. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=451.56s)]
*  You get a call sheet. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=453.12s)]
*  You have times on the call sheet. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=455.32s)]
*  There's numbers and times and addresses. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=457.8s)]
*  I love the glee that is coming into your face. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=459.88s)]
*  And I have every single call sheet [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=461.92s)]
*  I've ever gotten from a pretty baby on. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=465.96s)]
*  And you know what to expect the next day. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=470.4s)]
*  You know what time you're going to eat lunch. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=474.08s)]
*  You know what the routine is. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=476.8s)]
*  There's something so comforting about that, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=478.6s)]
*  because you know what to expect. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=481.40000000000003s)]
*  And if you do your job well enough, they like you. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=483.84000000000003s)]
*  And they reward you for that. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=489.08000000000004s)]
*  And then you get another call sheet. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=491.84000000000003s)]
*  You get another call sheet. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=493.48s)]
*  Yeah, they don't kick you off. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=494.76s)]
*  And then there's inside jokes and games with tape. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=496.48s)]
*  And I used to have contests to see, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=502.24s)]
*  to prove that I could tear tape as fast as a gaffer. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=504.68s)]
*  And I could do the flip under. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=508.6s)]
*  And people marveled at it. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=510.32s)]
*  And that was when we used to actually have [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=513.32s)]
*  the clapper that was a chalkboard. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=516.52s)]
*  And I would get to do the clapboard. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=520.12s)]
*  And I had deep relationships with people. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=522.76s)]
*  Family? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=527.0s)]
*  Like family? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=527.96s)]
*  Absolutely like a family. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=528.92s)]
*  And it was so crushing each time we wrapped. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=530.08s)]
*  That was something that sometimes took me [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=534.28s)]
*  a week to get over. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=536.52s)]
*  Because you don't understand at a young age [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=538.48s)]
*  how you can be so close. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=540.72s)]
*  And then most of those people I never saw again. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=541.92s)]
*  But everything when you're on a movie set [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=545.68s)]
*  is why people think they fall in love a lot. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=548.56s)]
*  It's because it's common. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=552.0799999999999s)]
*  It's a common goal. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=553.3199999999999s)]
*  You all are working together as a team to make the day, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=554.9599999999999s)]
*  to get that. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=558.72s)]
*  And it's a beautiful interactive experience [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=560.88s)]
*  where everybody's job is important. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=565.16s)]
*  And I knew for four months I'd go to a new place. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=567.4399999999999s)]
*  For the most part, my mom was safe, which was a big deal. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=572.48s)]
*  Because she was either going to be at the hotel bar [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=577.48s)]
*  or at a pub in the neighborhood. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=580.4399999999999s)]
*  She still drank, but you knew she was safe. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=582.8s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=586.16s)]
*  That's what I was going to say. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=587.4s)]
*  She drank until the two minutes before she died. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=589.48s)]
*  I can see for you in that, with that, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=594.6s)]
*  living with that with your mother, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=597.52s)]
*  and then getting there and there's a call sheet. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=599.2s)]
*  That's just perfect. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=601.12s)]
*  For an alcoholic, for a child of an alcoholic? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=603.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=605.84s)]
*  That's an elixir. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=606.88s)]
*  That's just, and it's safety. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=608.44s)]
*  It's safety and it behooves them. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=611.5600000000001s)]
*  You don't know that they really only care about the money [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=614.6s)]
*  and getting their movie made or whatever. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=616.96s)]
*  But to an 11-year-old or 15-year-old, it's a respite. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=619.52s)]
*  And then they had to take care of her. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=624.0s)]
*  So they had to have a teamster on her that would drive her home. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=626.84s)]
*  So now she's not driving. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=630.5600000000001s)]
*  She can be hammered if she's not driving. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=632.72s)]
*  You're safe. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=634.9200000000001s)]
*  You're having a good time. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=636.0400000000001s)]
*  You get to maybe buy your apartment or a car. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=638.0s)]
*  So it was kind of a win-win. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=642.48s)]
*  The irony is that the movie sets were the sense of safety [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=645.72s)]
*  and normalcy, which is rare. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=650.8000000000001s)]
*  You described this sweet scene that you had. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=653.6800000000001s)]
*  Again, it feels to me like another control thing [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=656.44s)]
*  of separating yourself from the role, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=658.84s)]
*  where the camera would stop rolling and you would, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=661.1600000000001s)]
*  I don't know, I don't know what was it exactly, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=663.24s)]
*  or you would do that. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=665.44s)]
*  As a what? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=667.52s)]
*  I think, so I don't think I ever really looked [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=669.9200000000001s)]
*  at what I did as a craft. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=674.16s)]
*  I was never nurtured as an actress. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=676.64s)]
*  I wasn't, I didn't know that you could research or care [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=678.88s)]
*  or go deep or, I had to show up and stand in my light [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=683.68s)]
*  on a spot and say words that were given to me. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=690.08s)]
*  There was no kind of real connection. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=692.5600000000001s)]
*  And I think that I didn't feel totally adept at it, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=694.92s)]
*  very comfortable with it, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=700.4s)]
*  because I didn't have a place of real connection [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=702.4399999999999s)]
*  with any of my earlier roles. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=705.16s)]
*  And I think that it felt a little bit dangerous to me, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=707.5999999999999s)]
*  because if I got at all lost in any of those people, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=714.04s)]
*  which you can, there would be certain times [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=717.64s)]
*  when something would happen and maybe it was in a stunt [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=720.1999999999999s)]
*  and for one second, Brooke would get scared [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=723.0s)]
*  or I would be in a situation where I would be scared [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=726.48s)]
*  or I would get hurt or something. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=730.76s)]
*  And those moments were so terrifying to me [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=732.12s)]
*  because what if you don't get a call sheet for that? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=736.24s)]
*  What if my mom wasn't there? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=740.44s)]
*  What if something really did happen that was bad? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=742.52s)]
*  And what if they weren't really my friends? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=745.0400000000001s)]
*  Or like there's the weird thing that happens. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=748.08s)]
*  And so I thought, okay, you cannot let these characters [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=750.5600000000001s)]
*  or these roles or these people or any of this [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=756.1600000000001s)]
*  be your real life. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=759.04s)]
*  The minute it starts to be your real life, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=761.04s)]
*  well, newsflash, you become a better actress. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=763.28s)]
*  It's another story, but where does Brooke go? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=766.0s)]
*  Like I think that there was just like, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=770.92s)]
*  I didn't know if I was gonna be safe in it. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=772.44s)]
*  But if I could keep my sense of humor [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=776.68s)]
*  and be Brooke the clown, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=779.68s)]
*  then I could prove to the people watching, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=783.2s)]
*  like Cripps and Gaffers and Electricians and stuff [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=787.88s)]
*  that I had a real life. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=790.52s)]
*  You've written a book. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=792.92s)]
*  I have yet another one. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=794.32s)]
*  I didn't think I was gonna write another one. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=796.2s)]
*  Tell me about this one and I love the title. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=798.52s)]
*  Brooke Silt is not allowed to get old. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=802.16s)]
*  It's sort of a concept that we, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=805.16s)]
*  when I was younger, my mom and I would talk about, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=807.96s)]
*  those, the James Deans and the Marilyn Monroe's [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=811.64s)]
*  and the people that we did lose younger. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=814.92s)]
*  And we would talk about it. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=818.4799999999999s)]
*  And when you are not comparing myself to any of those people, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=819.3199999999999s)]
*  but when you are someone in the public eye [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=823.92s)]
*  and your persona or look or whatever is a focal point, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=826.1999999999999s)]
*  if that person dies looking like that person, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=831.88s)]
*  the one we knew and fell in love with, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=834.92s)]
*  that we imprinted on, they stay that person forever. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=837.12s)]
*  Unless you may be Audrey Hepburn, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=844.3199999999999s)]
*  who managed to really stay that person, I believe. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=845.48s)]
*  But if you are one of those people [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=849.72s)]
*  and you become imprinted on at a young age, a youthful face, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=853.24s)]
*  just regularly getting older [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=859.4s)]
*  is almost viewed as a disappointment. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=862.72s)]
*  I mean, Marilyn Monroe's a perfect example. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=865.04s)]
*  If I saw her as an 80 year old woman, I'd go, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=867.32s)]
*  oh, but she's in there somewhere. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=870.48s)]
*  Like I'd, you miss her. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=873.12s)]
*  You miss the one you fell in love with [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=876.44s)]
*  and looked up to and thought of or whatever it is. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=877.7600000000001s)]
*  And I see, so I think psychologically, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=881.6s)]
*  it's a very interesting thing. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=883.96s)]
*  But from a person who's that person, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=886.6400000000001s)]
*  you really have to do a lot of work on yourself internally [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=891.12s)]
*  to be okay with not also being disappointed with yourself. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=897.96s)]
*  Because you, I don't look, everything's lower and... [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=903.64s)]
*  And like, you know, and it was a shock to me [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=910.76s)]
*  the first time I saw Wrinkle on a monitor [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=914.8399999999999s)]
*  because I thought something was in the film. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=918.68s)]
*  I was like, he was like, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=921.64s)]
*  aw, they got a hair on the lens. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=922.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's gotta be a hair on the lens. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=925.0s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=926.4399999999999s)]
*  It's definitely, I believe a very American thing. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=927.28s)]
*  I think you go to Europe or, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=931.4399999999999s)]
*  or I'm not sure about the UK as much, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=933.64s)]
*  but definitely, definitely in Italy and France, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=937.8s)]
*  there is a certain respect and reverence [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=942.12s)]
*  for beauty, mature beauty. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=945.52s)]
*  We don't, we have not figured that out yet. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=948.76s)]
*  I think, I hope it's changing a bit. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=952.28s)]
*  And I think I'm hoping to contribute to that. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=954.64s)]
*  But it goes beyond youth obsessed. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=958.96s)]
*  You know, it's some... [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=963.16s)]
*  Is there, I mean, and I think particularly [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=965.12s)]
*  it is more for women and I've been thinking of it [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=967.48s)]
*  as I'm getting to 60, this idea that somehow you disappear. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=969.84s)]
*  I think aging is hard, but I think it might be, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=974.28s)]
*  I was wondering if it's even more complicated [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=976.88s)]
*  for somebody whose life has been defined [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=979.68s)]
*  by something they did when they were so young. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=982.52s)]
*  That is a definite contributor to all of it. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=985.9200000000001s)]
*  I think I got lucky in the fact that [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=990.96s)]
*  somewhere along the line, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=996.1600000000001s)]
*  and I think it started at university, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=997.8000000000001s)]
*  I knew that I had to find value beyond [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1001.84s)]
*  the surface in looks and beauty, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1006.84s)]
*  because it was so, such a part of my upbringing [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1008.96s)]
*  and who I was, you know, to people. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1013.2s)]
*  What you were known for. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1014.84s)]
*  Not myself, because I avoided looking in the mirror [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1017.36s)]
*  and I couldn't see what other people saw. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1020.5600000000001s)]
*  So therefore it was uncomfortable to me. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1023.24s)]
*  And I just didn't want to, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1025.24s)]
*  I didn't want to get to know that too much. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1027.52s)]
*  But I knew I needed to have other things. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1031.64s)]
*  So when you start to write books [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1034.4s)]
*  or take jobs in other mediums [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1037.64s)]
*  and learn different skills, Broadway, speaking, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1041.68s)]
*  all of those things that sort of add to you [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1046.92s)]
*  as a human being, the oneness [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1050.64s)]
*  I'm just looking a certain way, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1053.72s)]
*  or on the face of a decade, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1055.96s)]
*  which is ridiculous in and of itself. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1059.2s)]
*  And I was a pretty face, but you know, really? [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1061.64s)]
*  Like it's interesting to me, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1065.16s)]
*  but I nurtured other things always as a response [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1067.32s)]
*  to it not being just about beauty. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1073.0s)]
*  In writing the book, have you also, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1075.1599999999999s)]
*  or maybe just in the process of growing older, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1077.8s)]
*  and you and I have actually talked about this for the book, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1079.72s)]
*  are there upsides to being your age now [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1082.6399999999999s)]
*  compared to 10, 20, 30 years ago? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1087.1599999999999s)]
*  There's so many upsides. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1090.8s)]
*  And I think that there's a freedom to it. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1092.48s)]
*  And there's so many different factors [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1095.76s)]
*  that when you delve into them, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1098.76s)]
*  you understand why this is a prime of our life [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1101.24s)]
*  in a way that is focused on just us, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1106.24s)]
*  not our biological clock, not societal pressures, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1111.64s)]
*  not all of these things that we operate by [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1115.96s)]
*  because your time runs out. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1119.4s)]
*  And you've got to do this by that age, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1121.52s)]
*  you got to do that by that age. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1123.24s)]
*  So there's this like forward, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1125.12s)]
*  and then all of a sudden, your kids start leaving [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1128.08s)]
*  or your time starts looking different, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1130.44s)]
*  and you start to get to know yourself differently [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1134.12s)]
*  and actually like what you see and who you are. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1136.84s)]
*  You get to know why you're a good friend, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1140.28s)]
*  why you've been a good mother, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1143.8799999999999s)]
*  that you actually have talent. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1146.74s)]
*  I would have never said that in my younger days. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1150.6s)]
*  Like it's all these things and you sort of just, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1154.8s)]
*  you don't wake up and mind your sags and everything, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1157.6s)]
*  but you just kind of go, I mean, I got this far. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1160.8799999999999s)]
*  I healed from pretty crazy stuff. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1165.12s)]
*  I had humans in me and then feeding off of me. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1167.56s)]
*  It's like pretty cool if you think about it. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1174.8799999999999s)]
*  So there's something about, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1177.68s)]
*  I walked, I was in, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1181.8s)]
*  I was at a premiere the other night for Broadway [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1183.68s)]
*  and like everybody who was famous was there, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1186.72s)]
*  for Andrew Lloyd Webber, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1191.3600000000001s)]
*  it's around sitting next to behind Anna Wintour [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1192.68s)]
*  and everywhere you looked, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1196.92s)]
*  and there was like a famous person. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1199.04s)]
*  And that environment for me as a kid [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1201.3200000000002s)]
*  was just, if I could have brought my autograph book, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1205.48s)]
*  I would have. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1208.92s)]
*  And I was in awe, always. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1210.2s)]
*  And until like not too long ago, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1212.96s)]
*  because I always put myself sort of at the lower [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1217.32s)]
*  and looked up to them as successful because of their talent, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1224.3s)]
*  not longevity or lasting power, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1230.76s)]
*  which is what I always attributed to myself. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1233.8s)]
*  And I didn't even own my intellect. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1238.08s)]
*  Like I just, they were, you know, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1241.52s)]
*  That says the woman who went to Princeton. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1244.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's the crazy piece, right? [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1246.9199999999998s)]
*  And it wasn't until my later, later years, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1250.6s)]
*  and I walked around, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1253.84s)]
*  not with any type of arrogance or anything like that, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1256.2s)]
*  with a comfort and could walk up to people, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1260.22s)]
*  introduce myself or say hi, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1265.7s)]
*  knew most of them or had met them before. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1268.1000000000001s)]
*  And I went back and I sat down and I said to, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1272.5s)]
*  the friend who was with me, I said, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1275.6200000000001s)]
*  I think I finally understand all of this. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1277.98s)]
*  Everything that I've done and been and seen [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1282.3s)]
*  and grown from and learned gives me the opportunity [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1284.74s)]
*  to not be intimidated by any of these people in these rows. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1289.7s)]
*  I can admire them. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1294.22s)]
*  I can look up to them and love their talent. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1295.26s)]
*  I don't have to be, I've never been jealous. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1297.46s)]
*  I've been intimidated, scared that I'm not good enough. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1300.46s)]
*  That's not even envy. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1304.82s)]
*  It's like a different thing. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1306.4s)]
*  And I can be good enough. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1308.14s)]
*  I'm as good as whatever I used to hold up on a pedestal. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1310.98s)]
*  And you know, that took decades. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1315.38s)]
*  And that's just my trajectory, but... [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1318.3000000000002s)]
*  You don't feel like a fraud anymore. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrnDs4yYO5c&t=1321.98s)]
