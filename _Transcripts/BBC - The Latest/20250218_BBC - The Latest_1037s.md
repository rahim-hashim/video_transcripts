Video Description: Many will be delving into the world of Eora as Avowed is launched on Xbox and Xbox Game Pass - but back on Earth, the reality is that just 10% of gamers complete video games.
 
Speaking to BBC Newsbeat, Obsidian's game director Carrie Patel revealed how they've tried to make Avowed friendly for both seasoned RPG gamers and the casual, time-restricted players.
 
Carrie also revealed how Obsidian decided against making an MMORPG and what the future looks like for Obsidian under Microsoft's umbrella.

# Is Avowed a sign players are happy with shorter games? | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o)
*  I've definitely heard a sentiment on many of our teams and from our player base as well, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=0.0s)]
*  kind of the feeling of, oh good, like a game I can actually finish. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=4.48s)]
*  But I think that also really puts the onus on us as developers to make sure that the content [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=7.84s)]
*  we're making, the gameplay we're making, really is going to be worth the time players are putting into it. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=12.96s)]
*  We're just on the eve of the launch pretty much and then we'll be seeing some reviews soon. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=18.32s)]
*  How's everybody feeling at the studio? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=32.64s)]
*  We're very excited. You know, it's always a delight after you've worked on something for this many years [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=34.32s)]
*  to finally get to see it in players' hands. We're feeling really good about the buzz and the excitement [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=38.8s)]
*  that people are feeling. And one of the best things has been that as a team we've been playing [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=43.84s)]
*  the game a lot over the past several weeks. And so it's been a delight for all of us to discover [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=47.92s)]
*  and watch each other discover, you know, little secrets and levels we didn't know were there, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  get really invested in these builds and playthroughs and just have fun in the same [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=57.2s)]
*  way that we want our players to have fun with this game. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=60.72s)]
*  There was something that struck me from earlier interviews I've been reading that I wanted to just [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  pick your brains about. And I think it was Matt Hanson, who's the art director, said something [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=67.84s)]
*  quite interesting about Avowed being an RPG that respects players' time. And of course, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=72.88s)]
*  RPGs you tend to think of as being sort of massive 60, 100-hour epics. And the suggestion there was [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  that Avowed, if you want to, you can tackle reasonably quickly. I just wondered if you [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=85.36s)]
*  could talk me through what the thinking was behind that. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=89.52s)]
*  When we're building games, you know, we want all of our content to be placed very intentionally. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=91.6s)]
*  We're not trying to bloat with stuff just to keep players busy because we know everybody has [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=96.8s)]
*  plenty of options, plenty of things to do with their time. So we want everything that they find [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=102.32s)]
*  in our games to feel worth their time, to feel interesting, to pique their interest, and to drive [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=106.55999999999999s)]
*  their curiosity about the game world we're giving them. So scope-wise, players can expect something [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=111.83999999999999s)]
*  that's roughly on par with the outer worlds in Avowed. But the really neat thing about RPGs is [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=116.96s)]
*  you can really opt into the kind of experience you want based on the difficulty level you set, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=122.32s)]
*  based on how much or how little you engage with conversations, with exploration, with combat. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=127.84s)]
*  You can have a much longer, deeper, more expansive experience, or you can have a slightly quicker one. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=133.84s)]
*  And the game, the story you discover in the world, will really adapt based on what you [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=138.96s)]
*  personally find and what you personally do with those discoveries. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=143.92s)]
*  For a sort of long-time RPG development studio, if you're taking that approach, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=147.28s)]
*  is that quite hard to sort of manage both camps of players, you know, the people that might want [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=154.48s)]
*  that quicker playthrough, and then the kind of people that really like to get into every [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=159.6s)]
*  nook and cranny and really, you know, get the most out of the game? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=163.04s)]
*  I think it's an experience that we're used to optimizing for because RPGs have been our [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=166.56s)]
*  bread and butter for so many years. You know, we always want to make sure that the critical path, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=170.88s)]
*  that's the main story through the game, feels clear, gives them a strong sense of purpose, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=175.6s)]
*  kind of speaks to their existential motivations as a character in the world, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=180.8s)]
*  and that all of the side content that they can discover around that really forms that story, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=184.96s)]
*  builds out the world in interesting ways, gives them interesting ways to roleplay their character, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=191.04000000000002s)]
*  and gives them neat mechanical rewards too, like unique weapons, armor, other pieces of gear, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=196.32000000000002s)]
*  things that'll really make them feel more powerful in the world and give them more [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=202.08s)]
*  options for how they want to play. So, you know, we always have to understand kind of [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=205.28s)]
*  what's the basic experience going to be of someone who's only doing that main story? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=209.68s)]
*  Are they going to know exactly what they need to know about the world and what's driving them [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=214.32s)]
*  forward? Are we making sure that they're going to get maybe just enough experience to continue [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=217.92000000000002s)]
*  forward, but then, you know, making sure that players who dip into those other parts of the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=221.6s)]
*  world who, you know, really want to clear all of the map, that they're finding things that are new [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=227.04000000000002s)]
*  and novel and not rehashes of, you know, content that we've already placed elsewhere. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=231.84s)]
*  Is that kind of approach something you've found you've had to do more during your time as Obsidian? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=236.4s)]
*  Because I think there's a sense, isn't there, that a lot of gamers who might have been playing [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=240.96s)]
*  games for many years, they're getting a bit older, they've got more commitments, and just balancing [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  games around your own life can sometimes be quite difficult. Is that something that you [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=250.88s)]
*  have found yourselves taking into account more, sort of as the longer you've been with Obsidian? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=254.96s)]
*  Yeah, there's, I've definitely heard a sentiment, you know, on many of our teams and from our player [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=260.08s)]
*  base as well, you know, kind of the feeling of, oh, good, like a game I can actually finish, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=265.28s)]
*  a game I can get all the way through. You know, you're right, like one of the neat things about [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=270.47999999999996s)]
*  gaming expanding as a market, and I think so many more people coming to games, so many people who [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=275.52s)]
*  grew up with games, you know, still playing them, you know, is that there's such a broad range of [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=280.23999999999995s)]
*  interests, but I think that also really puts the onus on us as developers to make sure that [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=286.08s)]
*  the content we're making, the gameplay we're making, really is going to be worth the time [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=291.2s)]
*  players are putting into it. Again, I don't think most people are looking for something just to, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=295.92s)]
*  you know, kill a few hours, like they, you know, we all have options, and so players want things [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=300.56s)]
*  that are going to reward their curiosity, that are going to show them something that feels new and [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=306.24s)]
*  novel, and they're going to give them a really immersive, a really immersive valuable experience. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=309.84s)]
*  And another thing I think we're hearing more about, you've got that group of players that [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=315.36s)]
*  maybe that bit older, maybe they now have families or demanding jobs, and then the other end of the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=321.04s)]
*  scale, we hear a lot that another challenge, particularly if trying to grow an audience is [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=325.68s)]
*  maybe you have younger players that are sort of fairly stuck to a particular live service title, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=330.48s)]
*  for example. Is that another consideration when you have offering people this kind of [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=335.68s)]
*  mixed approach of how they can play the game in terms of the length of time they spend with it? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=342.8s)]
*  Over the years, I've heard, you know, various concerns and handwringing at different times [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=346.88s)]
*  about, oh, are single player games done? Does everybody, you know, just want to play these, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=351.84s)]
*  you know, live service games? Does everyone just want to play multiplayer now? But I think there's [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=356.08s)]
*  always, there always has been, and I think there always will be a market for single player games, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=361.04s)]
*  for games that give you, you know, a really cohesive singular experience, and then allow [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=364.96s)]
*  you to move on to the next one. There's a stat that often gets trotted out in these conversations [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=370.8s)]
*  about how something like only 10% of people ever finish games. And I mean, as someone who [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=375.2s)]
*  plays games, I find that depressing. How does that feel when you read that as someone on your end of [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=380.15999999999997s)]
*  the equation? You know, I remember it was both surprising and kind of not when I first came across [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=384.96s)]
*  that. It's kind of liberating in a way once you embrace that fact, though, because again, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=390.88s)]
*  especially in an RPG where you were building so much content that is opt-in and so much content [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=395.76s)]
*  that is designed to be discovered by people who are looking for it and missed by those who are [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=400.56s)]
*  not, it really lets you lean into building the content for the people who are going to find it. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=406.24s)]
*  So something like companion conversations. These are, you know, moments where you're having kind of [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=411.6s)]
*  those deep, long kind of character arc building conversations with the main characters who are [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=416.48s)]
*  going to follow your player character throughout the course of the game. We're writing those for [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=421.44s)]
*  the people who are going to have them and for the people who enjoy them, because most of them are [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=426.08s)]
*  ultimately optional. So, you know, whenever you're writing a quest or a conversation or putting [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=429.84s)]
*  together a combat, there's always this little voice in the back of your head that says, but what [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=435.67999999999995s)]
*  about for the players who are going to skip this? And so you always want to make sure that you have [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=438.88s)]
*  those exit ramps for people who are less interested in getting into the weeds of the lore, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=443.35999999999996s)]
*  less interested in finding every mini boss in the map. But what that means is you're saying, okay, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=449.67999999999995s)]
*  here is an optional combat with a really tough mini boss. Here is a really deep but really [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=455.04s)]
*  character rich conversation with this companion that the players can be spending their time with. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=461.36s)]
*  I can invest in this combat for the people who want it and this conversation for the people who [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=466.0s)]
*  really want to have it, because I know that the people who don't, whether that's 90%, 50%, whatever, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=470.88s)]
*  they're just going to stay away from it. But I can make sure that the people who are going to look [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=478.08000000000004s)]
*  for it, who are going to engage with it, are going to have the best possible time with it. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=481.6s)]
*  And I suppose whenever you put any kind of creative work out into the world, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=485.04s)]
*  you just got to accept that everyone's going to, yeah, do their thing with it. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=488.0s)]
*  Yeah, especially with games for sure. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=492.16s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's many different approaches people take, certainly. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=495.28000000000003s)]
*  And just looping back to, yeah, you were talking about this idea that single player games, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=500.64000000000004s)]
*  I mean, it feels like every few years people pronounce the death of single player games, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=506.64000000000004s)]
*  but then hearing you talk about the kind of process behind the Pseudonym games about there, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=510.8s)]
*  and it sounds like there's a studio with a real strong culture of this kind of [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=518.48s)]
*  world building and it's very much rooted in single player games. And it sounds like you've [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=522.72s)]
*  really stuck to your guns with Avald in terms of keeping that focus on providing a single player [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=527.12s)]
*  experience. And was that something you were quite insistent on as a studio? Because I think [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=535.28s)]
*  you get the sense that there's sometimes a pool to follow trends or things like that. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=542.0s)]
*  I mean, and there's been some talk about this already. We've discussed this in the past, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=547.52s)]
*  very, very early in Avald's development and pre-production, there were efforts to make it [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=552.4s)]
*  multiplayer. But what we realized relatively quickly was that kind of the features and [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=557.36s)]
*  experiences that we needed to build for multiplayer were in competition with the [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=563.12s)]
*  features and experiences that make our single player games compelling. And so things like, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=568.96s)]
*  how do you have a multiplayer experience with character dialogue? Do you have one player [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=574.32s)]
*  driving and everybody else is spectating, which is kind of the opposite experience of what we're [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=579.6s)]
*  trying to get when we put together these branching dialogue trees? How do we handle having multiple [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=584.24s)]
*  players in the world at once, moving certain quest states forward and changing the world around [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=590.08s)]
*  it? And I realize that these are challenges that larger multiplayer games that have been around for [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=595.84s)]
*  a very long time have solved, but they are very real challenges, both technically and creatively. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=601.9200000000001s)]
*  And so for us, we feel that our strengths really lie in creating that strong immersive world, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=608.0s)]
*  a really compelling single player experience, a really tight narrative that gives the player a [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=614.72s)]
*  media role in the world and characters who get to know, and to explore the conflicts and the [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=620.48s)]
*  challenges that they're coming across in the world. And all of that is something that we can convey [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=626.56s)]
*  much more clearly and specifically in a single player game. Yeah. And do you, do you just feeling, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=631.12s)]
*  I guess the fact that we've ended up with Avald, right, is probably answers this, but [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=637.52s)]
*  the, is the feeling that it would have been a mistake to go down the multiplayer path? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=641.2s)]
*  I think there's been a few cases recently where studios have sort of moved out of their [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=646.72s)]
*  area of expertise, perhaps particularly single player studios, and then it's maybe not quite [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=652.24s)]
*  gone as well as it could have done. Do you feel like it would have been a mistake for Obsidian [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=656.88s)]
*  to pursue a multiplayer path or? So, you know, every, every, making every game is about trade-offs [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=663.28s)]
*  and deciding where you're going to invest your time, which creative and technical problems [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=669.36s)]
*  you're going to solve and which you're going to say maybe another day. You know, as a studio, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=673.2s)]
*  we have made Grounded, which is multiplayer. You know, and studios like Larian have made fantastic [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=677.76s)]
*  RPGs that have very strong single player experiences as well as multiplayer components. I think that [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=683.6800000000001s)]
*  for Avald, single player was the right choice. I think it allowed us to lean into our strengths [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=689.84s)]
*  and it allowed us to focus our creative and technical problem solving on creating a really [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=694.72s)]
*  strong world, a very nuanced narrative, some really great companion characters, and also building a [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=699.9200000000001s)]
*  really beautiful and technically performant world that I think is going to really stand out for [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=707.36s)]
*  players in a few days. Being under Microsoft, did that kind of help with that goal of sticking to [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=711.12s)]
*  the single player path? Did that give you a bit of security there? I think being part of Microsoft [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=716.64s)]
*  has just given us more security in making our games generally. They've been a wonderful partner [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=723.76s)]
*  to us. They've been very supportive of all the games we've made from, you know, Avald coming out [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=729.12s)]
*  in a few days, Outer Worlds 2 coming out later this year, to even smaller games like Pentament, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=734.96s)]
*  you know, that have a very specific vision and a very specific audience. So, you know, having that [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=740.0s)]
*  support, having them, you know, understand and really champion our vision for these games has [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=744.4s)]
*  been wonderful. And we've also gotten some great technical support as well. You know, they have [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=750.08s)]
*  groups like the Advanced Technology Group and support at the Coalition, which has really helped [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=756.4000000000001s)]
*  us optimize our levels, basically get the whole game running as smoothly as it possibly can. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=762.4000000000001s)]
*  And they have a wonderful user research department that also gave us some fantastic testing [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=769.0400000000001s)]
*  of our first few hours of the game that let us iteratively improve that experience so that [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=773.76s)]
*  every tutorialization was clear for the player, the player could understand the world they were [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=779.28s)]
*  in a little bit faster and a little bit better and just understand how to play the game in a [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=783.8399999999999s)]
*  pretty seamless and natural way. Speaking of Microsoft, you're going to hate me. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=788.8s)]
*  There's the question that is often asked about Avald, whether we'll see it under the console soon. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=794.56s)]
*  I kind of feel like you're probably not going to answer that. And Phil Spencer's made his [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=800.0799999999999s)]
*  views on that pretty clear. But just look into the future for Obsidian. I wondered, do you [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=805.04s)]
*  envisage a kind of multi-format future? And do you feel as if the days of platform exclusivity [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=811.5999999999999s)]
*  might be sort of coming to an end, as the narrative seems to be? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=820.88s)]
*  So I don't really have a whole lot of insight into the long-term business decisions there. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=826.48s)]
*  Outer Worlds 2 is going to be a multi-platform game. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=832.32s)]
*  Personally, as a developer and a gamer, I'm just excited for however we can get our games [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=836.1600000000001s)]
*  into more players' hands. Well met, that one. Not the first time you've been asked it, though, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=840.4000000000001s)]
*  I'm sure. And just as well, obviously, there was a lot of attention on Microsoft last year [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=845.0400000000001s)]
*  and various things going on with mergers and studios and things like that. And are Obsidian [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=853.2s)]
*  feeling pretty optimistic about the future and the Microsoft as things stand? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=859.28s)]
*  I mean, we're releasing two games this year. We're feeling fantastic. Yeah, as a studio, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=864.24s)]
*  I think we've gotten a very good rhythm and practice around having multiple projects in [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=870.3199999999999s)]
*  flight at once. We find it to be both pretty creatively fulfilling and it also ensures that [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=875.04s)]
*  we've always got something to move our teams on to, always got something new we're working on. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=881.76s)]
*  We've always got something that one team can learn from another on. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=885.84s)]
*  So yeah, we're feeling good about the future. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=889.36s)]
*  That's good to hear. That's good to hear. And we've not got too long left. Just, how are you [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=891.6s)]
*  feeling about releasing the game in February? Because it's a busy old month, isn't it? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=898.88s)]
*  You know, I don't know that there are that many months anymore that aren't busy. It feels like [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=903.9200000000001s)]
*  there's something big coming out every month of the year these days. But I'm really excited by [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=907.84s)]
*  the way I've seen people responding to a vote already. It's been extremely heartening to see [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=914.24s)]
*  that every time we've done some kind of early hands-on preview or play through, the people who [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=918.64s)]
*  have played the game come away loving it and saying they want to play more. So I feel really [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=923.6s)]
*  great about players getting their hands on the game themselves soon. And yeah, I think we're [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=929.44s)]
*  going to stand out. Cool. And final question really on that point, I guess, and is there a [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=935.6800000000001s)]
*  particular element or just anything that you're looking forward to the public getting hands on [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=942.08s)]
*  and experiencing with a vote? One of the most interesting things about a vote, in my opinion, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=948.8000000000001s)]
*  is how explorable the world is. There are a lot of little secrets and hidden moments in the world, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=954.4000000000001s)]
*  in conversation trees. There's so much about the world that you can discover if you follow [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=962.48s)]
*  your curiosity and kind of poke around in the nooks and crannies we've left. And so many things [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=968.24s)]
*  that the team has done a wonderful job of creating is these sort of little visual set pieces that [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=973.44s)]
*  tell a story all of their own. So one of my favorite things is to see players start to [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=978.64s)]
*  discover these things for themselves when they play through the game, to see what sorts of theories [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=983.44s)]
*  they formulate, to see just that sense of reward and delight at having found something that [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=988.72s)]
*  you kind of discovered was there and then wondering how big the rest of the world is [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=994.88s)]
*  and what else there is for you to find. Awesome. Sounds good. Well, yeah, I look forward to checking [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=998.96s)]
*  that out a bit more, as many other people are, I'm sure. That was great. That was everything for me, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=1004.24s)]
*  Carrie. I don't know if there's anything you thought we missed or if you wanted to add anything [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=1008.88s)]
*  quickly at the end there. I'm excited to see what kinds of envoys players build, what kinds of story [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=1012.08s)]
*  choices they make on February 18th. Awesome. Well, we'll be looking out for a vote then. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=1017.04s)]
*  Great stuff. Thanks ever so much for your time. It's been really interesting speaking to you and [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=1023.28s)]
*  yeah, best of luck with the launch. Hope it all goes well. Thank you so much. It was great to talk to you. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBpN7jx9W_o&t=1028.16s)]
