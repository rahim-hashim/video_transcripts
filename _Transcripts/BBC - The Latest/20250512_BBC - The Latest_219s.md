Video Description: Hamas says it will release Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander, who is believed to be the last living captive with US nationality in Gaza, as part of efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement.
 
The decision comes ahead of President Donald Trump's visit to Qatar on Tuesday for negotiations.
 
Hamas said it was also intended to facilitate a deal for the entry of humanitarian aid - Gaza has been under an Israeli blockade for 70 days.
 
The Israeli PM's office said it had not committed to any ceasefire but only to a "safe corridor" for Mr Alexander's release.

**BBC - The Latest:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg)
*  Hamas says it will release an Israeli-American hostage, Eden Alexander, as part of efforts [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=0.0s)]
*  to reach a ceasefire deal in Gaza and allow humanitarian aid into the territory. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=6.1000000000000005s)]
*  The announcement follows direct talks between the group and the US administration in Qatar. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=11.540000000000001s)]
*  President Trump said on social media that he was grateful to those involved in the release, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=16.9s)]
*  including the mediators Qatar and Egypt. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=21.1s)]
*  Israel is refusing Hamas' demands for a ceasefire in exchange for the remaining 59 Israeli [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=24.34s)]
*  hostages, many of whom are already dead. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=29.62s)]
*  Mr Trump is due to visit the Middle East this week. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=32.86s)]
*  Well, let's cross over to speak to our Middle East correspondent, Yolande Nel, who joins [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=35.38s)]
*  us from Jerusalem. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=38.620000000000005s)]
*  So, Yolande, what do we know about this potential release of Eden Alexander? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=39.620000000000005s)]
*  Well, we've had no formal announcement of when this 21-year-old who was serving as an [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=44.78s)]
*  Israeli soldier on the 7th of October, 2023, when he was captured in those Hamas-led attacks, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=52.58s)]
*  we don't know exactly when he'll be released, but Israeli media are suggesting it could [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=59.94s)]
*  be as soon as noon local time. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=64.86s)]
*  That's 10 o'clock London time. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=67.74s)]
*  We're expecting that Hamas and mediators would meet once again this morning to finalize the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=70.25999999999999s)]
*  details of this release. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=77.9s)]
*  The family of Eden Alexander, they've been prominent campaigners among the hostage families, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=80.16s)]
*  are said to be flying from the US to Israel. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=85.7s)]
*  They've called this the greatest gift imaginable. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=88.94000000000001s)]
*  This comes after just one month ago, there had been a number of videos put out by Hamas [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=93.06s)]
*  showing their son alive, and then we had Hamas saying in a statement that the group that [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=99.58000000000001s)]
*  was holding him had lost contact with their handlers. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=105.44s)]
*  That really raised question marks after an Israeli strike reportedly, whether Eden Alexander [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=112.02000000000001s)]
*  was still alive. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=117.86s)]
*  It also comes, of course, after we've had a sort of downgrading of expectations ahead [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=119.94s)]
*  of President Trump's Middle East visit, despite the fact that it's his first major foreign [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=125.02s)]
*  trip of his second term. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=130.38s)]
*  That has really been because of the impasse that there has been over efforts to secure [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=133.06s)]
*  a new Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal, with Hamas saying they're only ready to give [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=140.06s)]
*  up the remaining captives they're holding. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=144.54s)]
*  Hamas thought up to 24 could still be alive in exchange for a kind of comprehensive deal [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=146.46s)]
*  that would pave the way to the end of the war. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=152.34s)]
*  Meanwhile, we've had the Israeli government, the Israeli prime minister, really sticking [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=154.94s)]
*  to this idea that there must be a complete defeat over Hamas in Gaza and that it's only [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=160.26000000000002s)]
*  military pressure that will bring back Israeli hostages. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=167.22s)]
*  So there is now some increased positivity that there could be further steps. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=171.98s)]
*  We've had the Israeli prime minister's office, though, saying in statements this morning [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=176.7s)]
*  that all that it has given in exchange for Eden Alexander's perspective release is this [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=180.42s)]
*  promise of a safe corridor during the handover. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=187.01999999999998s)]
*  And so really stressing that there have not been any concessions at this stage. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=191.62s)]
*  Yolande, as always, many thanks for your analysis. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=195.7s)]
*  Yolande Nel, they're joining us live from Jerusalem. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=197.98s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=200.7s)]
*  And just a line coming from the AFP news agency, which is quoting a source close to Hamas [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=201.7s)]
*  saying that a US Israeli hostage to be released most likely Monday or Tuesday. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=206.38s)]
*  So we are just, of course, continuing to monitor that and we'll get the very latest from Yolande [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=213.38s)]
*  as and when we get any more details. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7JLFow1sfg&t=217.82s)]
