Video Description: SpaceX has launched a rocket carrying a new crew to the International Space Station (ISS) as part of a plan to bring astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams home.
 
The pair were due to be on the ISS for only eight days, but because of technical issues with the experimental spacecraft they came on, they have been there for more than nine months.
 
The astronauts are due to begin their journey back to Earth two days after the new crew arrives.

**BBC - The Latest:** [March 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOdDlfO97dA)
*  A SpaceX rocket has blasted off carrying a replacement crew to the International Space Station, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOdDlfO97dA&t=0.0s)]
*  which paves the way for NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunny Williams to come home. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOdDlfO97dA&t=5.0s)]
*  The pair have been on the space station since June, when their original eight-day trip was extended to more than nine months after problems with their spacecraft. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOdDlfO97dA&t=10.0s)]
*  Our science editor Rebecca Morell has the story. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOdDlfO97dA&t=19.0s)]
*  Heading to the International Space Station, on board four astronauts at the start of their journey. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOdDlfO97dA&t=30.0s)]
*  But their departure also marks the beginning of the end for another mission that's grabbed the world's attention. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOdDlfO97dA&t=35.0s)]
*  NASA astronauts Sunny Williams and Butch Wilmore have now been on the space station for more than nine months. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOdDlfO97dA&t=41.0s)]
*  They were only supposed to be there for a few days. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOdDlfO97dA&t=48.0s)]
*  Now the arrival of the replacement crew means that they can finally head home. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOdDlfO97dA&t=50.0s)]
*  We came up prepared to stay long even though we planned to stay short. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOdDlfO97dA&t=55.0s)]
*  That's what we do in human spaceflight. That's what your nation's human spaceflight program is all about. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOdDlfO97dA&t=59.0s)]
*  Planning for unknown, unexpected contingencies. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOdDlfO97dA&t=63.0s)]
*  This might be my last flight. That's a little sad. I'm trying not to think about it too much. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOdDlfO97dA&t=66.0s)]
*  Being in space is just pretty spectacular. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOdDlfO97dA&t=72.0s)]
*  Butch and Sunny's mission began in June on a test flight of a new Boeing spacecraft. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOdDlfO97dA&t=76.0s)]
*  But after technical problems, NASA decided the capsule was too risky to bring them home, so it came back without them. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOdDlfO97dA&t=81.0s)]
*  Touchdown. Starliner is back on Earth. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOdDlfO97dA&t=88.0s)]
*  NASA opted for the next planned SpaceX flight to bring them home instead, but its return journey was always set for now. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOdDlfO97dA&t=92.0s)]
*  The NASA pair have taken their extended stay in their stride, but a fellow astronaut and friend says it's the simplest of things that they'll be looking forward to. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOdDlfO97dA&t=99.0s)]
*  You miss the basic things about life here on Earth. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOdDlfO97dA&t=108.0s)]
*  I had an email from Sunny just the other day where she talked about missing sitting on the porch in her house in Maine with the dogs and smelling the fresh air, feeling the sun on your face. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOdDlfO97dA&t=111.0s)]
*  All those things are things you long for, and that's normal. I had that same kind of feeling when I came back from my long duration mission. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOdDlfO97dA&t=121.0s)]
*  It won't be long for the pair now. A last look at these spectacular views and after a few days of handing over to the replacement crew, Butch and Sunny can start their journey back to Earth. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOdDlfO97dA&t=128.0s)]
