# US sends military assets to the Middle East as Israel-Iran conflict escalates | BBC News
**BBC - The Latest:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo)
*  You're gambling with World War III. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=0.0s)]
*  This is breaking our security. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=5.0s)]
*  We need to expand. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=8.0s)]
*  As a military strategic plan, a former plan, you don't want politicians telegraphing what your next moves are going to be. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=9.0s)]
*  The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=16.0s)]
*  A peacekeeping force does not exist with a ceasefire. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=21.0s)]
*  Hello, this is the Security Brief here on BBC News. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=31.0s)]
*  And in the programme, the conflict between Israel and Iran continues to escalate with air raid sirens blaring across cities inside both countries. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=35.0s)]
*  President Donald Trump calls for residents in Tehran to evacuate. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=45.0s)]
*  The United States is also sending its military might to the Middle East with a second aircraft carrier on its way to the Arabian Sea along with five destroyers. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=51.0s)]
*  But what stage of the conflict do we find ourselves in? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=64.0s)]
*  That's the question. And where might it all be heading? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=68.0s)]
*  With me to discuss as ever is former senior officer and assault helicopter pilot in the British military, Mikey Kay. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=71.0s)]
*  And as always, Mikey will deliver his brief as he would to his generals. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=78.0s)]
*  The big question, I guess everyone is asking, where does this conflict go next? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=84.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's some significant developments today in terms of tracking very large movements of US air assets, particularly the what's called a KC-135. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=89.0s)]
*  Let's go slide. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=99.0s)]
*  This is a KC-135. It's a tanker aircraft, so it's used to refuel fast jets, for example, heading onto a target. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=101.0s)]
*  You can see on the back or you could see on the back as it was taxing out, there's the big boom on the back, which is used to plug into into the jets. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=109.0s)]
*  Now, what's what's significant about this is, is that these aircraft are trackable and are likely refueling US strike aircraft such as the F-35 fifth generation fighter, the F-15 and possibly the F-22 Raptor, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=117.0s)]
*  which is probably one of the most advanced air defense fighters in the world, which belongs to the US. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=129.0s)]
*  These won't be trackable, but by deduction, the tankers are airborne. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=134.0s)]
*  It's likely there is forward deployment of US strike aircraft being positioned into or near the Middle East. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=138.0s)]
*  So I'm certainly at the moment watching for movement of these fighters across locations such as RAF Lakenheath, which is a US base in England or Ramstein in Germany. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=145.0s)]
*  There's a US base that I was deployed to for six months in Aviano in Italy, which is about two hours north of Venice, and then RAF Akateri in Cyprus as well. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=156.0s)]
*  There's also movement of another US aircraft carrier towards the region, the USS Nimitz. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=165.0s)]
*  Let's take a look at the USS limits. The USS Nimitz was located in the South China Sea, but is now tracking westwards, citing operational commitments. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=170.0s)]
*  And the Nimitz will join the USS Carl Vinson that has been on operations in the Red Sea, striking Houthi targets in Yemen. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=180.0s)]
*  So lots of American military movement. We can see that. What do you think is the US strategy behind all of that? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=186.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, if I was to sort of pick two major reasons, it's for sure absolutely sending a message to Iran that the US is is putting massive capability into the region as a show of overwhelming force. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=193.0s)]
*  Usually it would be an aircraft carrier. That's a real power projection. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=207.0s)]
*  But the fact that they're going to have two aircraft carriers in the region, as well as major land based strike assets, aircraft, this is significant. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=211.0s)]
*  And I think it's a method of attempted coercion to get Iran to the negotiating table. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=220.0s)]
*  But you may ask how successful is that going at the moment? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=226.0s)]
*  Well, Iran have already pulled out of the negotiations which were approaching their fifth or sixth round, I believe. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=230.0s)]
*  So, you know, it's a it's a big gamble. And whether it will work or not, whether it will deescalate or not and bring people to the table, I think is the big question that's up for grabs. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=236.0s)]
*  Last question, Mikey, I guess it's a broader one. It's where is all this going? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=243.0s)]
*  There's a lot of rhetoric about Israel wanting regime change in Iran. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=248.0s)]
*  Donald Trump may be getting America more directly involved with those bunker busting bombs that you mentioned. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=253.0s)]
*  Where is where is this heading, do you think? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=259.0s)]
*  Yeah, we often talk on this program about courses of action. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=262.0s)]
*  That's a military strategic planning term for options that are worked out by military teams that build out what what a potential course of action could be. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=266.0s)]
*  And there could be numbers of them, you know, a most likely course of action or a most dangerous course of action. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=276.0s)]
*  These could range from cutting the head off the snake, for example, going directly after the Ayatollah. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=281.0s)]
*  You know, Trump, for example, posted on truth social. We can go slide and look at some look at his post. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=286.0s)]
*  He said, we know exactly where the so-called supreme leader is hiding. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=291.0s)]
*  He is an easy target, but is safe there. We are not going to take him out brackets kill. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=295.0s)]
*  That's a message in terms of what one of the potential courses of action might be. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=300.0s)]
*  But then you spoke about regime change, right? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=304.0s)]
*  That's a bigger operation to try to affect regime change. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=306.0s)]
*  Now, this is really important. And having had direct experience in Iraq over this, this is a very dangerous strategy that has proved catastrophic in the past. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=309.0s)]
*  Let's take Iraq, for example, served on three tours. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=319.0s)]
*  Know that know the operation very well right from its inception in 2003 all the way to to flying operations over Baghdad in 2008. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=322.0s)]
*  And this is really important. If you take out a regime like they did with Saddam, you take out the security apparatus. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=331.0s)]
*  And if that security apparatus isn't filled with a military force or a police force, you then get a security vacuum, which is exactly what we saw. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=337.0s)]
*  The consequence of this in Iraq was Al Qaeda in Iraq, Al-Sarqawi's terrorist outfit. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=345.0s)]
*  They were allowed to thrive. They then morphed into Islamic State in Iraq, which then morphed into Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=352.0s)]
*  And excuse me. And the whole thing, the whole security vacuum just was a complete disaster. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=361.0s)]
*  You then have Iranian backed militias, the Popular Mobilization Forces. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=367.0s)]
*  They were allowed to thrive. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=371.0s)]
*  So, you know, the big thing for me is is Iraq. Iran is around four times the size of Iraq. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=373.0s)]
*  And you pursue a strategy of regime change and there's rhetoric coming out of the US on it already. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=378.0s)]
*  You create a way bigger problem than you ever did in Iraq. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=383.0s)]
*  And I think, you know, we really need to look at history and how well that went in order to sort of sit up and really, really focus on whether you want to do this, because I would absolutely advise no. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YDTOWIQSo&t=386.0s)]
