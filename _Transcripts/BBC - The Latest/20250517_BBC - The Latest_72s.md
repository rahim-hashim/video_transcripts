# 'I usually go to Eurovision every year, but not this year'. #BBCNews
**BBC - The Latest:** [May 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F-Sh2yCXqI)
*  I'm a serial Eurovision tourist but this year I'm not going. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F-Sh2yCXqI&t=0.0s)]
*  A few years ago I met my boyfriend and he's the biggest Eurovision fan I've ever met. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F-Sh2yCXqI&t=2.64s)]
*  Over the past few years we've actually started going, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F-Sh2yCXqI&t=6.16s)]
*  so I think that's been really nice to share that experience with him. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F-Sh2yCXqI&t=8.24s)]
*  So this year I think the calls for a boycott are a lot more established. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F-Sh2yCXqI&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  We know kind of what a Eurovision looks like with Israel competing under these circumstances. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F-Sh2yCXqI&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  One of the other things is this year the artists have actually been banned [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F-Sh2yCXqI&t=21.92s)]
*  from displaying any flag that isn't from their own country. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F-Sh2yCXqI&t=25.04s)]
*  So last year the winner was non-binary and displayed the non-binary flag. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F-Sh2yCXqI&t=27.68s)]
*  It was a really celebratory moment whereas this year that's just not allowed. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F-Sh2yCXqI&t=32.16s)]
*  So I think one of the other things that's kind of a barrier to people going this year [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F-Sh2yCXqI&t=35.36s)]
*  is the fact that it's being hosted in one of the most expensive countries in the world. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F-Sh2yCXqI&t=39.04s)]
*  One of the big parts of Eurovision is going out and partying, being in the fan village [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F-Sh2yCXqI&t=42.96s)]
*  and doing that this year would be so expensive that it's going to be prohibited for a lot of fans. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F-Sh2yCXqI&t=46.96s)]
*  you [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F-Sh2yCXqI&t=57.68s)]
