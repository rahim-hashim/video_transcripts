**BBC - The Latest:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFkjAVVqpdo)
*  Where my land is, there's a mine that's trying to destroy my country. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFkjAVVqpdo&t=0.0s)]
*  14 years I've been trying to stop that mine. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFkjAVVqpdo&t=3.68s)]
*  If I had given up way back when, our family may have been different. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFkjAVVqpdo&t=6.08s)]
*  Adrian has taken the Queensland government to court four times over energy company Adani's coal mine, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFkjAVVqpdo&t=9.76s)]
*  which he says threatens the sacred Dung Mabila Springs. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFkjAVVqpdo&t=14.72s)]
*  They've bankrupted me because of the mining company. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFkjAVVqpdo&t=17.68s)]
*  Adani decided to walk in on the cases and then say that I have to pay all their costs. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFkjAVVqpdo&t=19.84s)]
*  You can't have a business, you can't run a house, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFkjAVVqpdo&t=25.2s)]
*  they can't take anything off me because they didn't have anything in the first place. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFkjAVVqpdo&t=27.92s)]
*  I'm an Aboriginal mate. All we had is land and country. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFkjAVVqpdo&t=31.12s)]
*  This is where we belong and we're expressing our connection to land, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFkjAVVqpdo&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  environment, nature and water. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFkjAVVqpdo&t=39.36s)]
*  But the miners split the rest of the Wangan and Yagalingu people, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFkjAVVqpdo&t=42.56s)]
*  the majority of whom voted to sign a deal with Adani after the state government said [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFkjAVVqpdo&t=45.6s)]
*  it would take the land anyway when negotiations broke down. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFkjAVVqpdo&t=49.44s)]
*  We got out of it what we could, but then again, if we hadn't agreed, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFkjAVVqpdo&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  it just went ahead. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFkjAVVqpdo&t=58.24s)]
*  Adrian is going back to court. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFkjAVVqpdo&t=60.72s)]
*  If successful, the case would be the first of its kind in Australia. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFkjAVVqpdo&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  This is not about stopping coal mining, it's about our human rights, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFkjAVVqpdo&t=66.4s)]
*  that the government cannot ignore our human rights any further. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFkjAVVqpdo&t=70.56s)]
*  The Australian government relies on coal for jobs, domestic energy and exports. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFkjAVVqpdo&t=74.16s)]
*  Adani told the BBC that the springs are not at risk from any of the mining they are doing [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFkjAVVqpdo&t=78.32000000000001s)]
*  now or in the future. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFkjAVVqpdo&t=82.32000000000001s)]
*  The Queensland government says it is committed to protecting the cultural [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFkjAVVqpdo&t=83.52000000000001s)]
*  and environmental values of the springs. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFkjAVVqpdo&t=86.56s)]
