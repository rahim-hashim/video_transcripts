Little has been heard from the PA leadership ‚Äì also the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the internationally recognized representative of the Palestinian people ‚Äì throughout Israel‚Äôs ongoing genocide on the Palestinian people in Gaza, and its silence has been noted far and wide.

# The Palestinian Authority: A policy of national suicide, with Abdaljawad Omar
**The Electronic Intifada:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw)
*  Welcome back to the Electronic Interfer the podcast. I am Omar Kermi [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=0.0s)]
*  Associate Editor at EDI and your host for today. I will be joined by Abdul Jawad Omar a [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=5.32s)]
*  lecturer and PhD candidate at Berset University where he currently teaches in the Department of Philosophy and Cultural Studies [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=11.96s)]
*  Today we'll be discussing all things Palestinian Authority in a week where PA leader Mahmoud Abbas [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=20.28s)]
*  has formally appointed Hussein Sheikh, the Secretary General of the Palestine Liberation Organization as his PLO deputy [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=26.0s)]
*  effectively anointing him, heir apparent [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=33.44s)]
*  But heir to what? Given that Bizzal El Smotrich, Israel's finance minister, has declared 2025 the year of sovereignty [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=37.92s)]
*  presumably Israel's over the West Bank, what is there to inherit and why would you want it? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=45.92s)]
*  In a recent article I wrote for the Electronic Interfer the I wrote about the PA's leadership's waning legitimacy and relevance [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=51.66s)]
*  a legacy of the 1993 Oslo Accords that [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=59.58s)]
*  whether by effect or design has rendered the PA [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=62.78s)]
*  which was in the 1990s presented as an institutional precursor to statehood [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=66.3s)]
*  largely an adjunct of Israel's military occupation [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=71.06s)]
*  As for this reason that a leaked document purporting to be from the PA's General Intelligence Service presenting a list of measures [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=74.77999999999999s)]
*  Palestinian security forces would take if in charge of Gaza and the day after [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=81.17999999999999s)]
*  Seemed so believable to so many [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=87.17999999999999s)]
*  The listed measures in that document [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=91.33999999999999s)]
*  included gathering information about Hamas with a view to completely dismantling the movement and [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=94.25999999999999s)]
*  In return for Israel agreeing a quote change of course and quote in the West Bank [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=99.22s)]
*  Such measures the documents unknown unknown author writes unnecessary to salvage what remains of the PA's legitimacy [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=106.14s)]
*  There are doubts of course about the veracity or source of the document which may well be a fake [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=113.66s)]
*  But that the document was widely shared online suggests that even if many may have harbored doubts its content seemed believable [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=119.42s)]
*  The fact that many thought it plausible that such a list of measures was being circulated [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=127.26s)]
*  Even as Palestinians in Gaza continue to suffer Israel's genocidal aggression is a measure of the depth to which the PA [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=131.94s)]
*  Or at least its senior leadership has sunk in the public's estimation and it raises serious questions about [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=140.5s)]
*  What the future holds for the PA for its leadership or Palestinian diplomacy in general as well as for West Bank Gaza relations [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=147.7s)]
*  Joining us to talk about all of this is up to do an armada a lecture and PhD candidate is a university [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=154.86s)]
*  Abdul Jawad is a regular contributor to the electronic into father Munda Weiss and other publications as well [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=161.46s)]
*  The regular guest on the Millennials on I'm sorry the Millennials are killing capitalism podcast [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=168.5s)]
*  His most recent article from under wise [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=176.46s)]
*  Detailed a rather unsavory spectacle of a new shopping mall being open to much fanfare in Ramallah [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=178.46s)]
*  Even as two million Palestinians are facing starvation in Gaza [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=184.78s)]
*  I've just a word welcome [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=189.26000000000002s)]
*  Thanks, I'm glad thank you for joining us today [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=191.98000000000002s)]
*  Sorry for the lengthy introduction [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=195.58s)]
*  No, well, yeah, yeah [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=197.9s)]
*  Perhaps let's start with that article [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=200.54000000000002s)]
*  It was from 18th of April entitled [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=202.54000000000002s)]
*  Palestinian elites through a huge party at the opening of a mega mall [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=205.58s)]
*  First what made you write to this article and what does this party throw show about Ramallah in general? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=210.78s)]
*  And what you call the Palestinian elites in [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=217.1s)]
*  specifically [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=220.94s)]
*  Well, I mean [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=223.18s)]
*  I'll be honest the choice for Palestinian elites and [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=225.18s)]
*  You know the title of the article was not mine [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=229.34s)]
*  You know the title of the article was not mine [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=232.14s)]
*  But more [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=237.1s)]
*  More broadly and perhaps even [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=239.01999999999998s)]
*  In in many ways, I think [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=241.98s)]
*  You know the mall itself being named icon, which is you know, it's not a name that just labels [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=244.14s)]
*  But you know also consecrates and it seeks in many ways to inscribe itself [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=250.38s)]
*  into something [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=256.53999999999996s)]
*  Quite sacred if you want, you know an icon is something to be perhaps followed emulated [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=258.14s)]
*  Along those lines. So there's that [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=265.09999999999997s)]
*  interplay in language where [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=267.97999999999996s)]
*  this new [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=270.46s)]
*  Mall being opened up is also [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=271.97999999999996s)]
*  a sign of [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=275.02s)]
*  the way the palestinian middle class that is teethered to [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=277.02s)]
*  the palestinian bureaucracy the pa [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=281.18s)]
*  or those who [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=284.38s)]
*  Currently extract much of the capital within the palestinian economy [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=285.98s)]
*  Including you know people from within the political leadership or what is called mistakenly a political leadership [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=291.1s)]
*  Also people who are head of security services [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=297.90000000000003s)]
*  people who have [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=300.94s)]
*  invested [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=302.3s)]
*  a quite a lot in [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=303.74s)]
*  You know businesses and capital extraction and service monopolies within the palestinian authority [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=306.14000000000004s)]
*  You know have created this, you know [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=312.38s)]
*  Disneyland of consumerism [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=314.54s)]
*  within ramallah [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=317.42s)]
*  It's not necessarily anything [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=319.02s)]
*  uh quite extraordinary when compared to amman for instance or [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=321.02s)]
*  New york for that matter, you know, you know for me as I write also in the article. I don't think there's anything really [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=325.42s)]
*  New in this except that it [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=333.98s)]
*  You know arrives generally in palestine malls [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=336.46s)]
*  other consumers [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=339.65999999999997s)]
*  A bit later than other places, you know that are much more connected to this kind of globalized economy [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=342.38s)]
*  but I think uh the fact that this mall was opened and [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=349.5s)]
*  with fanfare as as you said with [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=353.82s)]
*  a sense of shamelessness [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=357.1s)]
*  around [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=359.18s)]
*  uh, you know the spectacle the other horrific spectacle of [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=360.38s)]
*  Viewing with you know, this kind of synit desynetized or sanitized. I'm sorry [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=364.94s)]
*  Uh, you know a gaze [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=370.46s)]
*  The daily massacres in gaza. I think tells us something more broadly about the current political condition [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=373.26s)]
*  Within the west bank itself and I don't think this is necessarily only a affliction among [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=381.26s)]
*  Let's say specific class or it although it concentrates itself in this [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=387.42s)]
*  You know what the article says, it's the palestinian elite [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=391.74s)]
*  But it's simply something that is more [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=395.1s)]
*  Pervasive pervasive among palestinians more broadly which is not denial which kind of connotes that you [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=397.96000000000004s)]
*  Denied that something is going on so you don't acknowledge that it's going on but actually a form of this avowal [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=405.18s)]
*  Which means that you realize that there is a massacre and a genocide and that you live within the domain of this [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=411.5s)]
*  State that actually is committing these horrific crimes [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=417.42s)]
*  But still you insist on maintaining business as usual [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=421.42s)]
*  and this yeah, and this operation has a political if you want implication because [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=426.46s)]
*  It actually supports [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=432.14s)]
*  The maintenance of the palestinian authority itself [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=434.38s)]
*  Through also a political operation that is going on where this avowal meets, you know holding the palestinian authority or not holding [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=437.65999999999997s)]
*  This avowal meets or encounters a political and psychological [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=447.41999999999996s)]
*  War that has been launched since uh tufan al-aqsa or october 7th [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=452.4s)]
*  Which is trying to actually place the responsibility for everything that is happening on the shoulders [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=458.0s)]
*  Of the fighters and the resistance fighters themselves and we saw actually, you know abu maz in in his meeting with his [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=463.84s)]
*  You know a national council call the resistance fighters and those who [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=471.59999999999997s)]
*  Belong to resistance more broadly as ulaad al-khalifa [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=477.35999999999996s)]
*  Which means, you know, yeah, yeah, so we'll get back to that point in a second. Um, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=480.08s)]
*  But what I want wondered actually, I mean life goes on of course [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=486.4s)]
*  And it wouldn't be surprising to see people elsewhere opening malls and celebrating but [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=492.4s)]
*  Doesn't this speak to sort of a very deep division? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=498.64s)]
*  between [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=503.68s)]
*  the west bank and gaza [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=504.71999999999997s)]
*  Between the west bank and gaza [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=507.12s)]
*  I mean, it's been you know, the gaza has been under blockade for 17 18 years, of course beforehand [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=510.0s)]
*  And it seems to me that if palestinians themselves [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=518.64s)]
*  Are willing to pretend that life can go on as normal in the west bank [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=522.72s)]
*  That that's that's quite a serious sort of [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=527.52s)]
*  Alienation if you like between the two, uh populations. What do you think? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=531.1800000000001s)]
*  No, for sure. I mean, this is one of the you know, uh truths that have been revealed with tufan al-aqsa [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=536.8000000000001s)]
*  I think you know what has been going on [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=542.0s)]
*  in terms of israel actually [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=545.36s)]
*  Dissecting the palestinians into these kind of six geographies if we want [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=547.74s)]
*  Some people claim perhaps seven which is palestinian citizens of israel [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=552.64s)]
*  Palestinians in the west bank palestinians in jerusalem palestinians in gaza palestinians in chatat but also palestinians in prison for instance and palestinians [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=556.48s)]
*  who [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=564.1600000000001s)]
*  Uh are in the graveyard, you know if you want to talk about these various geographies and what they mean [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=565.04s)]
*  uh [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=570.8s)]
*  So the dead imprisoned and these dissections of life across these different borders [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=571.68s)]
*  And one of the things that happened [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=576.48s)]
*  from the outset of tufan al-aqsa [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=578.7199999999999s)]
*  is that when the head of [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=581.68s)]
*  uh al qassam brigades hamad el-deif actually [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=584.0799999999999s)]
*  uh, you know, uh, you know [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=587.52s)]
*  Announced that this operation is going on he called on the people of the region but also on the palestinian people to [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=590.16s)]
*  To join in the struggle which is part of the palestinian resistance [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=597.4399999999999s)]
*  you know, um [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=600.8s)]
*  Let's say a tradition which you know is embodied in this idea of nidat in arabic which means a call a call to summons [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=602.16s)]
*  To come on the streets, etc [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=610.48s)]
*  And from that moment, you know, uh the decision taking in gaza was [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=612.72s)]
*  You know out of sync if you want with the rest of the geographies [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=617.68s)]
*  Now, I don't think this is this is where the danger comes becomes, you know, uh, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=622.0799999999999s)]
*  Politically at least there's something dangerous in saying that [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=626.9599999999999s)]
*  Because generally most people would go it's you know, it's you know, the west bank people are problematic. It's not about [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=630.3199999999999s)]
*  People it's not about a whole society. We cannot condemn society as such [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=637.76s)]
*  We need to see what is actually working within this society why the society does not have political organizations [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=642.16s)]
*  So then the idea of for instance, you know israel's [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=649.3599999999999s)]
*  You know, uh counter insurgency campaign, which is always ongoing in the west bank that exhausts any, uh [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=653.76s)]
*  Uh exhausts the ability of palestinians to actually come up with if you want political organizations [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=660.0s)]
*  Is is one of the elements of why there was no sinking because people do not act out of only spontaneous action specifically when this [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=666.1s)]
*  october 7th was such a [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=673.3s)]
*  Big if you want event that people could not actually, uh, you know [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=675.22s)]
*  subsume within their whole symbolic and political [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=680.66s)]
*  Uh, uh, you know fabric if you want so the problem, uh from the outset was that there's this out of sinking [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=684.42s)]
*  But with the ongoing massacres [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=692.02s)]
*  With the fear that people live under [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=695.9399999999999s)]
*  With the idea that the west bank is next with the intensification of violence with the prisons that have become horrific slaughterhouses [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=698.74s)]
*  even for palestinians who are arrested within the west bank [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=707.7s)]
*  This is all added up and compounded up to create a moment of uh, you know choking [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=711.22s)]
*  So there's something that calls me to act but at the same time [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=717.7s)]
*  I'm incapable of acting so I I end up choking incapable of actually really mustering or creating any words or or grammar or [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=721.38s)]
*  Um, you know meeting the demands of this moment in any significant way [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=729.78s)]
*  And so there's that element of it sounds like you're suggesting [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=733.94s)]
*  There is a lack of leadership a lack of people who can focus that energy [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=737.38s)]
*  Of course. Yeah, I mean that's one of the elements. I mean it's a it's it's a persistent campaign omar of actually [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=742.26s)]
*  Depriving the palestinian [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=749.3s)]
*  palestinians of any alternative leadership [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=751.36s)]
*  Uh the west bank than the one that we actually [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=753.7s)]
*  Uh have to bear [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=757.0600000000001s)]
*  in the palestinian authority itself and those around let me get back to that because um [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=758.82s)]
*  We have a clip I think of the speech you mentioned before [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=765.38s)]
*  Uh, mahmoud abbas, I believe this was at the plo but which is supposed to be for [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=769.62s)]
*  Well all factions except hamas islamic jihad and a few others but um [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=774.66s)]
*  But it ended up being mostly [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=780.4200000000001s)]
*  I believe fatah that is abbas's faction [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=783.3000000000001s)]
*  um [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=786.58s)]
*  abbas's movement, um [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=787.62s)]
*  Because I think the pflp and the democratic initiative and others refuse to actually attend that particular speech [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=790.02s)]
*  I don't know if we can show this clip [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=797.22s)]
*  Israelia [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=804.1s)]
*  What um what you make of that [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=830.6600000000001s)]
*  Well, I mean, uh [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=834.1s)]
*  one kind of tragic comic if you want thing about [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=835.62s)]
*  The comments is that you know part of actually the plo [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=839.5400000000001s)]
*  Culture of uh, you know, um [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=844.26s)]
*  Called, you know organizational culture was actually the use of profane language [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=848.5s)]
*  and I think this is perhaps the only thing that remains from [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=853.62s)]
*  the 70s and 80s [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=857.62s)]
*  When the plo was actually [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=859.86s)]
*  Uh revolutionary fedai [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=862.5s)]
*  Strugglers who you know that they used profane language with uh, quite liberty and we see that embodied in abbas himself [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=864.66s)]
*  Who was part of that generation at least? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=871.78s)]
*  Uh still being used but now turned against those who are resisting [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=874.1s)]
*  The second thing is that it's quite naive [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=878.02s)]
*  Uh, it tells us that um, you know mahmoud abbas who? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=881.22s)]
*  Who you know [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=886.1s)]
*  have this [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=887.78s)]
*  Uh have invented this concept of pragmatic realism if you want within the palestinian leadership [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=889.06s)]
*  is actually [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=895.38s)]
*  only [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=896.66s)]
*  In you know, not pragmatic or realistic. I mean that's one of the problems is that [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=897.9399999999999s)]
*  You know when you have prime minister nitinian for instance saying that even if they handed in all [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=902.7399999999999s)]
*  Uh, the captives that the resistance has in gaza that they will still go on occupy gaza [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=907.8599999999999s)]
*  Ethnically cleanse it and turn it as trump wants into a revier and in fact [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=914.0200000000001s)]
*  One of the things that is holding israel back and perhaps creating a lot of internal contradictions also within israeli society [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=919.7s)]
*  Is the persistence of this captive problem that is [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=925.86s)]
*  Uh, you know one of at least the cards of leverage that the palestinian resistance have to end [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=928.74s)]
*  The genocidal war that is going on [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=933.62s)]
*  So that showed a lack of realistic assessment. It shows [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=935.94s)]
*  no, uh sense of pragmatism but also [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=940.1s)]
*  Uh, unfortunately this you know, uh use of profane language in ways [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=943.62s)]
*  Um that kind of echo the only echo from the 70s and 80s. Unfortunately. Yeah. Well, well, let's start with that [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=948.5s)]
*  I mean, I think uh, there's been an interesting almost sort of an experiment political experiment happening here where [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=954.58s)]
*  You've got this movement fatah and the plo more broadly [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=962.02s)]
*  Which was promised statehood and sort of climbed a few steps [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=966.5s)]
*  Up that which is what is represented effectively by the palestinian authority [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=971.7800000000001s)]
*  And it was promised statehood by the basically the west [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=976.98s)]
*  the us in particular, of course, uh, and the eu and others and uh in the 1990s it was presented as a [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=981.22s)]
*  sort of institutional precursor to a state [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=989.86s)]
*  But it never got there [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=993.94s)]
*  And so it kind of has adopted the institutionals the language the [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=995.46s)]
*  the uh supposedly [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1001.86s)]
*  Realistic realism, uh that that these are the only steps it can take it has to continue on this path [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1004.96s)]
*  However, those countries who promised statehood are the same countries who have backed [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1012.6600000000001s)]
*  Is rose genocide in gaza [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1017.3000000000001s)]
*  And so what is the thinking with continuing to rely on these countries to deliver you [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1019.22s)]
*  When they have shown quite clearly that they have no red lines when it comes to israel or so it seems anyway [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1024.82s)]
*  Well, the sorry thing omad, I don't think that they care about the deliverance [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1031.14s)]
*  Anymore, I mean, I think that's not really within the horizon of thinking within the palestinian leadership [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1035.94s)]
*  I think they talk the talk of palestinian state but simply [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1044.02s)]
*  They see themselves as people who govern [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1048.1799999999998s)]
*  um, you know remnants ruins [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1052.02s)]
*  And [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1056.7399999999998s)]
*  You know doing it in a way that actually benefits them benefits, uh their pockets [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1057.78s)]
*  Um, but they they they're not struggling for anything. I mean that was I think one of the ideological [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1063.3799999999999s)]
*  tools used [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1070.1799999999998s)]
*  After the second intifada to entice the palestinian population more broadly [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1071.6999999999998s)]
*  Towards accepting and buying in into this fayad's program of state building and institution building [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1076.5s)]
*  In the hope of achieving a state and I think by 2012, um, you know, um, you know [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1084.02s)]
*  It started around 2006 7 by 2012, you know that that narrative [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1090.26s)]
*  started to erode slowly because you know as you said, you know [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1096.26s)]
*  Every but every international financial institution actually at that moment declared that palestine is ready for statehood [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1100.6599999999999s)]
*  every every political actor in the world, not political actor, but any risks, you know, um [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1107.9399999999998s)]
*  Neutral organization also claimed that the eu world bank [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1114.74s)]
*  imf [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1118.74s)]
*  Uh un all of them said we're ready for statehood [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1120.02s)]
*  But the statehood didn't arrive and you know [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1122.9799999999998s)]
*  At that moment you start to have like the slow if you want the decomposition of this whole narrative [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1125.5400000000002s)]
*  and the reinvention of the palestinian authority from one that actually [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1132.5s)]
*  uh [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1138.1000000000001s)]
*  Seeks some sort of future horizon [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1139.14s)]
*  which is the realization of some sort of state to some to a [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1142.26s)]
*  To a body that only manages what it can get and and I think that at this particular moment [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1148.42s)]
*  They're using the genocidal [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1155.14s)]
*  violence in gaza the intensification of violence and fear here to present themselves as the only [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1157.7s)]
*  way for survival through cooperation through collaboration with israel [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1165.38s)]
*  and [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1170.02s)]
*  by doing so, um [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1171.3000000000002s)]
*  They're becoming [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1173.3000000000002s)]
*  more and more shameless [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1174.9s)]
*  in in the sense of any pretensions of still holding any nationalist ethos and we can see that even in terms of [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1177.38s)]
*  How this meeting the abbas was speaking in? [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1184.74s)]
*  Uh, you know announced uh [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1188.18s)]
*  appointment of a vice [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1190.88s)]
*  uh president and and a vice [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1193.7s)]
*  Uh chair of the plo [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1196.98s)]
*  That's right. Yes. I mean, uh, i'm saying the sheikh, uh, you know, he has gone through the sort of standard [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1200.26s)]
*  proving [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1207.44s)]
*  Uh of any palestinian leader politician [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1208.5800000000002s)]
*  Been to you know, he's been in prison for a long time. Uh, uh, he was very active in fatah during the first inter-father [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1212.76s)]
*  What but but surely even they I mean I I look at the opinion polls, uh, uh, you know [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1222.12s)]
*  Taking them for what opinion polls are worth and and you can see you can see that. Um [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1230.68s)]
*  Um the on you know how unpopular the leadership has become [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1237.32s)]
*  very clearly, I mean this is this is [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1242.12s)]
*  So the latest opinion poll this is from the uh palestinian center for policy and survey research [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1244.76s)]
*  um [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1250.6s)]
*  Uh, they usually do quarterly, uh polls, but the last one they did was in september 24 [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1251.72s)]
*  Um, but you can see you can see even from the year, you know the year leading up to september 24 [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1258.12s)]
*  I mean this is not [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1265.96s)]
*  You know in any normal, uh, uh, well in any [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1268.28s)]
*  normal context [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1272.04s)]
*  Uh a leader that is that unpopular that for a year [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1273.56s)]
*  Uh, basically 80 up to 90 want them to resign there would have to be a reaction to this [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1279.08s)]
*  Um, and it's not just him. It's it's um [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1286.84s)]
*  It's it well, it's it's him. It's very specifically him actually because if you look at uh, someone like marwan barhuti [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1291.08s)]
*  Who for better or for worse? [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1298.84s)]
*  Uh has consistently polled as as the most popular palestinian politician [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1300.84s)]
*  But who is of course in prison and has been since I think 2003 [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1306.36s)]
*  um [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1311.32s)]
*  You can see that that [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1313.08s)]
*  He is still and remains [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1315.1599999999999s)]
*  uh the most popular, um [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1318.1999999999998s)]
*  Uh palestinian politician if if he were to run he would win an election even against habas and against [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1321.48s)]
*  Uh any hamas candidate, but again we can see if you if you look at the gray part [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1329.16s)]
*  This is abbas's share of that vote. So the yellow part is is is will not participate [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1333.72s)]
*  but again [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1340.04s)]
*  This is this is fatas standing at the moment and uh, and this is a straight runoff [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1342.6000000000001s)]
*  uh between uh fata and uh a hamas candidate again the people who won't participate or not again, but this time [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1349.24s)]
*  Uh, that's a majority of of people according to the polls, but again [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1358.2s)]
*  Fata and abbas are [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1364.52s)]
*  Lagging far far behind [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1367.08s)]
*  Of course the last elections we held and not presidential elections where hamas didn't put up a candidate [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1369.48s)]
*  But last parliamentary elections we held [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1375.08s)]
*  Um hamas won [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1377.72s)]
*  Right, and I think that's the last slide. Is there a last slide? [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1379.8s)]
*  Um [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1383.16s)]
*  This is [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1387.48s)]
*  To to really illustrate the point this is without abbas and if that's a nominated marwan barhuti [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1389.0800000000002s)]
*  He would largely be [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1395.72s)]
*  A winner a fairly clear winner, but a winner so it strikes me that [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1400.04s)]
*  Were it put to the vote were it put to any sort of popular? Uh, uh will [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1406.8400000000001s)]
*  A fatas is shooting itself in the foot here. Does that matter to them? [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1412.44s)]
*  Uh, I don't think it matters no, I don't think it matters as much as people make it out to be because I think that [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1418.84s)]
*  They understand their power is [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1425.8s)]
*  Quite completely contingent now on on israel's backing on their ability to lubricate [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1428.84s)]
*  uh [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1435.56s)]
*  Halcyon pocket specifically parts of the middle class through the control of bureaucracy and [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1436.68s)]
*  While popularity might be something that would serve their project [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1443.8s)]
*  um of you know [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1449.0800000000002s)]
*  Endurance in the future, etc. I think that actually they're quite [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1452.3400000000001s)]
*  You know comfortable even being an object of [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1458.6000000000001s)]
*  people's uh anger or dislike [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1463.3200000000002s)]
*  At some level I wouldn't say on a personal level they they like that they they are an object of hate [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1466.76s)]
*  but I think that as long as they can still um control the extraction of [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1472.68s)]
*  Finances from the palestinian economy [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1479.3s)]
*  Uh still have some sort of symbolic power within palestinian society [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1481.48s)]
*  You know the idea of popularity does not strike them as the most important element in their uh struggle for survival [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1485.3200000000002s)]
*  Uh, they survive by you know wielding israel's baton in front of our faces [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1491.72s)]
*  That's the that's the basic idea by being able [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1497.08s)]
*  To still have enough power within palestinian society to recruit new [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1500.04s)]
*  police officers, uh create a new generation that you know rises, uh, uh, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1504.28s)]
*  in terms of class within uh palestinian authority ranks [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1510.28s)]
*  So there's like a socioeconomic operation a symbolic operation a financial extraction operation [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1514.2s)]
*  But at the same time as long as israel is in the background capable of conflicting violence [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1519.88s)]
*  you know, uh people look at them as a [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1526.52s)]
*  source of some sort of certainty and stability and daily routine [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1530.2s)]
*  so [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1534.68s)]
*  And then I think and just to add to that um, sometimes [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1535.8s)]
*  even that operation of hate allows us [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1539.88s)]
*  Allows palestinians in the west bank to not feel complicit with the regime that controls us [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1543.72s)]
*  Interesting. Yeah, you know, you know like on some psychic level [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1550.2s)]
*  This is i'm just saying on psychic level that you know, it's it's quite you know, yeah, we hate [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1553.32s)]
*  Abbas or he's unpopular etc [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1558.52s)]
*  But that as long as it doesn't become or arise on the street as an actual politics of contestation [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1561.72s)]
*  You know, it becomes just this kind of passive acceptance of reality as such [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1569.8s)]
*  This is a problem with the dynamic between society and pa at this current moment [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1574.28s)]
*  At least for now, I mean it could change. Um, but yeah [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1579.48s)]
*  We'll get back to that but it strikes me as it's kind of like a noose a titan itself, isn't it? [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1583.96s)]
*  Yeah, because the the more the israelis, uh, uh, uh titan the security situation in in the west bank the more [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1588.84s)]
*  checkpoints the more settlements [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1596.98s)]
*  a the more and and the more the pa continues its security coordination, which [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1599.56s)]
*  consistently is the main [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1605.86s)]
*  Problem that the palestinians say they have the people say they have with the pa [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1608.26s)]
*  The more necessary it becomes [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1613.9399999999998s)]
*  Because the more unpopular you are the less control you have the more you need to rely on your security, uh forces [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1616.34s)]
*  And with that funding coming mostly from the u.s and the eu [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1622.34s)]
*  The more beholden you are to these international actors who have shown that [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1628.1s)]
*  Even with a genocide they will still continue to support israel. So there is [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1633.78s)]
*  Logically there seems to be no no no outcome [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1638.72s)]
*  At least any of the stated outcomes of the pa claims to want uh statehood, you know withdrawal [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1643.22s)]
*  All of this it's simply not possible logically [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1649.46s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I know I think this is a actual policy of suicide national suicide. So [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1653.78s)]
*  um on on much [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1659.1399999999999s)]
*  Much of the current discourse [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1661.3000000000002s)]
*  uh around [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1664.1000000000001s)]
*  You know the existing and continuous war on gaza and the destruction of gaza [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1665.94s)]
*  And I said this before to a lot of people and I still claim that this [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1671.0600000000002s)]
*  That gaza is the only part of palestine that actually has a concrete and real chance of actual survival [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1674.74s)]
*  Even as this genocidal war goes on [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1683.5400000000002s)]
*  i'm not saying well [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1686.9s)]
*  Sorry, yeah, i'm not saying it will but i'm saying that because this kind of split screen that I write about [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1688.58s)]
*  In the in the article which is you have a mall opening at ramallah [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1694.1799999999998s)]
*  And you have a genocide going on in gaza people think this is safer. Of course at this current moment historically [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1698.1799999999998s)]
*  These these two pictures provide a contrast [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1703.9399999999998s)]
*  But in reality if you think of the west bank as being the prize for the fascist settler movement if you think of how [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1706.58s)]
*  The pa is going deeper [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1712.4199999999998s)]
*  down, uh this trap of [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1714.4199999999998s)]
*  Delegitimizing itself in the eyes of the palestine people being completely beholden to aid [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1717.68s)]
*  Um, you know allowing for corruption and ethical [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1722.8200000000002s)]
*  You know a lack of ethics to to pervade [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1727.0600000000002s)]
*  Its own system and its own formation of people within that system as well [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1730.26s)]
*  That this will actually only either lead to internal violence among palestines themselves or slowly will also prevent [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1734.98s)]
*  uh the ability of the palestines to actually really [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1742.5s)]
*  Practice what they've always raised as the idea of sumut [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1746.02s)]
*  So I think that you know in many ways this is national suicide. I don't think the pa looks [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1750.34s)]
*  Towards the future that much. I think they manage day by day [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1755.46s)]
*  They try as much as possible to maintain themselves and buy time. I think that's the orientation of their policy [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1758.9s)]
*  There's no real strategy sometimes some initiatives here and there by some people within the pa that have some national sense like [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1764.66s)]
*  You know pursuing some sort of international organizations or icj or icc that exist [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1771.3799999999999s)]
*  But also it could be taken away because israel can pressure the pa leadership at any point and then these people are like withdrawn [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1776.98s)]
*  From the actual proceedings, but I don't think that there's you know, there's even now pretensions of trying to actually attain [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1783.78s)]
*  A realize a palestinian state and this is what I meant by abbas not having pragmatism [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1791.06s)]
*  Because if you're you're you're you know, your program is the realization of a state [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1796.1s)]
*  Then you will rethink your means [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1800.82s)]
*  As you move on and and you know try as much as as much as possible to create some movement politically [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1803.7s)]
*  Legally in terms of struggle allow for some [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1810.32s)]
*  Sort of politics of contestation and defiance to actually arise [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1813.7s)]
*  Within the west bank where you're the only real organized force within the west bank at this current moment [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1817.54s)]
*  There are organized forces, but they're very weak or feeble or still growing with no real concrete leadership arising from them [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1823.38s)]
*  so yeah, I mean [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1830.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I I don't think that that is [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1831.6200000000001s)]
*  Really something it's something they say but they don't really believe like the state [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1835.22s)]
*  Uh, they're happy and contained [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1839.8600000000001s)]
*  And you know and highly um [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1842.42s)]
*  content, I mean [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1845.22s)]
*  by just managing [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1846.82s)]
*  uh, you know the ruins and [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1848.58s)]
*  Whatever they get from the international community at this particular point and this is actually the contradiction on what as well [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1851.8600000000001s)]
*  Is that the international community weakens the pa [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1857.22s)]
*  by creating it as a subcontractor for uh, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1860.98s)]
*  Israel by financing that [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1864.98s)]
*  Subcontracting operation by promising a state and withdrawing that promise by not actually holding israel responsible by continue [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1868.08s)]
*  Continue by the continued support to israel financially and otherwise so they place them in this trap [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1875.86s)]
*  And then every once in a while you hear a new leader a new diplomat [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1881.7s)]
*  Uh claiming that we need to you know, create a reform within the pa, you know [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1886.26s)]
*  because [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1891.38s)]
*  On it's it's it's a quite, you know, weird tragic [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1892.18s)]
*  I think joke as well in many ways that you weaken the pa you placed it or you you [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1896.26s)]
*  Helped lend it a hand in its own [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1902.74s)]
*  uh delegitimization [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1905.68s)]
*  And what I called, you know this kind of national suicide [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1907.54s)]
*  Uh, but at the same time [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1911.06s)]
*  You still harken you still have this kind of nostalgia if you want [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1913.7s)]
*  For a pa that has strong support among its people that can actually [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1917.54s)]
*  Represent and embody the people at some level, you know [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1921.94s)]
*  So that's a contradiction that you still want to reform it in a way that makes it more acceptable, you know [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1924.6599999999999s)]
*  Uh that makes it more legitimate or legible for the palestinian people [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1929.46s)]
*  But you're you're the ones israel the u.s the you the ones that are actually, you know, uh creating the conditions for it to basically [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1932.5s)]
*  uh, you know, um, uh [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1940.74s)]
*  You know, uh [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1942.82s)]
*  completely, uh [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1944.26s)]
*  Become this kind of shameless [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1946.02s)]
*  collaborationist regime that we're seeing today [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1948.48s)]
*  So so all this stuff all the uh, you know the appointment of of hossein sheikh as deputy head of the plo [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1951.22s)]
*  uh [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1958.82s)]
*  the the the um the uh, the reintroduction of of of fatah members who were previously, uh, [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1959.86s)]
*  Excommunicated if you like [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1968.56s)]
*  I mean it all seems pretty pointless really [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1971.12s)]
*  I described it in my article as ironing the curtains while the house is on fire [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1975.04s)]
*  Or rearranging the deck chairs of titanic is another way of putting it. I mean [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1980.24s)]
*  If you're not serious about moving forward, so so who would want to be? [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1985.9199999999998s)]
*  president of the pa [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1990.94s)]
*  I mean, I guess some people want to I mean it seems that a lot of people are fighting over it and having uh, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=1994.08s)]
*  you know, um [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2000.32s)]
*  I'm not interested but you know in in in general. I think that [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2002.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think it it has a lot of meaning. I think it shows something about the historical trajectory of fatah [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2007.6799999999998s)]
*  The end of arafatism in in in the historical sense. It's complete, you know decaying. I think [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2014.8799999999999s)]
*  You know if you want that best one [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2021.6799999999998s)]
*  and [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2024.48s)]
*  his ideology of [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2025.52s)]
*  You know the permanency of defeat on one level, you know living within the horizon of defeat and continued [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2027.68s)]
*  Insistence that we are defeated people that will always remain defeated [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2034.3s)]
*  So, you know, we're trapped in this kind of horizon of defeat. We cannot come out of it in any significant way [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2037.76s)]
*  It's part of that kind of umbrella of what abbasism represents [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2044.32s)]
*  This kind of internalization of defeat the accumulation of capital and financial gain that we talked about [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2048.56s)]
*  And to some degree the commodification of palestinian revolutionary history like [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2055.04s)]
*  Which I think is part of you know, this creation of lifeless museum and in fact if you come to ramallah [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2059.8399999999997s)]
*  next to a muqata where abbas [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2066.3999999999996s)]
*  you know, um, it's like our own, uh white house it used to actually be a prison and also a british military, um, [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2069.2799999999997s)]
*  Outpost that controlled ramallah then an israeli military outpost and then a jordanian and then [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2077.8399999999997s)]
*  Uh, no jordanian then israeli then a palestinian one and now it's the president's palace but next to it is actually arafat's museum [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2082.3199999999997s)]
*  That's right. Yeah, and I think this is this is quite emblematic of the pa because it's long live arafat but arafat is dead [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2089.7599999999998s)]
*  No [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2096.64s)]
*  Yeah, the real one is is abbas with this, you know with this commodification that because we had [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2097.52s)]
*  This revolutionary history we can now expand it [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2105.12s)]
*  In this [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2108.9599999999996s)]
*  Eternalization of defeat. It's instead of a revolutionary becoming defeated and perhaps going home and sitting with his family [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2110.24s)]
*  Um, it's a revolutionary that still wants to play some role and create some sense of relevance [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2117.9199999999996s)]
*  Uh, but on terms that are now different and I think that you know, it it has completely inverted [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2124.72s)]
*  Uh the palestine liberation organization from an organization that sought liberation to an organization that kills the possibility of liberation liberation [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2130.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I I mean it is quite remarkable, especially given the narrative that we we we talk we we give each other [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2137.92s)]
*  We we we're proud of our history proud of our resistance proud of our support our our steadfastness [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2145.28s)]
*  um, I mean and there must be people within fatah who must feel [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2152.48s)]
*  uh [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2158.48s)]
*  Embarrassed for want of a better word at this state of affairs and and in this context when when when abbas [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2159.92s)]
*  uh [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2166.4s)]
*  When abbas granted an amnesty to to former fatah members there was a lot of talk about this being a an opening for [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2169.12s)]
*  um [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2176.7200000000003s)]
*  mohammed dahlan [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2177.84s)]
*  Uh, the erstwhile gaza strongman to make a return [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2179.44s)]
*  Who was also supposed to be close to um the u.a leadership. I mean [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2183.44s)]
*  Is there not turmoil in within the fatah movement? [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2189.2000000000003s)]
*  Uh, and and and and in general in the west bank, I mean there must be a lot of unhappy people [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2194.0s)]
*  You say of course it looks like stability, but [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2199.2799999999997s)]
*  What is stability in the absence of any hope for a better future? [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2202.72s)]
*  Well, I mean I think that uh [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2207.3599999999997s)]
*  I'll speak to that now because I think there there's two questions here on a political level like I don't think that [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2210.72s)]
*  There's an actual struggle that is ideological or political in nature within the pa [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2217.04s)]
*  Okay, so there's no camps or people with different strategic choices or [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2222.48s)]
*  Things of that sort what we're seeing even when you mentioned mohammed dahlan what we're seeing is just [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2228.1600000000003s)]
*  Who will hold the levers of power? It's it's a it's a much more [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2232.8s)]
*  You know self-interested cynical form of power play [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2236.96s)]
*  That revolves around the same option but in different faces, you know [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2241.6800000000003s)]
*  So whether it's hussain is sheikh mohammed dahlan or any other it's it's the same [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2245.28s)]
*  Uh result with you know, minute differences relating to the [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2249.3599999999997s)]
*  Personality and the charisma or political presence and and their personal histories [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2253.2799999999997s)]
*  When it comes so there's no there's no that turmoil now [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2259.04s)]
*  Whether within fatah is wider social based are people who are unhappy of course because I think that for for many [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2262.16s)]
*  Uh who relate to fatah relate to it also in terms of its revolutionary [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2268.7999999999997s)]
*  history and persistent participation in palestinian struggle including in the first and second intifadas [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2274.16s)]
*  Uh, you know, there are people like that, but they're sidelined [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2279.44s)]
*  They're unorganized and they're they're not forging what we can say as something that could [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2283.12s)]
*  Resemble some sort of political coherence that could actually challenge the current leadership [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2288.72s)]
*  And it's a monopolization of power [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2293.3599999999997s)]
*  So that's that's on another level, but so there's no contestation. I mean and that that leaves us a second question [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2296.0s)]
*  Which I think that you know [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2302.4s)]
*  What is felt is felt in the interiority of you know our very existence here meaning in our [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2304.08s)]
*  You know sense of alienation [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2311.04s)]
*  Feeling that there's no future people, you know joke about we're next [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2315.52s)]
*  people joke about saying goodbye to [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2321.36s)]
*  You know places and scenes and others, you know, there there is a sense that this is the end times ensemble, you know [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2324.64s)]
*  Um, but I I think that also that kind of play around it is is is telling it tells us that people are not feeling [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2331.76s)]
*  Good. Nobody's really [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2340.16s)]
*  Um, you know present completely I spoke about this avowal, but I think that deep down [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2341.92s)]
*  Uh, yeah in the west bank. There's a lot of contestation going on within people's own, you know, let's say [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2348.2400000000002s)]
*  uh, um, you know own [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2354.32s)]
*  Discussions and conversations with themselves and intimate loved ones [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2357.36s)]
*  There is that contestation there, but will it actually become something more political? [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2362.0800000000004s)]
*  This is like a hidden transcript that people are you know, why nothing is happening or [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2367.04s)]
*  what is to be done or [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2372.2400000000002s)]
*  why we have failed at this particular moment or [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2374.5600000000004s)]
*  To what extent are we sanitized to the destruction and massacres that we've seen and we still see daily in gaza [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2378.2400000000002s)]
*  You know, so there's all these questions around uh, what what is you know, what is [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2385.6s)]
*  what what does it mean to hold to unwork or meaning or family or life or [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2391.44s)]
*  within these conditions, these are things that people are speaking about discussing and [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2397.52s)]
*  or uh attempting to uh, uh create some sensibility around it, but I think that [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2402.96s)]
*  I I still haven't seen signs because I think that this is [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2409.44s)]
*  The the monstrosity in which israel was both permitted to act and continues to act [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2413.52s)]
*  Have you know destabilized? [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2419.92s)]
*  Palestinian self-perception and relationship [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2422.32s)]
*  To themselves. I mean it's like [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2425.6800000000003s)]
*  suddenly israel, you know [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2428.48s)]
*  un [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2431.42s)]
*  Unconcealed its truth [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2432.7200000000003s)]
*  Uh, it's not that we didn't know that truth. We knew it but it's it came with this such intensity [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2434.56s)]
*  With such sadism with such, uh, uh with taking pleasure with our pain [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2440.48s)]
*  With total destruction inhalation that uses technology, etc [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2447.52s)]
*  and a world that uh supports and lends to israel that it's it's not a revolutionary moment of flowing whether it's in the west [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2451.52s)]
*  Jerusalem and other places even in places where there's [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2460.24s)]
*  You know an intimate encounter with the israeli police officer like jerusalem [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2463.36s)]
*  Not like ramallah where we still have like spatial separateness from the settler and the you know officer and uh military [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2466.7999999999997s)]
*  You know presence, uh more broadly, uh, you know physical I mean spatial separation at least so you see that people are you know [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2474.96s)]
*  You know kind of shrinking in their homes, etc [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2483.3599999999997s)]
*  But these hidden transcripts are still you know part of I think what is being prescribed for the future [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2486.96s)]
*  But for now, I think people are demobilized by fear and by anxiety of their own, uh future here [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2493.2s)]
*  Um [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2502.08s)]
*  What would it take to change that? I mean clearly no help is forthcoming from the outside world [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2503.12s)]
*  uh [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2510.16s)]
*  Clearly no help is coming from the leadership of the pa [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2511.6s)]
*  um [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2515.8399999999997s)]
*  and [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2517.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I mean [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2518.72s)]
*  I I understand that you're describing [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2520.56s)]
*  Effectively an existential crisis for for palestinians in the west bank more so I guess than [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2523.18s)]
*  you know, or at least in a different way than two people in gaza, but um [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2528.88s)]
*  But often those moments, uh can be galvanizing um and [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2535.28s)]
*  Given the fact that uh, you know [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2543.76s)]
*  The the palestinian leadership the plo leadership [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2546.96s)]
*  Pa plo, it's been interchangeable unfortunately for a while [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2550.64s)]
*  um [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2554.48s)]
*  Is not even invited to important regional [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2555.6s)]
*  summits on the future of gaza [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2559.44s)]
*  a that the palestinian [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2562.16s)]
*  voice [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2565.04s)]
*  In in such fora has become irrelevant [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2566.48s)]
*  a [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2570.72s)]
*  When is this going when or will it? [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2572.0s)]
*  Galvanize some kind of uh, uh alternative [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2575.1s)]
*  Well, honestly that's uh quite difficult [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2581.3599999999997s)]
*  Question to actually try and disentangle one of the things that we should understand on a structural level [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2585.52s)]
*  On what is that whether we want it or not? [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2590.64s)]
*  You know, there will be a day that palestinians the west bank will have to confront [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2594.08s)]
*  uh [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2599.2s)]
*  You know the occupation not because we desire it necessarily it just yeah, this is the fact of life, you know, like [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2600.32s)]
*  Uh, you know resistance as I always say is not really a choice [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2607.28s)]
*  It's not an ideological choice and people like, you know discussing it, you know [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2610.8s)]
*  Outside in the west. I think sometimes think like, you know palestinians are sitting comfortably and then they decide to resist [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2614.4s)]
*  It's it's something that you know, you feel trapped [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2619.84s)]
*  And with aboumaz and we we find somebody who's comfortable in in the hole [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2622.7200000000003s)]
*  In the trap itself, but when you feel trapped and and the walls are closing you'll you'll always try to [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2627.84s)]
*  Find ways out of that exit. So I think that on that level that structural component will always lead to some sort of [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2634.0s)]
*  Galvanization the rise of movements the rise of new [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2640.7s)]
*  generations, etc [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2644.3s)]
*  um, I think at this moment there's there's a sense of [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2646.32s)]
*  Despair a sense of hopelessness sense of you know, it's a fear as well like seeping in [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2649.84s)]
*  um in in in many [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2656.56s)]
*  Among many palestinians and their cautions is there's a there's also the killing of the camps in the north of the west bank [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2659.52s)]
*  Which has been ongoing operation with a lot of with tens of thousands of palestinians being displaced new realities being you know [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2664.56s)]
*  created [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2671.76s)]
*  And new ways to adapt to these realities [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2672.72s)]
*  but there are three things that I would think say that are not [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2675.76s)]
*  necessarily as [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2679.28s)]
*  pessimistic as people make them out to be first [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2680.8s)]
*  Israel despite the fact that it has been going with this war for a year and a half now, uh, even more [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2683.52s)]
*  It did not really decisively end [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2692.7200000000003s)]
*  anything, no [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2696.56s)]
*  It's yearning for this kind of decisive end for palestinian presence claims demands for even us raising questions [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2699.76s)]
*  uh, you know unconcealing its [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2707.12s)]
*  Uh [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2709.2s)]
*  Realities and and and showing the world its real truth [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2710.4s)]
*  And I think there a lot of that has already occurred a lot of discussions people have already had [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2713.68s)]
*  And and you know a new reality is also seeping in uh, uh in relation [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2718.48s)]
*  Uh between israel and its relationship to the world, you know, there's something that happened there [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2724.16s)]
*  But more broadly it hasn't really decisively ended anything [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2728.72s)]
*  You know, it speaks of making gaza unbearable on a level but but people are still finding some sort of form of life even within [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2732.16s)]
*  You know this kind of horizon of catastrophe and destruction and massacres [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2738.72s)]
*  And of course people in the gaza won the end of the war, you know from the first moment this war started [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2742.96s)]
*  But I think that you know, there's still this kind of yearning for this absolute total victory [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2748.24s)]
*  A victory that they cannot actually achieve is is quite problematic for the israelis [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2755.44s)]
*  Despite all their gains and tactical agility and what happened in syria and what happened in lebanon [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2760.3199999999997s)]
*  There's something that is also over extending itself something that is making itself, you know, um [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2766.1s)]
*  Not being able to turn this moment from some tactical successes [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2774.18s)]
*  into [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2779.3s)]
*  a political [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2780.34s)]
*  A new political reality and I think this kind of endless war is a symptom of actually israeli failure rather than [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2781.86s)]
*  than anything else because it's keep it keeps yearning for [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2788.9s)]
*  You know the end of everything but at the same time it cannot really attain that end [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2793.2999999999997s)]
*  So that's one level of it, you know, and I think [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2797.7799999999997s)]
*  That that should give us some uh something to look [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2800.8199999999997s)]
*  Towards the second thing I think is that we're seeing an actual decay decay in israeli institutions [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2804.5s)]
*  And the relationship between politicians and military and intelligence. We're actually seeing [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2811.06s)]
*  Distrust we're seeing some sort of slow implosion [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2815.44s)]
*  Within israel [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2819.2400000000002s)]
*  And I think that implosion is is is quite also significant at least to what israel becomes [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2820.5200000000004s)]
*  In in the years months ahead, but in the crisis of reproduction within the zionist [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2826.84s)]
*  Entity itself and its ability to actually also provision some sort of futurity [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2832.92s)]
*  To its own settlers that is one of the problems that also zionism is also facing [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2838.92s)]
*  It's also facing existential questions [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2844.2s)]
*  And war is not really giving it the full answers it needs [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2846.3599999999997s)]
*  So that's that's a problem on their part and and it continues, you know the circle between the different factions [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2850.04s)]
*  The only difference is that what we see in israel is the politics of contestation unlike us [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2855.56s)]
*  We see it happening on the streets. You know, we see we see kind of this vibe in society still fighting for uh, [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2861.08s)]
*  various elements [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2867.48s)]
*  That's that's what not what not what we're seeing for instance at the west bank or [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2868.2s)]
*  There is there is a politics there is contestation there's fights, you know that happened between the junean brigades and the palestinian authority [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2872.7599999999998s)]
*  but a larger more [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2879.56s)]
*  More political contestation that is taken to the streets were not nearly uh witnessed [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2883.7999999999997s)]
*  um, and I think the last thing i'll say here is that um, [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2889.8799999999997s)]
*  Within this moment these moments of transitions if you want to omit it's hard to really [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2896.12s)]
*  Uh, you know create but I think one of the very conservative [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2900.7599999999998s)]
*  Uh, and this is you know, quite a leap on my my end [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2905.96s)]
*  but one of the conservative elements of palestinian collective thinking if you want this kind of [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2909.56s)]
*  base thinking is that [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2915.32s)]
*  You know what happened in gaza? [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2917.8s)]
*  And what's going on and still going on in gaza and the war? [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2920.92s)]
*  Um of destruction and genocide happening [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2926.6s)]
*  and [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2930.12s)]
*  while [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2931.32s)]
*  People in the west bank in jerusalem and within 48 cannot meet the demands of this moment in terms of political [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2932.12s)]
*  participation and contestation or have kind of [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2938.2599999999998s)]
*  Collectively decided that this is a moment that is too real [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2941.54s)]
*  And they found themselves without real leadership [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2946.04s)]
*  Can really take us to two [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2949.48s)]
*  You know two different trajectories that are highly [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2951.56s)]
*  Um [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2954.04s)]
*  You know, uh differential if you want because on on the one level there's this kind of insistence on what we call an arabic baqa [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2956.92s)]
*  Which is a very passive word which is just remaining, you know [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2965.88s)]
*  Very passive. We're just going to remain [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2969.48s)]
*  We're going to stay here [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2972.36s)]
*  Just by our sheer presence and by being here. We're still a problem [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2974.12s)]
*  And a problem they will have very little problem [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2978.84s)]
*  A lot of problems in actually solving specifically since the setter is always unsettled by, you know, your sheer presence, no sure [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2982.44s)]
*  so there's this kind of [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2990.3599999999997s)]
*  politics of [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2992.04s)]
*  remaining [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2993.56s)]
*  politics of not you know, uh leaving or not immigrating [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2994.68s)]
*  Insisting and affirming on a life here in in this various ways even even through this kind of business as usual [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=2999.08s)]
*  Uh life that people are living that's one element of it [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3006.44s)]
*  And I think uh it it speaks to an awareness that at least [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3009.3199999999997s)]
*  Among the society here was if we're not ready for this moment and people fully participate [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3019.7999999999997s)]
*  Within the horizon of this moment [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3026.7599999999998s)]
*  It could back [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3029.24s)]
*  Backlash on us without real and actual preparation [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3031.7999999999997s)]
*  So at least there is an element of that like I sense it in what how people speak and how people [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3034.7599999999998s)]
*  Relate to this moment more broadly and what we need to do [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3040.2s)]
*  Yeah, just hold us up [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3044.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3046.3599999999997s)]
*  Also, i'm just gonna say isro has clearly tried to make an example of of gaza to say [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3047.64s)]
*  Don't dare do anything similar because this is what you're gonna meet. This is the fate you're gonna meet [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3053.96s)]
*  having having lost its [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3059.3999999999996s)]
*  deterrent image [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3061.8599999999997s)]
*  On october 7 it has been trying to reestablish that and to some success by the sounds of it [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3063.72s)]
*  Uh to some success. Yeah, of course. I mean, yes, there is a lot of successes on that [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3071.56s)]
*  But the problem with success with israel is that success is is not sufficient anymore. It's it has to be absolute [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3075.64s)]
*  you know, like [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3082.52s)]
*  If you have fascists leading your government and they're the [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3083.7999999999997s)]
*  You know dogmatic ideologues [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3087.72s)]
*  The success the threshold of success is so high [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3090.4399999999996s)]
*  That they can never really attain it. No, like this is one of the problems that they have [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3093.7999999999997s)]
*  The second thing is that with with october 7th, you know this whole ideological shield of the iron wall fell [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3097.08s)]
*  And no matter how much they fill it. It doesn't seem to be full. No, like they're they're practicing between genocide [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3104.2s)]
*  Uh, you know, they have these allies that are giving weapons and covering up they have mainstream media [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3110.2s)]
*  Not really highlighting what crimes are doing and trying as much as possible to maintain this narrative of israel as a liberal [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3115.48s)]
*  Start-up nation that you know kills people but we shouldn't talk about the you know, israel being killed [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3121.96s)]
*  Despite all of that, you know success is is you know, it's your own [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3128.7599999999998s)]
*  Dream of and fantasy and desire. I think you know israel now as much as it's being [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3133.72s)]
*  You know driven by these kind of calculative machines like ai and the logarithms and [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3139.0s)]
*  By military institutions and by planning and liberation and kind of rational end means discussions [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3144.04s)]
*  It's also being driven by this kind of base desires, you know [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3151.02s)]
*  And when you're driven by base desires you you you know, you're you're [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3154.94s)]
*  You're you're also not as you know, uh [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3159.5s)]
*  Rational if you want as as I don't like that word, but you're not as rational as [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3163.9s)]
*  As as you might seem so there are a lot of sufficient successes [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3168.94s)]
*  Of course, if if you're telling palestinians of the west bank [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3171.82s)]
*  I'm gonna take your young son and put them in prison and make them hungry [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3174.7000000000003s)]
*  You know because they went on a protest in al-manar square, which is does not really do anything to the system or the regime [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3178.62s)]
*  Of course people are not going to go out in al-manar and because they're not going to spend you know [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3186.14s)]
*  two years in prison, you know being tortured beaten brutalized by [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3190.2200000000003s)]
*  soldiers and and prison guards [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3194.94s)]
*  Uh and becoming hungry, of course that kind of corrosion plays a big role [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3197.1800000000003s)]
*  So that that is always part of the picture and of course it disciplines people and quiets them [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3201.9s)]
*  But also on the same time there is that politics of affirmation that I was trying to place on even within this kind of [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3206.7000000000003s)]
*  We will remain we're still a problem. We will not leave [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3212.54s)]
*  Uh, no matter what happens we will you know bear because I think what also gaza has [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3215.98s)]
*  Taught us indirectly in the west bank this kind of politics of sumo despite everything, you know [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3221.7400000000002s)]
*  You know that that is a lesson also of gaza. The lesson of gaza is not as you know is spoken about [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3228.46s)]
*  only in terms of [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3233.7400000000002s)]
*  You know being left alone and abandoned that's also a part of it [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3236.14s)]
*  It's not only about the the out of sync between the west bank and gaza which is you know [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3239.1s)]
*  Which has been going on for 30 years. I'm somebody who's 36, but I haven't never visited gaza. Although it's one hour away [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3243.34s)]
*  You know, there's there's that kind of distance despite the closeness and proximity of more places [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3249.98s)]
*  but [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3255.58s)]
*  What is very fundamental is that the lesson of gaza for the rest of? [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3256.86s)]
*  Palestinians is that no matter what we you have to insist on remaining or or try at least your best remaining [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3261.1s)]
*  I'm not here speaking of every individual on every show show show show show [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3267.9s)]
*  But i'm speaking of this kind of collective ethos that is you know [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3271.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, you know committed and that's something that actually people registered [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3275.42s)]
*  Yeah, they speak, you know, like it's it's it's registering one people now, of course [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3279.74s)]
*  They tell themselves if if you know if they start blowing up ramallah, I don't know if i'll remain [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3284.38s)]
*  You know like people start people have choice [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3289.58s)]
*  That's one of the lessons that people are learning from gaza that I think is registering is that [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3292.86s)]
*  You know we can still in front of this machinic [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3297.02s)]
*  Violence that israel's practicing the systematic obscene genocide that is you know conducting that you know, it's still vulnerable [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3300.22s)]
*  It's still weak that within the premise of you know, their smiles [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3307.5s)]
*  As they kill people and you know massacre paramedics [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3313.1s)]
*  it shows [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3317.1s)]
*  Unability, uh, it shows sadistic [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3318.44s)]
*  Violence it shows that they're unsettled more than we are actually unsettled, you know, I mean we've grown claustrophobic [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3323.32s)]
*  We're already claustrophobic. No, we're already confined. We're already living here within the horizon and fine enough today. I mean, uh, I think it's uh, [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3329.64s)]
*  I'm not sure. I think it's either the the independence day in israel's celebration or the you know, the memorial for the soldiers that have fallen since [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3339.64s)]
*  Uh 1948 in israel [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3347.32s)]
*  And fires are opting everywhere. The you know, the weather is quite, uh gloomy and [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3349.6400000000003s)]
*  You know dusty and fires and winds everywhere and you know [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3357.5600000000004s)]
*  within this moment of them, uh of a day of remembrance or [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3361.6400000000003s)]
*  Celebration of what they call their independence. There's this kind of scenes of fires actually burning cars and [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3366.26s)]
*  Uh, and you know even that made it into their uh, [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3372.76s)]
*  News as what's happening to us, you know, what's going on who who made this fire happen because [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3376.44s)]
*  There's always the sense of insecurity that israeli society feeds on it and continues to live on [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3383.2400000000002s)]
*  And I think here it's you know, it's different. I think that you know, we're you know, palestinians are much more resilient than even in the west bank [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3388.52s)]
*  You know, you know, there's not the the spectacle of politics [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3395.7200000000003s)]
*  Right now [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3400.2000000000003s)]
*  It's quite quiet [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3401.48s)]
*  Uh, people are struggling in their own ways people are sneaking into their homes in refugee camps in juneen [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3404.44s)]
*  Uh, you know people are trying their best to make life happen [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3411.8s)]
*  Despite the fact that for a year and a half also many palestinians have lost their daily means [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3416.52s)]
*  um, you know, there's still some sort of uh, [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3422.2s)]
*  Politics of care happening among people the heading transcript questions [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3425.72s)]
*  So it's not it's not the story that the media, uh, uh [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3430.44s)]
*  Feeds and and it is it is a story in of itself this discrepancy between gaza and the west bank that some people amplify too much [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3436.2s)]
*  But I think that that there's also a lot of lessons that are being also transferred from gaza, uh into the west bank [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3444.28s)]
*  Yeah, and and this despite the practices of the occupation [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3450.84s)]
*  And despite I should add probably the pa itself [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3455.4s)]
*  I mean, I think the the final question here would be [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3460.04s)]
*  Given given its lack of legitimacy [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3464.92s)]
*  popular political electoral [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3469.08s)]
*  Given its unpopularity [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3471.56s)]
*  Given the fact that it's become irrelevant regionally [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3473.88s)]
*  You know saudi arabia doesn't invite it to the summit. Uh, egypt didn't invite them to the summit [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3477.64s)]
*  Um, what is the future for given this unpopularity? What is the future for the pa? What can the future of the pa be? [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3482.68s)]
*  Well, look I I don't think that there's a real concrete future for the pa because I think [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3492.04s)]
*  Two pressures that will kill it. The first is its own. Um [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3497.56s)]
*  hubris [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3503.16s)]
*  Its own corruption in its own excesses [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3504.52s)]
*  One of the elements where the pa is actually really pragmatic is that it tries as much as possible not to interfere in society in ways [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3508.28s)]
*  That makes society, you know rise against it [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3515.48s)]
*  but in in [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3519.2400000000002s)]
*  I think the more it's financially deprived it will actually tax people more the more it, you know needs [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3521.2400000000002s)]
*  uh, you know people to be [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3528.36s)]
*  disciplined and more [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3531.38s)]
*  Subjugated the more you know the americans demand from it that it needs to conduct operations or the israeli in junin [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3533.08s)]
*  The more that antagonism will actually rise within palestine society also on a personal level because we should understand that within the west bank [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3538.44s)]
*  People know each other there's family relationships. There's something wrong [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3546.12s)]
*  You know the culture of family and and you know somebody from the pa police [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3550.12s)]
*  You know killing somebody from the brigades and that relationship [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3556.04s)]
*  And contestation will continue for years to come [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3560.54s)]
*  yeah, but uh [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3563.5s)]
*  The reason why I don't think there's a future for the pa is because also because the settlers that [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3565.9s)]
*  you know [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3571.26s)]
*  Uh live in the west bank and their leaders specifically people like being very unsmuttered [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3572.7000000000003s)]
*  They don't want the pa [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3578.06s)]
*  They don't want any [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3579.98s)]
*  again israeli dependency on the palestines even in collaboration [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3582.06s)]
*  Um, it's interesting actually because we were talking about the [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3586.7999999999997s)]
*  The plo falling into a trap with the pa but in some ways, of course israel is also trapped by the pa [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3590.08s)]
*  Yeah, because it kind of needs it and [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3595.7599999999998s)]
*  At the same time doesn't want it. Yeah [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3598.9599999999996s)]
*  So it's it's hot in that mind and I think the the fascists that are leading israel now they simply [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3601.7599999999998s)]
*  You know want to be [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3608.0s)]
*  Liberated from that mind from having the pa [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3609.8399999999997s)]
*  They [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3612.72s)]
*  Claim that you know, it's palestinian hold a flag or [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3614.16s)]
*  Represent or embody something about palestinian life [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3618.7s)]
*  but not only that also because they don't want palestinians here at all and any dependence on the palestinians is frowned upon even again in [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3621.4399999999996s)]
*  collaboration or uh [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3628.54s)]
*  You know complete cooperation. So, you know your your employer the one who actually, you know [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3631.04s)]
*  Lubricates you financially also is thinking of firing you that's [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3638.0s)]
*  That's what's happening with with the palestinian authority as well [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3643.2000000000003s)]
*  Um, or is asking you to reform yourself, but slowly he's also thinking of how he can get rid of it. So [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3646.48s)]
*  That politics from within palestinian society the politics coming also from [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3653.36s)]
*  You know trumpism and the rise of new right-wing governments across the west and and these movements but also within his role itself [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3657.36s)]
*  Tells me that the pa is not you know [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3665.92s)]
*  Gonna last for a long time at least [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3669.2000000000003s)]
*  uh, if i'm you know, if i'm able to do this kind of [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3671.2000000000003s)]
*  Historical projection, I think this is why it's kind of also on some level it realizes this [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3675.12s)]
*  And for those leaders within the pa they act [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3680.48s)]
*  You know, uh that the end at some point is soon [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3683.68s)]
*  Um, they've already prepared themselves contingency plans for themselves and families outside of palestine [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3687.92s)]
*  Most of them have these contingency plans, but beyond that element [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3693.2799999999997s)]
*  The element that is truly is that this is this is you know, there's the game [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3698.3199999999997s)]
*  And we're gonna try as much as possible to keep it going on [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3702.0s)]
*  Until it's game over. So, you know, that's that's their thinking and that's why they don't have a political program a strategy [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3705.2799999999997s)]
*  they think beyond [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3712.16s)]
*  Continuing with the the habits and the habitualization of cooperation and collaboration [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3714.54s)]
*  Uh as we move on [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3720.42s)]
*  And that is why we see hubristic things like the opening of that mega mall that you that you wrote about [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3722.74s)]
*  um [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3729.3s)]
*  I think that's a good place to leave it slightly. Um [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3730.42s)]
*  Uh despondent I must admit but there you go [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3734.5s)]
*  Thank you. I'll do you add on uh for joining us the podcast and I hope we get to have another conversation soon [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3737.46s)]
*  Very interesting. Thank you. Thank you. I'm glad to be with you [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3744.74s)]
*  You [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRnMI7XQqzw&t=3749.54s)]
