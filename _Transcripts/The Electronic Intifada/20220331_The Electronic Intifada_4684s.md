Video Description: On episode 53, The Electronic Intifada’s director Ali Abunimah joins Asa and Nora for a roundtable discussion on Ukraine, NATO, the imperialist push toward war with Russia and how it all relates to Palestine.
On 20 March, Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, addressed Israel’s parliament, the Knesset. He used the occasion to heap praise on Israel’s settler-colonial regime.
Zelensky called on Israel to send more weapons to Ukraine than it has already.
“Everyone in Israel knows that your missile defense is the best. It is powerful. Everyone knows that your weapon is strong. Everyone knows you’re doing great,” Zelensky said.
“You know how to defend your state interests, the interests of your people. And you can definitely help us protect our lives, the lives of Ukrainians, the lives of Ukrainian Jews,” he added.
Since the beginning of the Russian invasion, Ali explains, “we’ve constantly been seeing Ukrainian officials pleading for Israeli weapons and praising Israeli weapons, without of course ever mentioning that those Israeli weapons are tested on Palestinians, against defenseless Palestinian civilians.”
What has been consistent, he adds, “is Ukraine’s insistence that Ukraine not be identified with the Palestinians, but that Ukraine be identified with Israel.”

We also discuss the ramifications of the massive propaganda campaign to sanitize the Nazi battalions inside Ukrainian forces, the expansion of Western hegemony and what this war could mean for the future of the entire planet.
Asa talks about the concealed history of the West’s rehabilitation of top Nazi officers and their integration into secret anti-communist armies after World War II. Today, Asa says, we are seeing the ongoing normalization of Nazis when we look at the situation in Ukraine.

# Whitewashing Ukraine's Nazis, in conversation with Ali Abunimah | EI Podcast
**The Electronic Intifada:** [March 31, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s)
*  The point is that the nationalist cult that the Ukrainian state has nurtured since 2014 [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=0.0s)]
*  is the cult of Stepan Bandera. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=20.48s)]
*  The electronic intifada. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=24.96s)]
*  The electronic intifada. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=25.96s)]
*  The electronic intifada. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=26.96s)]
*  This is the electronic intifada podcast. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=28.92s)]
*  I'm Nora Barrows-Freedman. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=31.92s)]
*  And I'm Asa Winstanley. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=34.24s)]
*  Hello and welcome to the electronic intifada podcast. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=40.44s)]
*  Myself and my co-host Nora Barrows-Freedman are here today with our colleague, Ali Abunimah. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=44.36s)]
*  Thank you, Ali, for joining us. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=50.68s)]
*  How are you doing? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=52.16s)]
*  Very good Asa. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  It's always great to be on the electronic intifada podcast. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  My favourite podcast. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=57.6s)]
*  Yeah, mine too. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=59.08s)]
*  So today we are going to have a bit of a roundtable discussion about Ukraine and everything that's [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=61.64s)]
*  been happening in Ukraine. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=68.04s)]
*  The war in Ukraine, the geopolitical fallout and the general political implications of [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=70.08s)]
*  the war and the aftermath of the war. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=77.84s)]
*  So we thought that a good place to start would be to talk about the recent speech of the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  Ukrainian president Vladimir Zelenskyy to Israel's Knesset. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=87.2s)]
*  So what did you make of it? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=94.52000000000001s)]
*  Let's first go to a little clip of that, just some highlights and then we'll talk about [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=97.4s)]
*  it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=102.76s)]
*  Ukrainian and Jewish community always were and I'm sure will be very intertwined, very [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=103.76s)]
*  close. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=111.2s)]
*  Now I want to remind you the words that you know very well, Golda Meir said, we want to [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=112.2s)]
*  live. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  Our neighbours want to see us dead. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=123.44s)]
*  We are in different countries. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=126.76s)]
*  We are absolutely in different conditions. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=128.94s)]
*  However, the threat is the same for you and me, for you and us. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=132.2s)]
*  Total destruction of people, culture, state and even the name of Ukraine. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=139.36s)]
*  I have the right to draw this parallel and this comparison in our history and your history [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=144.60000000000002s)]
*  in our wars for survival and the Second World War. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=151.08s)]
*  Listen to what Kremlin is saying, simply listen to that. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=157.60000000000002s)]
*  They even use such terminology that were mentioned then when the Nazi party was marching through [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=162.4s)]
*  Europe and wanted to destroy everyone and everything to subjugate peoples and to destroy [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=171.72s)]
*  us and you completely without even a word. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=180.24s)]
*  They were calling it the final solution for the Jewish question. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=185.44s)]
*  You remember that and you will never forget that. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=190.64000000000001s)]
*  But you are hearing what they are speaking these words again, the final solution in respect [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=195.04000000000002s)]
*  to us, to the Ukrainian question, to us. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  That was spoken out loud. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=208.44s)]
*  This what Moscow is saying without the war against us. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=211.64000000000001s)]
*  They would not have ensured the final solution for their safety exactly in the same way [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=216.5s)]
*  and it was spoken 80 years ago. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=222.42s)]
*  Everyone in Israel knows that your anti-missile defence is the best, it's very powerful. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=226.22s)]
*  Everyone knows that your arms are very powerful. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=232.86s)]
*  Everyone knows that you are great. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=236.74s)]
*  You know how to stand for your state interests, interests of your people. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=238.98s)]
*  You definitely can help our people. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=245.46s)]
*  One could ask and ask why we cannot receive arms from you or why Israel did not implement [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=248.14s)]
*  powerful sanctions against Russia to affect Russian business. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=257.58s)]
*  It's interesting because when Russia first invaded Ukraine, I remember there was this [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=262.9s)]
*  huge, it's a month ago now, this huge outpouring of instant reaction from I think a lot of [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=270.41999999999996s)]
*  well-meaning people saying Ukraine is being treated like Palestine. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=279.53999999999996s)]
*  It's being invaded, its people are resisting, this is an illegal invasion, occupation just [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=286.5s)]
*  like what Israel is doing to the Palestinians. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=293.62s)]
*  There's certainly some merit in those arguments. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=296.9s)]
*  I for one think anyone whose country is being invaded, no matter what the reason, has the [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=301.06s)]
*  right to resist that invasion. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=307.53999999999996s)]
*  Ukrainians have that right. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=309.86s)]
*  You'll get no argument about that from me even if we want to talk about the causes and [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=312.09999999999997s)]
*  background to this war. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=319.86s)]
*  But what's been consistent all along, and we see this in Zelensky's speech, is Ukraine's [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=321.70000000000005s)]
*  insistence that Ukraine not be identified with the Palestinians, but that Ukraine be [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=328.42s)]
*  identified with Israel. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=335.22s)]
*  Zelensky makes this very clear in the Knesset speech that we, Ukraine, are like you, Israel, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=337.38000000000005s)]
*  and our enemies are like your enemies. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=344.1s)]
*  Therefore, on the Israeli side, it would be the Palestinians, and on the Ukrainian [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=346.98s)]
*  side, it would be the Russians. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=353.22s)]
*  Therefore, the Palestinians are the Russians as far as Zelensky is concerned. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=354.42s)]
*  Zelensky is not the first one to say this. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=360.66s)]
*  This has been consistent from Ukrainian officials since even before the Russian invasion. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=363.46000000000004s)]
*  During the invasion, we saw similar statements from Vitaly Klitschko, the mayor of Kiev, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=372.34s)]
*  who said how much he admires the Israeli army and how the Israeli army is his model for [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=377.85999999999996s)]
*  how to defend Kiev. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=385.21999999999997s)]
*  We've constantly been seeing Ukrainian officials pleading for Israeli weapons and praising [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=388.65999999999997s)]
*  Israeli weapons without ever mentioning that those Israeli weapons are tested on Palestinians [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=395.38s)]
*  against defenseless Palestinian civilians. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=405.94s)]
*  Zelensky, of course, alluded to the historic role of Ukrainian Jews in Israel, in Palestine. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=411.14s)]
*  I knew a little bit about that, but I learned a lot more reading a recent piece by Joseph [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=421.62s)]
*  Mashad that was published in Middle East Eye that I think we can link to. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=428.18s)]
*  He points out that really the first Zionist colonists to go to Palestine as early as the [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=435.21999999999997s)]
*  1880s were Ukrainian Jews. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=443.21999999999997s)]
*  The first Palestinian peasant revolt against colonization of their land was against [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=446.18s)]
*  Ukrainian Jewish colonists. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=453.62s)]
*  So really, the historic role of Ukraine in the dispossession of the Palestinian people [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=455.3s)]
*  goes back more than a century. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=461.62s)]
*  Mashad also points out how Odessa, which is now part of Ukraine, but was an Ottoman [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=465.06s)]
*  town called Hegibay on the shores of the Black Sea, was conquered by Russia in the late [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=472.42s)]
*  18th century, I think the 1790s. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=483.94s)]
*  It was conquered by Catherine the Great, the Russian Tsar, or Tsarina, and was then [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=488.1s)]
*  renamed as Odessa after she was inspired by Greek mythology to rename Hegibay as Odessa. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=495.7s)]
*  Odessa then became a major center, the preeminent and earliest center of Zionist thought and [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=504.73999999999995s)]
*  agitation. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=513.22s)]
*  For example, Vladimir Jabotinsky, the founder of the so-called Zionist Revisionist Movement, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=514.9s)]
*  and the key ideologue that inspires today's Israeli settler movement and the Likud party [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=521.14s)]
*  of Benjamin Netanyahu, Jabotinsky came from Odessa. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=529.78s)]
*  Of course, Havavetzion, the early Zionist settler movement, was founded in Odessa and founded the [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=534.8199999999999s)]
*  first Zionist colonies in Palestine in the 1880s and 90s. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=542.8199999999999s)]
*  So all that's to say that these kind of simplistic equations of Ukraine is Palestine and [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=548.18s)]
*  Ukrainian resistance is the same as Palestinian resistance are ones that are explicitly rejected [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=557.3s)]
*  by Ukrainian leaders from Zelensky on down and very complicated when you look at the actual [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=564.7399999999999s)]
*  history, Ukraine's intertwined history with the colonization of Palestine and the dispossession [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=572.82s)]
*  of the Palestinian people. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=580.74s)]
*  And of course, not to forget, of course, the role more recently that Ukraine played in [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=582.4200000000001s)]
*  American imperialism, Ukraine sent the third largest military contingent as part of the [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=591.0600000000001s)]
*  US-led illegal invasion of Iraq. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=599.54s)]
*  So I think all of this points to there being just such a lack of context and knowledge in so much [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=603.14s)]
*  of the discussion we see, the sort of flag-waving discussion we see that just eliminates all of [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=614.02s)]
*  this history and context. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=621.78s)]
*  And I think hampers us from really understanding how we got to this point and then what may happen [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=623.86s)]
*  as a consequence of it, both in Ukraine and globally. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=632.34s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, just here in the so-called progressive Bay Area of California, you can't go [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=641.22s)]
*  100 meters without seeing Ukrainian flags outside people's houses. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=648.8199999999999s)]
*  There's on one of the overpasses on the nearby freeway, there's this huge giant banner that says [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=655.9399999999999s)]
*  we stand with Ukraine and Slava, Ukraine, which as Asa has pointed out is actually a slogan that [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=663.54s)]
*  has fascist history and undertones. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=671.2199999999999s)]
*  People have this very knee-jerk reaction of supporting Ukraine because the corporate [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=674.5s)]
*  mainstream media has told them that this is the correct position without any questioning, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=682.02s)]
*  any context, any historical analysis at all. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=687.94s)]
*  What can you say about the way that this narrative has been pushed from this context of knowing [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=694.1800000000001s)]
*  what we know about how the media has historically treated Palestinians and the connection between [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=703.78s)]
*  Ukraine and Palestine? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=710.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think that someone on Twitter said this and I can't remember who it was, but the phrase [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=714.42s)]
*  they used stuck with me. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=722.66s)]
*  The liberal response is that they're born outraged yesterday. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=726.42s)]
*  That's the approach to every single issue that's put in front of people. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=730.98s)]
*  People who couldn't point to Ukraine on a map a few weeks ago, the only important thing is that [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=736.98s)]
*  Russia invaded and that has to shape our entire understanding and response without having any [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=743.94s)]
*  understanding of what has happened in Ukraine in the last eight years, the role of the United [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=752.5s)]
*  States in fomenting the coup in 2014 that brought neo-Nazis to power in Ukraine, neo-Nazis who [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=758.34s)]
*  dominate the Ukrainian state. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=766.4200000000001s)]
*  It's a point that I've heard you make, Asa, in other podcasts that Nazis don't need to be a [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=771.22s)]
*  majority to control the state because they control the state through fear and terror. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=778.1800000000001s)]
*  Even Zelensky, the president, cannot defy the Nazis without risking his own life. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=783.1400000000001s)]
*  They've openly threatened his life, but these Nazis like the Azov battalion, the Ida battalion, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=789.7800000000001s)]
*  C-14 and other Nazi groups that were instrumentalized and supported and used by the [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=796.98s)]
*  United States to foment the coup so that Ukraine would abandon its neutrality and [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=802.5s)]
*  move into the NATO camp. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=810.5s)]
*  And I think many people have seen, and if they haven't, they really should see, the lecture [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=812.42s)]
*  by John Mearsheimer from 2015. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=818.8199999999999s)]
*  I talked about it in an interview I did with Rania Khalek a few weeks ago that I wrote up for EI. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=822.34s)]
*  I'm sure we can link that too. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=830.98s)]
*  But Mearsheimer explained in 2015 how the crisis in Ukraine, and he says this today, he maintains [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=834.34s)]
*  this position, that the war is the fault of the United States. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=841.7s)]
*  It's an unpopular position, he says, because it's one that casts blame on the US, and who wants to [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=845.62s)]
*  do that in this atmosphere if you're trying to make a career in American media or politics. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=853.06s)]
*  But he says that really the US pushed starting in 2008 to say that Ukraine and Georgia were going [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=859.46s)]
*  to become members of NATO, not Georgia, the southern US state. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=871.62s)]
*  Georgia, the country. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=876.74s)]
*  Georgia, the country, the Caucasus. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=877.54s)]
*  Georgia, the former Soviet Republic. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=880.1s)]
*  That's remembered. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=882.66s)]
*  Georgia that was part of the Soviet Union. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=884.8199999999999s)]
*  And the point he makes is that Russia, and this is now, I hope, well known, although there are [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=886.8199999999999s)]
*  still people who deny this, a well-established history, that at the end of the Cold War in 1989, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=893.3s)]
*  1990, the explicit condition for German reunification, for the Soviet Union acquiescing [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=901.78s)]
*  to German reunification was that NATO would not expand one inch eastwards. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=909.46s)]
*  That was the terminology that was used, that was memorialized in countless diplomatic notes [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=914.98s)]
*  and records and conversations and so on. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=922.02s)]
*  And despite that, Russia absorbed, you know, it acquiesced to two waves of NATO expansion in 2004 [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=924.6600000000001s)]
*  and then again, I forget exactly what years those were. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=935.46s)]
*  But then in 2008, and those previous waves basically absorbed most of the former Warsaw Pact [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=941.14s)]
*  countries, the countries that were previously aligned with the Soviet Union, and the former [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=949.7s)]
*  Soviet Republics, the Baltic Republics of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=954.02s)]
*  And then in 2008, when NATO said that, you know, that Georgia and Ukraine would become NATO [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=960.5s)]
*  members or the door was open to them, that's when Russia really drew the red line. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=973.3000000000001s)]
*  And what Mircea predicted accurately in 2015 was that the US pushing Ukraine to expand the [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=979.38s)]
*  US, pushing Ukraine to become a NATO member and using Ukraine as basically cannon fodder in a [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=988.1s)]
*  proxy war with Russia would lead to Ukraine, in his words, getting wrecked. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=996.9s)]
*  And it was really pressure. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1003.86s)]
*  And people are very mad at Mircea for being correct. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1005.86s)]
*  But I mean, I think we should thank him. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1009.38s)]
*  I don't necessarily like these analogies because, you know, you could argue, well, Ukraine is a [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1013.1400000000001s)]
*  sovereign state and they're free to say they want to join NATO or the EU or whatever it is. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1019.62s)]
*  But NATO is also free to say, no, that would not be wise. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1027.14s)]
*  We think that NATO should be neutral. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1034.26s)]
*  Sorry, we think that Ukraine should be neutral. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1037.22s)]
*  And you can just imagine others have made this analogy. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1039.62s)]
*  What would the US response be if Mexico joined an anti-American military alliance with, say, China [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1042.7399999999998s)]
*  and started stationing, you know, missile systems on, you know, in Tijuana or in Ciudad Juarez or [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1051.62s)]
*  just across the border from the United States? [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1061.1399999999999s)]
*  We know that the Monroe Doctrine, the American Monroe Doctrine, has led to the United States [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1064.02s)]
*  invading numerous countries in the Western Hemisphere, precisely in order to maintain [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1070.98s)]
*  its sphere of influence. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1077.38s)]
*  And right now, the Solomon Islands, a country that in the Pacific that suffered horribly [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1079.46s)]
*  under British colonialism, you know, the British rule in the Solomon Islands was as brutal there [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1086.3400000000001s)]
*  as anywhere in the world, is now as an independent state, is freely negotiating a security [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1092.66s)]
*  treaty with China. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1103.14s)]
*  And Australia and New Zealand are complaining and saying, oh, this would be a threat against us. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1105.0600000000002s)]
*  I mean, how far are the Solomon Islands? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1110.66s)]
*  How far are they from Australia and New Zealand? [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1115.7s)]
*  But Australia and New Zealand, two members of the Five Eyes, so-called Five Eyes, the Anglo-imperialist [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1118.26s)]
*  alliance of the US, UK, Australia, New Zealand, and who's the other one? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1127.46s)]
*  I think I can't remember who the other eye is, but, you know, it's one of these states. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1132.1s)]
*  And Australia and New Zealand are saying this is illegitimate. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1141.62s)]
*  A deal with China would be a threat to us. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1144.98s)]
*  So we're told on the one hand that, you know, Ukraine is completely free as a sovereign [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1147.38s)]
*  state to pursue NATO membership, and Russia doesn't have a right to say a thing about it. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1152.5s)]
*  But the poor Solomon Islands isn't even allowed to negotiate a security arrangement with China [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1157.8600000000001s)]
*  without Australia and New Zealand getting up in their faces. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1164.66s)]
*  And Australia is saying, now, we have to beef up our military spending in order to, you know, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1167.78s)]
*  to meet a threat from China. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1177.94s)]
*  And I mean, this thinking is delusional. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1179.86s)]
*  I mean, the population of Australia is 25 million people. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1182.18s)]
*  The population of Shanghai is 26 million people. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1186.82s)]
*  The population of Beijing is almost the same as the population of Australia. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1191.3799999999999s)]
*  So what kind of world do these countries want to live in where everything is defined by a zero [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1196.58s)]
*  sum game all the time, and they just can't seem to get along with anyone else? [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1203.46s)]
*  So I think that's the bigger context in which I, for one, see the situation in Ukraine, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1208.4199999999998s)]
*  and which I think is going to have tremendous. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1217.1399999999999s)]
*  I mean, many people are talking about this, and obviously it's hard to predict. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1220.74s)]
*  But I do think that there is tremendous potential geopolitical fallout. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1224.74s)]
*  This is really going to reshape the world. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1232.5s)]
*  It's one of those moments like 9-11, I've said this before, that is going to reshape the world [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1236.18s)]
*  in many ways. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1242.9s)]
*  But I think this is potentially much more profound and serious even than the fallout from 9-11. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1243.54s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, these states have nuclear weapons. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1252.66s)]
*  The US, Israel, I just don't understand how people aren't more terrified at, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1257.7s)]
*  especially the liberals and the Democratic Party, pushing for more and more war. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1270.9s)]
*  Not diplomacy, not de-escalation, but more aggression and pulling us at the brink. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1277.22s)]
*  That's the remarkable thing, Nora, if you think about it, that there is no push from [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1285.54s)]
*  the so-called West for a negotiated political settlement to the problem, the long-standing [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1294.18s)]
*  problem between Russia and Ukraine. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1304.74s)]
*  This is not new. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1308.34s)]
*  This started in 2014, but before 2014, because the history in that part of the world is that [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1310.02s)]
*  these lands were part of Russia, and Ukraine is a country that is divided between a Russian-speaking [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1318.6599999999999s)]
*  population, the Ukrainian-speaking population. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1327.9399999999998s)]
*  There are divided loyalties, divided aspirations for the country. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1330.82s)]
*  In such a country, you cannot impose one vision on an entire population. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1335.38s)]
*  This is the thing that really exasperates me about all these Ukrainian flag-waving liberals, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1343.86s)]
*  is that I don't claim to be an expert in Ukraine, but I know it's obvious to anyone who's been [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1349.46s)]
*  paying attention, who just reads a bit of news about what's been happening in the country. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1356.34s)]
*  At least since 2014, there's been a civil war ongoing in the eastern part of the country. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1361.06s)]
*  A large minority of the Ukrainian population sees itself as Russian and declared their own [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1368.1s)]
*  independent republics. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1374.82s)]
*  This is what Vladimir Putin has now recognized. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1376.82s)]
*  It's a sort of convenient start to the war, to view the war as just a start in now. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1380.58s)]
*  Obviously, it's been an escalation, but this kind of head in the sand moment, it's very [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1387.3799999999999s)]
*  convenient for all these liberals who have this... [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1396.9s)]
*  I mean, it's kind of a Russiagate derangement syndrome, is the way I see it. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1400.5s)]
*  They're so obsessed by this narrative about Putin being this uniquely awful dictator, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1405.22s)]
*  and this sort of, I guess, Rachel Maddow brain syndrome of just the official enemy that you're [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1414.74s)]
*  supposed to hate all the time. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1426.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1427.78s)]
*  Reflexively, without any questioning, without any introspection, without any analysis. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1428.5s)]
*  Just take an analogy. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1434.58s)]
*  Many people will know that I have long concluded or advocated that there should be a single [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1437.9399999999998s)]
*  state in historic Palestine in which Israeli Jews and Palestinians and others live in equality, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1445.2199999999998s)]
*  in a democratic, decolonized state with restitution for all. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1452.5s)]
*  Under no circumstances would I suggest that Israeli Jews need to be forced to speak Arabic, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1460.1s)]
*  and that Hebrew should be banned, and that whatever it is. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1467.94s)]
*  That's the equivalent of what I see as this kind of extreme Ukrainian nationalism that's [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1472.74s)]
*  being promoted. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1479.7s)]
*  I believe, of course, that in the context of equality, of democracy, of decolonization, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1481.78s)]
*  of course, Hebrew should be a language that people speak in or educated in and are free [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1489.7s)]
*  to use and should have equal status for the population that speaks Hebrew. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1495.94s)]
*  And the Ukrainian government has passed laws outlawing the use of Russian language in [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1502.3400000000001s)]
*  certain public contexts. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1509.94s)]
*  As has Israel as part of its nation-state law, so-called nation-state law passed in 1918, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1511.0600000000002s)]
*  it removed the official status of Arabic. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1519.54s)]
*  That again supports Zelensky's claim. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1525.3s)]
*  It's evidence in support of Zelensky's claim that Ukraine and Israel should be identified [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1529.22s)]
*  with each other. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1534.6599999999999s)]
*  But the point is I'm not advocating anything that I don't see as relevant in the context [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1535.3799999999999s)]
*  of Palestine. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1541.06s)]
*  You can't force a single nationalist idea on a population that is so deeply divided [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1541.94s)]
*  in its view of history, in its cultural and political and national aspirations. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1551.94s)]
*  You have to find some other way. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1557.46s)]
*  And then, especially so when the brand of Ukrainian nationalism that has been aggressively [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1559.22s)]
*  promoted since 1991, when Ukraine became independent, when the Soviet Union fell apart, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1567.62s)]
*  but especially since 2014, has been the most extreme right-wing form of nationalism you [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1577.78s)]
*  can imagine. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1585.46s)]
*  And let's talk about this for a second because what we have in Ukraine, we've all seen these [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1586.5s)]
*  discussions online where people are saying the Azov battalion, this group that was part [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1594.9s)]
*  of the right-wing coup in 2014, the US-backed coup, that they're Nazis, that they use SS [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1602.8200000000002s)]
*  symbols, that they openly hero-worship Hitler and all of that stuff. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1611.6200000000001s)]
*  And you'll see people say, well, the Azov battalion is just like a couple of hundred [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1621.3s)]
*  or a couple of thousand people. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1626.6599999999999s)]
*  You can't, you know, as if just a few Nazis is okay. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1628.1799999999998s)]
*  But all right, let's take that for the sake of argument. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1632.02s)]
*  Well, it's just a few Nazis. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1634.6599999999999s)]
*  That's not the point here. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1636.58s)]
*  The point is that the nationalist cult that the Ukrainian state has nurtured since 2014 [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1638.74s)]
*  is the cult of Stepan Bandera. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1649.0600000000002s)]
*  And who was Bandera? [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1651.0600000000002s)]
*  He was a committed ideological Nazi, Western Ukrainian nationalist Nazi who openly [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1652.9s)]
*  collaborated with Hitler and the Bandarite organizations, the organization he founded, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1663.14s)]
*  the OUN, the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, were active participants in the [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1668.98s)]
*  Holocaust and the murder of thousands of Jews, of thousands of Poles. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1675.86s)]
*  And these were committed Nazis, very committed ideological Nazis who were tools of the SS. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1681.62s)]
*  And in fact, and then members of Bandera's group were directly placed under the control of the SS, [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1689.3s)]
*  were attacking Jews, carrying out the pogroms for the Nazis and all of that. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1701.06s)]
*  And then they went off and formed another group called the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1705.86s)]
*  known by its Ukrainian officials as UPA. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1711.78s)]
*  And the UPA went off and they were so brutal and savage to the Jewish population in Western Ukraine [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1715.9399999999998s)]
*  that Jews went to the Germans for protection. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1727.1399999999999s)]
*  The Nazis were protecting Jews from the UPA. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1730.58s)]
*  And today you see the UPA flag in pro-Ukrainian marches everywhere in the West, in Chicago, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1737.7s)]
*  in Toronto. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1745.46s)]
*  In fact, Chrystia Freeland, the Canadian Deputy Foreign Minister, was photographed with the UPA [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1747.3799999999999s)]
*  flag and then she posted it on Twitter herself and had to take it down. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1754.02s)]
*  And we see in Chicago, the Illinois Ukrainian Society, because there's a fairly large [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1760.1s)]
*  Ukrainian diaspora in Chicago and Illinois, they have a day to honor the UPA. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1767.3799999999999s)]
*  They have an annual commemoration to honor the UPA. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1772.34s)]
*  It's on the Ukrainian American Society, or whatever the name of the organization is that [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1775.06s)]
*  operates in Illinois. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1782.58s)]
*  And so in order to whitewash, in order to make this palatable, this present day cult of Nazis, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1786.58s)]
*  and to make it compatible with this simplistic liberal media story of the evil Russians and the [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1794.26s)]
*  good Ukrainians, you have to hide or whitewash the history. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1803.06s)]
*  And so that's what I wrote about recently, about how literally, you know, Hitler's accomplices, [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1806.8999999999999s)]
*  Stepan Bandera, whose image is all over Ukraine now, huge banners, statues in every major city, [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1814.02s)]
*  Kiev renamed its Moscow Avenue that leads to the Babi Yar Holocaust Memorial. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1822.5s)]
*  They renamed it in 2016, Stepan Bandera Avenue, by an overwhelming vote of the Kiev City Council. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1831.54s)]
*  There are statues, huge monuments to Stepan Bandera in Ternopil in the west of Ukraine, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1840.74s)]
*  in Lviv, in other cities. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1851.94s)]
*  And in order to normalize this, you have to whitewash Bandera. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1854.34s)]
*  And the piece I wrote for EI earlier this month was about how the Anti-Defamation League, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1860.74s)]
*  a premier Israel lobby group that masquerades as an organization fighting anti-Semitism, [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1871.6200000000001s)]
*  put out an article whitewashing Bandera and saying, oh, well, you know, the Banderites [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1880.26s)]
*  just made a tactical, it was just a tactical alliance with Hitler. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1887.22s)]
*  They didn't mean it. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1891.94s)]
*  They were only murdering Jews because it was tactical. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1893.54s)]
*  I mean, as if that would make a difference. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1897.7s)]
*  But of course, it wasn't just tactical. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1900.66s)]
*  These were ideologically committed Nazis. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1903.78s)]
*  And that's who the West, the so-called West, the democracy-loving West, are supporting today. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1907.22s)]
*  The political heirs of Stepan Bandera and Hitler's accomplices. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1914.58s)]
*  Let's just be clear. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1921.78s)]
*  I just want to be clear about one thing. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1922.82s)]
*  We're not saying, I'm not saying that, you know, all 40 million people in Ukraine are Nazis. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1925.1399999999999s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1930.6599999999999s)]
*  What I'm saying, what is the fact, is that the political forces sponsored by the West, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1932.58s)]
*  who today dominate the Ukrainian state, are Nazis or people who worship or, you know, [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1941.06s)]
*  have this cult of personality of Stepan Bandera. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1950.5s)]
*  It's not just a few Azov battalion people. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1953.94s)]
*  This is a cult of Hitler accomplice Stepan Bandera that is at the heart of 2022 [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1957.86s)]
*  Ukrainian ultranationalism that is being fully supported by the so-called West, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1965.8600000000001s)]
*  while they crow about democracy and human rights and apple pie and all of that stuff. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1972.1000000000001s)]
*  What do you make of the role of the president Zelensky in all of this? [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1980.5s)]
*  Because one of the things I've noticed, and I'm sure you both have noticed as well [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1984.98s)]
*  when posting on social media, especially about Ukraine and the role of Nazi groups in [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1990.26s)]
*  the Ukrainian state, having influence of power over the Ukrainian state or being able to [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=1997.14s)]
*  kind of, I mean, hold them to ransom as it were, like the Azov battalion. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2005.46s)]
*  When you post about those kind of things, I've seen quite often the really [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2011.14s)]
*  wearying response of how can Ukraine be Nazi? The president is Jewish. What do you make of that? [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2017.8600000000001s)]
*  There was a comment in Zelensky's speech to the Knesset, which kind of stood out to me. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2029.14s)]
*  It was sort of subtle, but when he opened his address, he said, [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2033.8600000000001s)]
*  the Ukrainian and Jewish communities have always been very intertwined, very close. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2038.98s)]
*  Now, considering he is both Ukrainian and Jewish, [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2044.8200000000002s)]
*  what do you make of that kind of dichotomy that he's setting out there? [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2048.18s)]
*  Well, it sort of suggests that somehow Ukrainian Jews aren't really Ukrainian. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2053.86s)]
*  It reminds me of when Donald Trump was saying to American Jews that Benjamin Netanyahu is your [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2061.62s)]
*  prime minister, that somehow Jews' loyalty is or should be to Israel. It strikes me as a somewhat [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2067.7s)]
*  anti-Semitic comment. But this talking point that, oh, well, how can Ukraine have a Nazi problem [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2074.66s)]
*  when its president is Jewish? I've seen none other than Katerina von Schnurrbein, the EU's so-called [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2083.7s)]
*  anti-Semitism coordinator, making that point on Twitter. In other words, using Zelensky's Jewish [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2091.78s)]
*  identity to whitewash the Bandera cult, to whitewash the cult of the Hitler accomplice who [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2098.82s)]
*  murdered and whose acolytes and whose supporters murdered so many Jews in Ukraine. To me, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2106.82s)]
*  that's Holocaust revisionism by the so-called anti-Semitism coordinator of the European Union, [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2115.06s)]
*  who's admonishing us day and night, never again, and we remember and don't forget, and we have to [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2122.5s)]
*  fight Holocaust revisionism. And these very same people, April is International Holocaust Remembrance [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2128.42s)]
*  Day. And these same people who are whitewashing Nazis in Ukraine and whitewashing Stefan Bandera, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2137.38s)]
*  his murderous Hitler accomplice supporters, in a couple of weeks are going to be giving us pious [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2145.86s)]
*  lectures about never again, and we have to learn the lessons from history. The mind boggles. The [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2152.9s)]
*  mind really boggles. But the claim that, oh, well, Zelensky is Jewish, so how can there be a Nazi [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2158.1s)]
*  problem in Ukraine? It's much like saying, well, Barack Obama was Black, so there's no racism in [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2167.22s)]
*  the United States. There's no white supremacists. There's no neo-Nazis. There's no police violence. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2173.78s)]
*  There's no systematic inequality. There's no new Jim Crow. There's no mass incarceration [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2180.82s)]
*  because America elected a Black man. And in fact, that was the liberal fantasy of Barack Obama. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2188.1000000000004s)]
*  That absolutely was the liberal fantasy of Barack Obama that we've redeemed ourselves and we've [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2194.5800000000004s)]
*  overcome our difficult history because we elected a Black man. But it's no more true [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2200.58s)]
*  in the United States than it is in the context of Ukraine. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2205.22s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think if the Proud Boys or the KKK were officially appointed to be [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2210.18s)]
*  a unit of the American military in the same way that the Azov Battalion has been made a unit of [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2221.94s)]
*  the Ukrainian military since 2014, by the way, that would be a next level of concern. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2227.54s)]
*  I would be very concerned about that. And you'd have to say, yeah, there's more than... [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2239.46s)]
*  Yeah, there's a Nazi problem in every Western country in a lot of ways, but in terms of there's [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2248.2599999999998s)]
*  these groups that exist and yes, sometimes they try and infiltrate police forces and the military [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2254.1s)]
*  and so forth. But the wholesale adoption of an actual Nazi group. When I first started [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2259.7s)]
*  writing about the Azov Battalion in 2018, and we wrote that, we published that article that I did [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2266.98s)]
*  about the Azov Battalion. One of our most read articles, by the way, at least in recent years. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2274.66s)]
*  Yeah, and it's getting a lot, it's coming back up at the moment quite a lot recently because of [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2280.66s)]
*  what's happening in Ukraine and how Israel was helping them with table rifles for the Azov [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2286.2599999999998s)]
*  Battalion. I put in the headline and I described them as neo-Nazi, a neo-Nazi group. But as our [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2295.46s)]
*  colleague Maureen said, Maureen Murphy said recently, there's not really anything neo about [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2304.58s)]
*  it. They're just a Nazi group because there's a continuity there. There's a continuity between, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2309.7s)]
*  as you described at the beginning of this conversation, the history of the Holocaust [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2316.4199999999996s)]
*  and Nazi groups and satellites and puppet regimes of Hitler's regime. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2322.66s)]
*  Yeah, and you know, it's just, it's so, of course, I mean, we know, and it's something we've all [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2332.98s)]
*  written and talked about a lot, the weaponization of the idea of anti-Semitism almost exclusively as [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2340.02s)]
*  a weapon against the Palestine Solidarity Movement, where even the mildest criticism of Israel [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2348.82s)]
*  will get you branded as an anti-Semite and a Nazi. Whereas the same people like the ADL, [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2356.98s)]
*  the Anti-Defamation League that allegedly exists to defend Jews against anti-Semitism, [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2364.6600000000003s)]
*  is busy whitewashing Hitler's accomplices. It's infuriating. It is infuriating. And I think this [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2371.06s)]
*  is exactly, I think you're right there, Ali. I think this gets to the heart of why we've been [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2377.62s)]
*  covering Ukraine at the electronic intervada over the past few weeks, because it gets to the [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2384.26s)]
*  heart of the hypocrisy about the weaponization of anti-Semitism. Because, you know, [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2390.5s)]
*  Loki, a British rapper who sings long live Palestine, is branded by the Israel lobby as [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2400.98s)]
*  an anti-Semite. But then literal Nazi group in the Ukraine, branded by those same pro-Israel [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2407.2200000000003s)]
*  groups to be freedom fighters defending Mariupol in eastern Ukraine, supposedly. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2414.02s)]
*  In the years I've been writing about the Israel lobby, you kind of have to get a crash course in [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2425.46s)]
*  how this works, and you have to kind of educate yourself about the true history of anti-Semitism. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2431.22s)]
*  And so we know about all these things that have happened, these terrible things that have happened [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2436.74s)]
*  to Jewish people in history. And so therefore it's astonishing, you could say perhaps not [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2441.22s)]
*  completely surprising, to see the hypocrisy here and how the reality of actual real current day [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2448.98s)]
*  anti-Semitism and racism is being kind of whitewashed by these very same groups. So it just, [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2457.2999999999997s)]
*  it just, it's the pure, to me it's kind of the pure hypocrisy, I suppose. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2465.7s)]
*  Absolutely. And I mean, all that hypocrisy is blown open now. I mean, you know, we all saw it [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2471.54s)]
*  in the first days and weeks of this war with, you know, the racist description saying, you know, [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2478.2599999999998s)]
*  Ukraine is civilized and European, unlike Iraq, unlike Afghanistan, unlike other countries that [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2486.82s)]
*  have been subjected to... It was a real masks off moment. It was a real masks off moment. And also [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2492.66s)]
*  with respect to, you know, the BDS boycott, divestment and sanctions movement, and you [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2498.2599999999998s)]
*  had that excellent podcast, a recent episode with Olivia Catley from the boycott, divestment and [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2504.8199999999997s)]
*  sanctions movement talking about just the sheer hypocrisy. Now everything, you know, Russian is [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2512.66s)]
*  being boycotted and maligned. Whereas, you know, all the excuses that were used for so many years to [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2518.98s)]
*  protect Israel against even the mildest consequences for its actions, its crimes against [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2527.86s)]
*  the Palestinians have all blown up. So it's just, it is a masks off moment. And it is a moment, [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2534.34s)]
*  I think, in many ways, you know, for me, trying to look at this in a longer historical context, [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2542.42s)]
*  where in some ways, I think that in the minds of many of the [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2549.94s)]
*  warmongers in the West, they see this as a replay of, or let's say continuation almost of World War [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2557.54s)]
*  II, that a lot of those people never forgave the Soviet Union for defeating Hitler. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2567.22s)]
*  I really think that there's something to that. Because one of the key ways that [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2573.8599999999997s)]
*  the far right in Europe whitewashes the Nazis, whitewashes Hitler's accomplices like Stepan [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2582.74s)]
*  Bandera is to say what the ADL said is that, oh, well, for Ukrainians, you know, they're seen as [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2590.74s)]
*  symbols of anti-Soviet resistance, anti-communist resistance. Who was the anti-communist resistance? [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2598.3399999999997s)]
*  They were Nazis. They were Hitler's accomplices. They were explicit about it. So it's, you know, [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2605.7s)]
*  in order to, you know, the hatred of the Soviet Union, the hatred of Russia is so strong to the [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2613.7s)]
*  point of allying with Nazis tacitly during the war to some extent in some places, but really [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2619.86s)]
*  explicitly after World War II, when the attention turned from defeating Hitler to [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2632.9s)]
*  defeating the Soviet Union. And you had that interview with Loki on his podcast recently, [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2641.2200000000003s)]
*  Asa, where you talked about really Operation Gladio, which was the, basically NATO's [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2650.0200000000004s)]
*  covert effort to create sort of a, a stay behind army. So in the case where the Soviet Union would [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2660.9s)]
*  occupy parts of Western Europe, that these so-called stay behind armies would, you know, kick into gear. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2668.58s)]
*  And these were Nazis that were sort of the people behind these stay behind armies. I want you to say [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2676.5s)]
*  something about that, maybe give a little summary, but I just want to say that the Soviet Union was [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2684.1s)]
*  a very, very strong ally of the Soviet Union, and it was a very strong ally of the Soviet Union. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2690.42s)]
*  And I just want to say about, you know, I've been thinking about why there is this receptivity [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2697.94s)]
*  to Nazism in Western Europe in the 22nd, in the 21st century. And to an extent, I think it's because [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2708.02s)]
*  it's well understood by people. The history that we're taught in, you know, in schools is that, [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2716.74s)]
*  you know, the good guys won, the Nazis were defeated, they were tried at Nuremberg and they [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2722.4199999999996s)]
*  were punished and everyone lived happily ever after. They completely disappeared. And they [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2728.1s)]
*  completely disappeared. In fact, what happened is that, you know, the West immediately took in, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2732.9799999999996s)]
*  you know, yes, there were trials of top Nazis. And in a way, those trials absolve the West, [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2743.1400000000003s)]
*  they're like provider, I don't want to say scapegoat, because those Nazis were guilty, [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2751.1400000000003s)]
*  but it was like, we've dealt with all the guilty people. And so, you know, we were free to bring in [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2756.5800000000004s)]
*  thousands, the Americans brought in thousands of Nazi scientists to, you know, the entire, [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2764.9s)]
*  it's well known now that the entire Apollo Moon program wouldn't have happened without Nazi [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2772.1s)]
*  scientists. But it's even deeper than that. In the 1960s, very few people remember this, [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2777.3s)]
*  Kurt Kiesinger, the Chancellor of West Germany. So the leader of West Germany from 1966 to 1969 [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2785.38s)]
*  had been a member of the Nazi Party. He was a senior official in the Propaganda Ministry and [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2793.06s)]
*  in the Nazi regime's foreign broadcasting who worked with Goebbels and von Ribbentrop. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2800.18s)]
*  He was the Chancellor of West Germany. I think it might have been Mark Amers, who said recently on [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2804.9s)]
*  Twitter that the famous Stanley Kubrick film, the character Dr. Strangelove in Stanley Kubrick's [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2811.62s)]
*  film, who is this sort of parody of a war mad professor who's trying to sort of warmonger [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2820.98s)]
*  war between the US and the United in the USSR, is said in that film in passing to be a former [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2829.86s)]
*  Nazi scientist. And, you know, I remember watching that probably in my teens or early 20s and, [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2837.54s)]
*  you know, thinking, oh, this is a bit over the top, but like, yeah, that's literally true. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2844.82s)]
*  That's what happened. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2851.62s)]
*  Literally true. When the Bundeswehr, the modern German army, was founded in 1955, [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2853.46s)]
*  remember the Soviets wanted Germany to be neutral, an understandable position after all the trouble [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2859.46s)]
*  that Germany had caused. The Allies, the Americans and their Allies refused. And in 1955, the West [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2866.1s)]
*  began to rearm Germany, West Germany, and founded the Bundeswehr. And the Bundeswehr was staffed by, [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2878.26s)]
*  there were hundreds, if not thousands of former Waffen-SS officers brought into the Bundeswehr, [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2886.1000000000004s)]
*  into the modern German army. So again, Nazis rehabilitated, Nazis brought back in. And I [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2893.94s)]
*  think you see this across the so-called West, certainly in the US. I mean, that, and that, [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2900.66s)]
*  I think we're living with the legacy of that today. Asa, why don't you say a little bit, [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2910.18s)]
*  just give kind of a quick summary of some of the points you made with Loki, because I thought that [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2915.62s)]
*  was just so important, that history. Yeah, I mean, it's like you say, Ali, this is a really [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2924.58s)]
*  badly understood part of our history. And I include the left in that. And this is something [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2930.66s)]
*  that I've only begun to educate myself about recently. The history is there, you can go out [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2938.2599999999998s)]
*  and read it, but as you say, it's not taught. Same in British schools. I remember being brought up in [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2944.8999999999996s)]
*  schools in South Wales when I was young. And everything, of course, it has the same [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2953.2200000000003s)]
*  educational program as England. And everything we're taught is the heroic effort of the British [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2960.02s)]
*  people to defeat the Nazis and the Blitz and bomb shelters and we'll meet again and all that kind [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2969.46s)]
*  of stuff, which is true. But there's another part of the history which is not told, which is that, [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2976.82s)]
*  first of all, especially in Britain, there's an overemphasis on Britain's role in the war, [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2985.86s)]
*  and we weren't taught about actually, it was the Soviets, it was the Red Army who did most of the [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2992.6600000000003s)]
*  fighting, or most of the dying, and that really defeated Hitler. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=2999.46s)]
*  But then there's this more, to the extent that it was ever mentioned at all, it was mentioned [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3007.7000000000003s)]
*  in passing, but then there's this more seedy side of the history that you've started to talk about [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3011.7000000000003s)]
*  there, where after the defeat of Hitler's Nazi regime, there was top elements of his regime that [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3016.34s)]
*  were brought in from the cold, so to speak. And it was also the West German intelligence. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3027.62s)]
*  So the founding chief of the West German Federal Intelligence Service, which is, you know, [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3036.2599999999998s)]
*  their equivalent of the CIA or MI6 for British viewers and listeners, was Reinhard Gelen, [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3044.98s)]
*  who was the head of the Nazi Wehrmacht, their intelligence services on the Eastern Front. So [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3053.22s)]
*  he had all this information about the Soviets, intelligence, and he had a whole network which [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3060.3399999999997s)]
*  was initially called the Gelen operation, which then went on and did many different operations [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3065.9399999999996s)]
*  for the CIA around the world. So this was what was, in many ways, we saw the continuation of [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3070.1s)]
*  Hitlerism, really, after the Second World War, and we saw these elements integrated into NATO. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3078.58s)]
*  And a big part of that, as you mentioned, was Operation Gladio. Operation Gladio was essentially [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3086.98s)]
*  a network of secret armies which were established all over Western Europe, all over Europe, really. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3094.98s)]
*  It went from Britain in the West until Turkey in the East, and it was established by the OSS, [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3104.18s)]
*  the CIA's predecessor organization, the CIA and MI6. They did a lot of the training [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3112.74s)]
*  and establishing of this really secret terrorist army. And it was, as you said, [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3121.46s)]
*  it was dominated by Nazis. In West Germany, there was former Nazis, literal Nazis from [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3127.94s)]
*  Hitler's regime, who were involved in setting up these secret cells in Italy, which is where the [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3136.02s)]
*  name Gladio came from, because each secret army had its own name, but the Italian one was called [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3142.7400000000002s)]
*  Gladio, and the Italian one was the first to be brought to light in a big way in 1990. It all came [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3149.7000000000003s)]
*  out in an investigation with the Italian government. It came out. There was public inquiry [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3155.7s)]
*  and so forth, and it was quite a big story in the European media at the time. But it was, yeah, [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3165.14s)]
*  I mean, it was essentially a secret Nazi army. In Italy, it was former Franco, it was former [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3172.2599999999998s)]
*  followers of Mussolini in Spain. Of course, for a long time, Spain was a hot spot of, [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3179.86s)]
*  under Franco, under the Franco regime until 1977, I believe it ended. It was a base, [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3188.02s)]
*  it was actually a base, and they did training there for these secret terrorist armies, [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3194.1s)]
*  and the Portuguese fascist regime as well. And what essentially happened in Spain, [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3199.1400000000003s)]
*  what ostensibly what these armies' goal was, was, as you said, what they were called, [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3208.1s)]
*  stay behind armies, and the idea that was justified internally, these were top secret, [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3215.22s)]
*  you know, this didn't come out until many years later, but the ostensible justification was that [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3220.02s)]
*  they would be stay behind armies to stay behind enemy lines in the event of an invasion into [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3225.2999999999997s)]
*  Western Europe by the USSR. But really, in reality, if you look at the studies of this, [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3231.2999999999997s)]
*  the research has been done about it by academics and experts about the gladiatorist network, [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3237.38s)]
*  is that that wasn't the real goal. The real goal was actually to target us, was really to target [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3246.1s)]
*  Western populations, was to stop the alternative from coming to power, was to stop communist [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3253.2999999999997s)]
*  parties from coming to power, essentially, basically. That's what it was about, because [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3261.7s)]
*  they wanted to organize fear, and they wanted to organize chaos and disorder. And so what happened [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3266.02s)]
*  was these undercover cells, terrorist cells, they began doing things like targeting just mass [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3271.62s)]
*  mass terror, mass bombings, basically, bombings and shootings and different kinds of things in [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3282.9s)]
*  different countries, especially in Italy. The places we know most about where it came out were [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3287.86s)]
*  in Italy and Belgium and France, to a lesser extent. All over Europe, there was atrocities [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3293.62s)]
*  that were carried out, which were actually, you hesitate to use the term, but they were literally [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3301.14s)]
*  false flags. They were false flags. We've heard a lot about false flags in recent weeks, where [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3307.06s)]
*  it was being said constantly in the Western media that Russia was going to carry out a false flag [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3314.5s)]
*  in order to trigger an invasion in Ukraine. Well, that never happened. Sometimes there is [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3320.02s)]
*  some rather bizarre conspiracy theories about false flags, but these things do exist in history. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3325.06s)]
*  The meaning of it is just basically that an attack is made and is carried out, an attack is [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3332.82s)]
*  carried out, usually a kind of terrorist style atrocity is carried out, and then is deliberately [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3340.1s)]
*  made to look like it was done by somebody else in order to incriminate them. In the case of [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3344.9s)]
*  Italy, for example, the Bologna bombing, 85 people in the early 80s were killed. 85 people in the [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3350.1s)]
*  train station in Italy were killed in this bombing that was done by the Gladio organization, which [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3360.26s)]
*  was these former followers of Mussolini and all these various Italian fascists who were carrying [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3367.86s)]
*  this out. And then it was made to look like they were organized under the auspices of [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3375.46s)]
*  Italian military intelligence. This went to the top levels. This wasn't just like our few rogue [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3382.9s)]
*  elements. This went to the very top and it was organized by NATO. So it was started by the CIA [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3388.6600000000003s)]
*  and MI6, but when then NATO officially came into existence, NATO took on the coordinating role of [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3395.14s)]
*  the Gladio organization. That meant they had access to things like Italian police could then [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3402.2599999999998s)]
*  cover things up. There was these mysterious investigations that never went anywhere and [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3411.46s)]
*  it took some things like there were some campaigning judges in Italy who were then threatened and so [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3416.18s)]
*  forth, but some of them managed to get details out about it. And it's thanks to things like that [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3421.46s)]
*  that we even know about it. I can't believe Rachel Maddow forgot to tell us about this. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3426.98s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, Gladio is wild because it sounds like something from some sort of thriller or [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3435.14s)]
*  conspiracy novel or something, but the details of it, the truth is stranger than fiction really. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3440.34s)]
*  And the goal of what they were trying to do was sort of twofold. They were trying to create fear [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3446.74s)]
*  for one thing. They were trying to create fear in the population where it was a kind of sense of [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3455.3799999999997s)]
*  chaos. In Italy it was called the strategy of tension where it made people feel like they had [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3459.8599999999997s)]
*  to turn to the government or even in some cases in some countries to kind of push for a coup, [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3465.62s)]
*  that there'd be some kind of coup by right-wing elements as we saw happen in Turkey with the [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3472.9s)]
*  military coups that we saw in Turkey and there was claims of soft coups in other countries as well [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3477.54s)]
*  like France. And secondly, it was also to incriminate the left, what was called the hard left. So there [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3486.9s)]
*  was a certain element of infiltration of far-left groups like the Red Army faction in Germany [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3495.7000000000003s)]
*  and I forget the name of the there was Italian, I think it was Red Brigade something like that, [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3502.42s)]
*  that were infiltrated by Gladio elements. And the idea was that then they were [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3509.06s)]
*  implicated in these atrocities and then that by implication was used to discredit the more [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3516.98s)]
*  mainstream communist parties in places like Italy and France and other countries in Western Europe, [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3522.34s)]
*  which don't forget were very very unlike in Britain and in the US, communist parties in [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3528.82s)]
*  those countries came very very close to power, especially in the immediate aftermath of World [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3534.5800000000004s)]
*  War II where they formed the basis of the Italian partisans, the resistance to the fascists. They [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3540.5800000000004s)]
*  came close to winning the elections after the Second World War and these kind of things. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3548.98s)]
*  They only get like 25-30 percent, that kind of thing. These were real contenders for [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3553.38s)]
*  power in these countries so it was about preventing also the left from gaining power [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3561.54s)]
*  through democratic means. Yeah absolutely. Yeah so you know and I think the last thing I want to say [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3570.6600000000003s)]
*  about Gladio is that you know there's a comment my friend Louis Alde made to me recently which is that [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3580.9s)]
*  what we're seeing now in not so much in Ukraine but here in the so-called West, in Britain and [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3588.98s)]
*  in the UK and in Western Europe, in Britain and in the US and in Western Europe with a kind of [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3598.58s)]
*  all-out media war that has been on the issue of Ukraine, it feels, what Louis said was that [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3605.46s)]
*  it feels like the victory of Gladio because the target is us, the target of this kind of [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3614.26s)]
*  war fever against Russia and the target of this kind of normalisation of Nazis that we're seeing, [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3621.7s)]
*  it feels like that we are the target of these kind of operations as much as Russia. I mean [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3631.14s)]
*  a really disturbing example of that was posted last week by a BBC journalist, [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3639.06s)]
*  you know it was a BBC video, I'm not sure if it went out on the actual BBC TV but it went out on [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3646.9s)]
*  his Twitter and it got 1.6 million views on Twitter, you know this is not a marginal thing [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3652.2599999999998s)]
*  and it was this bizarre video where the BBC journalist Ross Atkins, high production [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3659.38s)]
*  values but bizarre because it looked in depth at the Azov battalion and it was essentially [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3666.82s)]
*  sort of whitewashing them and saying well yes they have Nazis in their ranks but it's only [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3672.26s)]
*  10 to 20 percent of them that are Nazis and actually they're the best fighters so therefore [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3678.58s)]
*  you can understand why Ukraine is arming and normalising them. So this is the real disturbing [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3684.74s)]
*  thing to me that we're seeing, it's this sort of normalisation of Nazis in 2022. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3692.5s)]
*  Incredible, incredible. And I think all this war fever and the flag waving and all of this [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3700.4199999999996s)]
*  has the effect of just fogging people's vision to some of the serious geopolitical consequences [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3709.54s)]
*  to some of this which you know will be devastating to people all over the world. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3720.1s)]
*  Already there are warnings because Ukraine and Russia are the two among the biggest, Russia is [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3729.46s)]
*  the single biggest wheat exporter in the world and that's by the way a recent phenomenon. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3738.18s)]
*  You know in the 80s the USSR, the Soviet Union had to import huge amounts of grain from the United [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3745.46s)]
*  States. Now Russia is the world's biggest grain exporter followed by the United States and then [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3754.18s)]
*  Ukraine and Canada are in the top five and many countries in the world depend on, [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3764.42s)]
*  you know many countries in Africa, in Asia depend on grain from Ukraine and from these countries. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3772.26s)]
*  The energy situation in Europe, I mean this is like the Americans are so happy with this because [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3779.62s)]
*  you know the natural thing for Europeans to do is to trade with Russia. They're on the same continent, [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3788.58s)]
*  Russia has massive natural resources and Europe is, you know what is it, 40 percent of its [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3795.06s)]
*  gas comes from Russia. Well now they've said we're going to cut off all Russian gas you know within [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3804.26s)]
*  a few years, maybe sooner if they're not willing to pay in rubles, but you know we're going to and [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3810.1800000000003s)]
*  we're going to start, you know they've signed a deal that the EU has signed a deal with the United [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3816.18s)]
*  States to begin importing liquefied natural gas from the United States. First of all that's not [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3821.46s)]
*  going to happen overnight if it happens at all because the infrastructure isn't there and secondly [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3829.8599999999997s)]
*  it's a very expensive process because you have to extract the gas through you know fracking or [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3835.22s)]
*  whatever horrible processes they're using in the United States. Then you have to liquefy it which [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3843.14s)]
*  is an expensive and energy intensive process, ship it across the Atlantic in container ships [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3848.66s)]
*  and then deliquify it on the other end and distribute it. So you have to have all this [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3855.14s)]
*  infrastructure, new distribution networks, terminals etc. And you know from what I'm not an expert in [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3860.98s)]
*  this field but from some of the stuff I've read the American gas will be at least 20% more expensive [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3869.7s)]
*  than Russian gas which just comes out of the ground and then flows through a pipeline. But this makes [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3876.8199999999997s)]
*  the U.S., makes Europe even more dependent on the United States, even more dependent on NATO and [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3884.8999999999996s)]
*  Gladio and all that because Europe is cutting itself off from its natural trading partner [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3891.94s)]
*  which would be Russia. And then this is not a bad thing, you know it's a good thing or a bad thing [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3900.98s)]
*  I suppose depending on your perspective and where you sit. But the freezing of Russian reserves by [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3909.38s)]
*  the West by so-called sanctions and by the way this isn't the first time because we've seen other [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3916.66s)]
*  official enemies have their reserves frozen or stolen not least Venezuela whose assets were [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3922.5s)]
*  stolen by the United States and handed over to the U.S. appointed so-called president of [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3930.58s)]
*  Venezuela Juan Guaido but also the Bank of England which confiscated Venezuela's gold reserves. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3936.8999999999996s)]
*  And the signal that this is sending to countries all over the world is that the dollar and the euro [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3943.7799999999997s)]
*  and the British pound are not safe havens that people thought they were because you [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3951.06s)]
*  you know you put your reserves or your money in a place you think will be safe and secure [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3957.54s)]
*  and that when you need it you can pull it out and use it and what people are learning what [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3963.7s)]
*  countries are learning instead is that if you put your reserves in British or American or European [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3968.74s)]
*  banks and then you have any kind of dispute with those governments they will just steal it from you [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3976.3399999999997s)]
*  and so that the it is accelerating I think the move towards alternative forms of reserves and [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3983.8599999999997s)]
*  currencies whether it's you know gold or whether it's the Chinese currency or the ruble or whatever [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=3992.98s)]
*  it is to create more independence and to circumvent the global financial and banking systems that [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4000.34s)]
*  since World War II have been completely controlled by the West it will also probably encourage more [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4009.54s)]
*  trade that does not go through or depend on the West but let's also be very [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4017.7s)]
*  sanguine that none of this you know there's no guarantee that any of these global shifts happen [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4024.8999999999996s)]
*  smoothly and and people all over the world are likely to suffer I mean even Joe Biden said the [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4032.58s)]
*  other day there's going to be food shortages food shortages in the 21st century global food shortages [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4038.2599999999998s)]
*  what does that mean what you know what will that mean for people all over the world what will it [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4045.22s)]
*  mean in terms of political stability and unrest I mean how innocent and naive we we may have been [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4051.54s)]
*  a couple of years ago thinking oh the pandemic is a big enough challenge that it's going to bring [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4059.8599999999997s)]
*  the world together you know we're all in the same boat and we can all see you know you know all of [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4065.4599999999996s)]
*  humanity is is is vulnerable to the same threat and here we are two years later and this is the [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4071.38s)]
*  situation we're in it is in the 90s all the talk was about globalization and now we have really [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4078.9s)]
*  deglobalization happening and that's not necessarily a bad thing in many ways people are talking about a [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4089.06s)]
*  return to more local economies more regional economies more regional and sustainable supply [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4098.9s)]
*  chains and agricultural chains and all of that may ultimately prove to be a good thing but in [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4105.379999999999s)]
*  in the short and medium term you know the the risks and dangers for the world are immense and [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4111.78s)]
*  and I think it it traces back to the unwillingness of the so-called west [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4120.66s)]
*  to let go of its hegemony you know that they just want you know it's like we have to have it if we [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4127.54s)]
*  can't have it we'll smash everything up and and the view that everyone else is a threat China is a [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4133.86s)]
*  threat Russia is a threat you know anyone else rising up as a threat this Manichean zero-sum [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4140.0199999999995s)]
*  view of the world that has been so dominant in the so-called west is is just very very [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4148.42s)]
*  destructive and you know it also comes along with an alarming dose of Nazi whitewashing as well [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4156.5s)]
*  Finally let's talk about how people you know with all of this information [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4167.3s)]
*  and with this you know very American and very European tendency to divide a conflict or a [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4175.46s)]
*  divide a conflict or a situation into good versus evil you know support this guy condemn this guy [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4186.1s)]
*  you know support this guy condemn this guy when in fact of course as we know this is it's this this [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4194.42s)]
*  when in fact of course as we know this is it's this this binary sort of system is is destructive [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4199.860000000001s)]
*  and it lets hegemonic powers off the hook especially when they get to dictate which side [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4206.02s)]
*  you should choose what's what's your advice to people who um you know are trying to confidently [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4213.62s)]
*  you know analyze what's what's happening um and you know and and knowing that that that picking [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4228.18s)]
*  aside because Rachel Maddow or Joe Biden or Jen Psaki says to um may not be what you you know like [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4235.14s)]
*  what you feel in your gut is is necessarily the right thing but you want to um you know be confident [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4244.1s)]
*  about what's going how do we look at what we're seeing in the media and what's your advice to people [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4250.660000000001s)]
*  I mean what what I can say is you know as as Asa said and I can identify with this it took me a [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4258.02s)]
*  long time to unlearn a lot of the stuff I thought I knew you know I to to a great extent you know I [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4263.06s)]
*  I I was you know lived all my life in the so-called west and accepted many of the fairy [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4269.54s)]
*  tales that we were we were told and that you know I I grew up in a period when World War II was the [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4279.3s)]
*  dominant cultural narrative or phenomenon and everything was World War II movies and World War [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4286.74s)]
*  II stories and and it and and then I and there was a reason for that as well you know because [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4294.0199999999995s)]
*  there was a lot of truth in it and but and of course and so that means that you know these [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4299.78s)]
*  imperial that's the reason that these imperialist powers have used these narratives because they [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4305.62s)]
*  are so powerful and they sort of twisted them into their interests yeah absolutely of course [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4310.179999999999s)]
*  you know of course like you know it it was so easy because it was you know it was good versus [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4316.1s)]
*  evil when you look at when you look at in terms of of of the European continent and Hitler but the [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4323.860000000001s)]
*  the story we were not told and we were never taught was well you know Churchill was Hitler to [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4330.18s)]
*  to to the people of Iraq and India Britain was Hitler to the people of Africa yeah Germany was [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4336.74s)]
*  Hitler to the people of of Namibia long before Hitler was even born or when Hitler was in [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4343.7s)]
*  in diapers yeah Belgium yeah so so you know that the good after World War II [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4351.0599999999995s)]
*  after World War II when you know that the so-called good guys won the what were the [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4358.5s)]
*  French doing in Algeria what were the Dutch doing in Indonesia these these parts of the story you [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4363.46s)]
*  know if you only look at Europe you can tell a simple tale of good versus evil when you look at [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4369.38s)]
*  it from the from a more global perspective it's it's not quite such a clean picture but what I [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4377.22s)]
*  want to say is it took me a long time to unlearn some of this I you know I I think back to what I [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4386.18s)]
*  was in university at the time of the 1990-91 Gulf War when it was the same kind of propaganda it was [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4393.7s)]
*  the same kind of war fever and we've seen that again and again we saw it with Yugoslavia in the [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4400.74s)]
*  1990s with with Iraq again with Afghanistan with Libya you know catastrophe after destructive [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4407.0599999999995s)]
*  catastrophe with Syria where the west there's a lot of parallels between Ukraine and Syria [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4418.42s)]
*  yeah the moderate proxy war instead of moderate rebels we're now seeing moderate Nazis [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4424.66s)]
*  exactly so you know all that is to say that you know I don't have a magic formula but I do [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4429.9400000000005s)]
*  I do think that people have to be willing to be skeptical willing to question and I acknowledge [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4438.18s)]
*  how difficult it is in this information environment where we are being flooded and [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4446.02s)]
*  bombarded with propaganda I've never seen the media more propagandistic the BBC which which I [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4451.06s)]
*  grew up listening to and used to be you know I I don't want to romanticize it because it was always [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4458.660000000001s)]
*  you know it wasn't ever perfect but you could you could rely on it you could rely on the information [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4465.860000000001s)]
*  you know even if it was sometimes filtered through a British or a colonial prism or [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4473.06s)]
*  whatever it was people trusted the information and we listened to it for that reason particularly [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4481.14s)]
*  the world service I remember listening to the world service on shortwave during the 1991 Gulf [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4487.54s)]
*  War there was no internet at that time I was a college student in the United States and the [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4494.5s)]
*  American television was just all you know basically cheerleading for the war and propaganda so if you [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4500.02s)]
*  wanted to know what the Iraqis were saying to know what the rest of the world was saying you had to [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4506.820000000001s)]
*  listen to the BBC and the only way to do that was via shortwave I still have my little shortwave [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4513.22s)]
*  radio and I had a huge antenna I strung wires up around my room so I could get decent I had all the [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4519.06s)]
*  BBC shortwave frequencies memorized you know early in the morning you had to listen to this [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4525.94s)]
*  frequency at midday you had to listen to this frequency and so on when the weather I knew [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4531.94s)]
*  I knew what weather would give you good shortwave reception on kids don't understand the struggle [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4538.259999999999s)]
*  today these are lost skills yeah but nowadays you know the the the BBC is part of the propaganda [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4545.14s)]
*  machine in a way that I've never seen I think it's a lot more crude now you're right yeah it's a lot [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4557.54s)]
*  more it's a lot more crude it's it's and and that so where do you turn when we have a censorship on [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4562.740000000001s)]
*  social media we have the the governments and and their tech oligarchs blocking access to [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4570.5s)]
*  media that they consider disinformation it's very difficult and so you know I I just think we have to [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4579.78s)]
*  maintain our skepticism maintain our questioning continue to be willing to listen to independent [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4588.66s)]
*  media and hopefully more people come to have a more critical and thorough and in-depth understanding [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMd0p24995s&t=4595.7s)]
