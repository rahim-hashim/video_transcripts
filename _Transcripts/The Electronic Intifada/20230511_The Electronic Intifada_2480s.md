# Zionism's inevitable demise, with Ghada Karmi | EI Podcast
**The Electronic Intifada:** [May 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg)
*  In the case of Palestine, the Zionists wanted to replace the Palestinians, want to expel [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=0.0s)]
*  them. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=19.56s)]
*  They don't want them around at all, serving them or not serving. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=20.56s)]
*  The electronic intifada. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=24.96s)]
*  The electronic intifada. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=25.96s)]
*  The electronic intifada. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=26.96s)]
*  This is the electronic intifada podcast. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=27.96s)]
*  I'm Nora Barrows Friedman. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=28.96s)]
*  And I'm Asa Winstanley. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=29.96s)]
*  Welcome back to the electronic intifada podcast. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=30.96s)]
*  Today we're delighted to have author, academic and physician Ghada Karmie back on the show [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=43.2s)]
*  to talk about the 75th anniversary of the beginning of the Nakba and her new book, One [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=48.2s)]
*  State, the Only Democratic Future for Palestine Israel. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=55.08s)]
*  Karmie was born in Jerusalem and was among the 800,000 Palestinians who were forcibly [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=58.44s)]
*  expelled from Palestine in 1948. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=64.0s)]
*  Ghada Karmie's work includes books that have been instrumental in both my and Asa's early [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=66.48s)]
*  political education in search of Fatima and married to another man and her new book, I'm [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=72.16s)]
*  sure will join those earlier counterparts. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  Welcome back to the electronic intifada podcast. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=80.32s)]
*  Hello. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=83.64s)]
*  So before we get into new into your new book, which examines the one state future in Palestine, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=84.64s)]
*  we wanted to talk about the timing. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=92.64s)]
*  We're up against the 75th year of the beginning of the Nakba, the act committed by Zionists [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  of forced expulsion and ethnic cleansing of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in 1948 [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=101.08s)]
*  and Israel declared itself a state, an act that continues to this day. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=106.56s)]
*  Can you talk about your experience of the Nakba? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=112.56s)]
*  What happened to you and your family 75 years ago? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=115.28s)]
*  Well, you have to understand, first of all, that this what I'm going to say is, is my [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=120.56s)]
*  view of things as a child and as a child who also did not understand what was going on. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=131.56s)]
*  All that I knew was that as from the beginning of 1948, schools were closed. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=141.4s)]
*  My school was closed, so I couldn't go to school. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=150.12s)]
*  I was a primary school at that time. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=154.84s)]
*  But, you know, everything closed down and increasingly as the months, the early months [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=156.76s)]
*  of 1948 advanced more and more what I would call abnormalities crept into my life. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=165.88s)]
*  So it's bad enough that I didn't go to school. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=177.64s)]
*  But increasingly, we were really restricted from going out at all because there's a good [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=180.44000000000003s)]
*  reason for that. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=188.92000000000002s)]
*  Jewish snipers had taken up positions inside empty houses, that is houses whose families [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=191.48000000000002s)]
*  had already left, you know, thinking that as you do in time of troubles, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=201.0s)]
*  just to take the children away for safety. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=208.76s)]
*  Now, those houses were used by these snipers and they just took, I mean, they [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=211.64000000000001s)]
*  shot at people walking along the street. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=223.32s)]
*  So everybody scuttled in and for me as a child, it wasn't that I really understood any of this, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=226.28s)]
*  but I understood that my parents were scared. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=235.0s)]
*  And that scared me. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=238.04s)]
*  I, you know, it was an incoherent fear. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=240.68s)]
*  And so it went on getting more and more abnormal until April 1948, which is when my parents [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=245.32s)]
*  decided it was hard to evacuate us to somewhere safe while, quote, things died down, unquote. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=255.32s)]
*  And that was it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=267.4s)]
*  I never saw my homeland as it had been again. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=269.71999999999997s)]
*  I've been back, but it's not the same place. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=276.84s)]
*  So it's, yeah, it's a very shocking, very shocking, very traumatic. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=280.91999999999996s)]
*  And I really think that Palestinians should face the fact that this was a massive trauma. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=287.79999999999995s)]
*  And really, it's very difficult to recover from something like that. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=297.79999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=303.96s)]
*  Talk a little bit about your house. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=307.64s)]
*  You discovered almost 20 years ago that the New York Times was in, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=310.44s)]
*  or rather on top of, your childhood home. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=313.88s)]
*  You received a call from the Times bureau chief, Stephen Erlinger, in 2005. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=317.47999999999996s)]
*  He read your memoir, In Search of Fatima, and invited you to visit your own home. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=324.44s)]
*  Can you talk about that surreal experience and what it says about how Palestinian property [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=329.88s)]
*  and lives have been either erased as villages were razed, or up for grabs to foreign settlers [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=335.0s)]
*  and even bureau chiefs of a major news outlet? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=342.2s)]
*  That's right. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=345.88s)]
*  And now, in fact, our house had been a villa which is on one floor. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=346.68s)]
*  There was no other floor. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=352.44s)]
*  So at some subsequent point, somebody had built an upper story, and it became the New York Times [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=354.28s)]
*  bureau chief's residence in Jerusalem. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=365.0s)]
*  What a coincidence. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=368.12s)]
*  Now, Erlinger actually found my email address, don't know how, but he got in touch [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=369.64s)]
*  and he said exactly that. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=376.92s)]
*  I think I'm living above your house, etc. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=379.64s)]
*  And would you like to come and visit? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=385.0s)]
*  So I couldn't possibly have resisted because I really had to see it. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=389.88s)]
*  So I went and apart from actually going into the house, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=394.68s)]
*  the thing that really was striking was that he, Erlinger, was at pains to be nice to me [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=403.64000000000004s)]
*  and to praise my book and things like that. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=417.72s)]
*  And then to tell me that the family, Israeli family living in our house, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=423.32s)]
*  are of terribly nice people, and they really understand and they're very happy for you to [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=428.12s)]
*  look around. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=436.12s)]
*  And I remember saying to him, hang on, you now know what you do know. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=438.52s)]
*  You've read my memoir. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=446.92s)]
*  You're now living above my old house, which has different people living in it. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=448.52s)]
*  Has that changed your view of Israel at all? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=453.96s)]
*  He looked embarrassed. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=458.2s)]
*  He tried to change the subject. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=459.56s)]
*  And in my conversation with him, again and again, I came back to this point. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=461.64s)]
*  I said to him, you know what happened. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=468.28s)]
*  Why do you not say, how is it possible that it wouldn't change your view of Israel? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=473.48s)]
*  You can see you're here because I'm not here. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=483.15999999999997s)]
*  So doesn't that mean anything? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=487.96s)]
*  He was evasive to the end. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=490.52s)]
*  And I did go and look at my house, which was not our house. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=493.56s)]
*  I mean, it was dead, really. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=498.04s)]
*  All the soul in it had gone. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=500.68s)]
*  And these people were using it. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=503.15999999999997s)]
*  You know, I mean, they were nice enough. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=506.12s)]
*  I'm not saying anything else, but it was really a very sad, uncomfortable experience for me. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=508.84s)]
*  Yeah, it must have been unbearable. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=518.28s)]
*  Can only imagine. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=520.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=522.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=523.56s)]
*  The stories in your book in search of Fatima are so striking. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=527.56s)]
*  And you're left with this immense sense of loss in your memoir. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=532.04s)]
*  You know, this sort of stock facing up to the reality of a Palestine that has gone forever, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=538.2s)]
*  in a sense that, you know, even should Palestine be restored at some point in the future? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=549.32s)]
*  Well, let's be optimistic and say when Palestine is restored at some point in the future, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=557.96s)]
*  it won't be the same Palestine. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=562.52s)]
*  And there's no going back to there's no going back in time. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=563.88s)]
*  And that Palestine will, you know, in the future would be something different. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=568.2s)]
*  So, I mean, on that note, let's get into your book, your new book. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=572.84s)]
*  This here it is, One State, the only democratic future for Palestine, Israel. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=578.52s)]
*  And it's kind of an extension of an earlier book you wrote, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=585.08s)]
*  Married to Another Man on a similar topic. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=589.4s)]
*  And it's not the first book on the one state solution. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=593.48s)]
*  And our colleague Ali Abdel Nema, of course, he wrote a book about 20 years ago. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=596.92s)]
*  And he references work and the work of others extensively in your new book. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=606.28s)]
*  And you write in the introduction, quote, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=610.1999999999999s)]
*  A shared state is the only way this impasse will end, not because it is wanted by either side, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=614.28s)]
*  but because it is inevitable. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=620.12s)]
*  It is the contention of this book that the logic of the situation before us [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=622.5200000000001s)]
*  must lead to the formation of one democratic state [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=627.48s)]
*  in place of the current ethnocentric apartheid state of Israel. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=631.72s)]
*  And you add at the end, another quote, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=636.36s)]
*  Israel was created and maintained against the logic of history. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=638.84s)]
*  And the same historical logic will dictate its inevitable ending. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=643.24s)]
*  So this is all from the introduction. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=648.12s)]
*  So, Radha, tell us a bit more about why you wrote this book [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=651.0799999999999s)]
*  and what the current moment can show us in terms of this inevitability [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=657.0799999999999s)]
*  that you talk about in the introduction. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=662.68s)]
*  Well, look, my primary motivation was [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=665.9599999999999s)]
*  knowing that the 75th anniversary of Israel was coming up. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=672.04s)]
*  I actually wanted to look ahead, to look forward, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=675.72s)]
*  rather than mourn the past. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=683.08s)]
*  Of course, we mourn the past. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=684.6s)]
*  We always will. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=686.0400000000001s)]
*  But really, it's high time that we used our energies [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=687.88s)]
*  to inquire, discuss, search for the future. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=694.9200000000001s)]
*  And for me, of course, and I think for all Palestinians, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=700.92s)]
*  the future means the return of Palestine. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=704.68s)]
*  Now, how that return will happen, what it will amount to, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=710.84s)]
*  these are things that need to be addressed. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=717.24s)]
*  And that was the primary motivation for the book. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=721.64s)]
*  Now, when I said that it was inevitable, I really meant that [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=724.92s)]
*  it wasn't wishful thinking because it's in the logic of the situation [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=730.1999999999999s)]
*  that you have an oppressor who knows no other language [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=738.1999999999999s)]
*  except violence and oppression. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=743.24s)]
*  And you have an oppressed people and you can get out of the situation [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=745.88s)]
*  and you can see Israel's done quite well in so many decades [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=752.1999999999999s)]
*  where it's been able to commit all kinds of crimes [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=757.3199999999999s)]
*  and get away with it. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=764.68s)]
*  But it cannot go on forever. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=767.48s)]
*  That situation does not go on forever. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=769.7199999999999s)]
*  It never has historically. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=772.04s)]
*  So that's what I meant by inevitable. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=774.36s)]
*  Because the subject people rise up again and again, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=777.1600000000001s)]
*  ineffectively at first, but as time goes on, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=784.0400000000001s)]
*  they get more and more effective. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=787.24s)]
*  And the oppressor having no tools other than oppression [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=790.2s)]
*  will increase their oppression. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=795.72s)]
*  So that's the main reason why I said that it was inevitable. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=798.0400000000001s)]
*  And resistance by the oppressor will eventually lead to [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=803.48s)]
*  a very different and new situation. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=809.0799999999999s)]
*  And now, of course, I do not suggest that when this happens [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=812.1999999999999s)]
*  and there is a sort of chaos, I don't think I'm going to be able [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=817.56s)]
*  to do that because I'm not going to be able to do that. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=822.36s)]
*  But I think that's the way it is. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=825.56s)]
*  When this happens and there is a sort of chaos, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=827.56s)]
*  I'm not suggesting that suddenly out of this, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=832.4399999999999s)]
*  there will emerge this state quickly. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=835.3199999999999s)]
*  It won't. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=838.04s)]
*  There will be a period of bloodshed, of extreme chaos [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=840.04s)]
*  and violence, but then out of this will come the shape [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=845.2399999999999s)]
*  of the future state. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=853.64s)]
*  A state which no way can it be a state for one side entirely, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=855.8000000000001s)]
*  certainly not for Jews. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=864.84s)]
*  And where Palestinians have to, as I've said in the book, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=867.24s)]
*  they have to accept, bitter as it is for them, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=872.12s)]
*  that to live with what was the oppressor yesterday [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=876.9200000000001s)]
*  and people who have a racist attitude towards them [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=881.96s)]
*  and feel themselves to be superior, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=885.64s)]
*  it's very, very difficult to get to people who've suffered [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=887.88s)]
*  so much to say, all right, I will live with you. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=891.88s)]
*  But there is no alternative. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=895.88s)]
*  There is a Jewish community living in what was Palestine. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=898.36s)]
*  And what are you going to do with them? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=903.24s)]
*  You're not going to kill them. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=905.96s)]
*  You're not going to throw them in the sea. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=907.24s)]
*  And so of course you have to live together. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=909.64s)]
*  And I suppose what I'm suggesting, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=913.24s)]
*  which most reasonable people would suggest, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=915.1600000000001s)]
*  is the way you live together will be in a democracy [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=918.44s)]
*  where everybody is represented equally, irrespective of their origin, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=922.52s)]
*  race, gender, et cetera. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=927.64s)]
*  One of the parallels that is often made, of course, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=932.6800000000001s)]
*  is South Africa, but there are certainly similarities. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=936.28s)]
*  But what do you make of the less commonly made parallel of Algeria? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=944.12s)]
*  What do you think of the similarities there? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=953.3199999999999s)]
*  Do you see any similarities with what happened with Algeria [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=955.0s)]
*  in the sense that the French settler colonists [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=959.0799999999999s)]
*  were offered citizenship in the liberated Algeria [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=962.6s)]
*  after they won their national liberation struggle, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=966.84s)]
*  but hardly any of them chose to accept it. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=969.24s)]
*  They went back to France. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=972.44s)]
*  Yeah, actually, it's very interesting that, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=975.0s)]
*  because you see, I do see a parallel. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=977.32s)]
*  And I'll tell you what it is. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=979.16s)]
*  First of all, don't forget that the French have a mother country. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=981.48s)]
*  They do. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=986.28s)]
*  And so when the Algerians made that very extremely generous [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=987.1600000000001s)]
*  offer, they knew that nobody was going to end up stateless. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=992.44s)]
*  They would go back to France or wherever, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=998.92s)]
*  because they were French, they were still French. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1001.72s)]
*  So that's one difference, let's say, between our situation in Israel. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1005.0s)]
*  But where I see the similarity is that a large number of these French colonists [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1012.28s)]
*  who had been, well, the settlers, really, decided to go to leave, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1021.72s)]
*  to leave and to go and find their lives elsewhere. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1028.68s)]
*  Their colonial privilege was more important to them. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1032.28s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1035.48s)]
*  But this is exactly the point of similarity with the situation in Israel, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1036.28s)]
*  because what you have are people who have grown accustomed to enjoying [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1042.4399999999998s)]
*  all the advantages of colonialism without the cost. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1053.3999999999999s)]
*  I mean, wonderful. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1057.56s)]
*  Where else are they going to get that? [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1059.0s)]
*  Now, when the Arabs, as they call them, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1060.84s)]
*  come along and say, OK, let's live together in equality, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1066.84s)]
*  it's anathema to many of people like this on the Jewish side. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1071.0800000000002s)]
*  Anathema. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1076.92s)]
*  They despise Arabs. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1078.28s)]
*  They look down on them. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1080.68s)]
*  The idea that they would live with them in equality is absolutely abhorrent. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1082.04s)]
*  They would leave. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1087.4s)]
*  That's my point. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1088.6000000000001s)]
*  We were not asking for anybody to leave, but that is what would in effect happen. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1090.68s)]
*  People with dual nationality will try and make their way back to Western countries, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1095.6399999999999s)]
*  and that will leave behind, as I've explained in the book, a population of poor Jews, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1103.08s)]
*  religious Jews, and hardy souls who refuse to accept what's happening [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1112.2s)]
*  and hang on in the hope that it will change. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1120.9199999999998s)]
*  That's what I think will happen. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1123.3999999999999s)]
*  The two-state solution, meanwhile, is still paraded about by Western leaders as a way to kick the can down the road, continue the status quo. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1125.56s)]
*  How can you assess its popularity by civil society at this point in time, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1138.04s)]
*  and what will it take for this charade to finally be put to rest? [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1143.1599999999999s)]
*  Yes, thank you for asking that. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1149.08s)]
*  That's a very important and interesting question. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1151.08s)]
*  You see, you have to ask what's really going on when a political solution was proposed decades ago [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1155.8799999999999s)]
*  and got nowhere on the ground. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1168.04s)]
*  But on the contrary, the conditions for its realization have vanished [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1171.48s)]
*  because there's not enough land left. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1177.56s)]
*  The land is not contiguous. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1180.2s)]
*  Even on those grounds alone, it's not doable. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1183.0s)]
*  However, as you say, people cling to it, particularly Western leaderships, Western politicians. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1187.8s)]
*  They cling to this for dear life. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1197.8s)]
*  Now, what is that about? [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1201.48s)]
*  Well, I think it's about firstly, it's easier for these people rather than confronting it. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1203.0s)]
*  What they've helped create in the Middle East, a state like Israel, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1213.3200000000002s)]
*  rather than confront that and understand that that has consequences. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1218.6000000000001s)]
*  You see, if you go on talking about two states, then the aggrieved party, the Palestinians, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1223.88s)]
*  gets something and would be induced to keep quiet. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1230.52s)]
*  Israel can carry on as usual, although in a smaller geographical space, let's say. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1237.08s)]
*  So that's very, very attractive, the idea of that. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1244.68s)]
*  And that's what actually made it so popular from the beginning, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1247.48s)]
*  that you could preserve this Zionist state and at the same time, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1250.52s)]
*  do something for the Palestinians so that they would stop getting together and [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1259.0s)]
*  doing intifadas and all these nasty things. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1265.8s)]
*  So I think really that's what it was. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1268.28s)]
*  However, I do feel there's something deeper than that because you have to ask, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1272.6s)]
*  all right, well, if that's fine for the reasons I've just said, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1282.6s)]
*  you Western politicians, you want it, you support the two states, fine. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1287.96s)]
*  Now, I'm demonstrating to you that it cannot physically happen. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1292.84s)]
*  Just like, you know, you might say, I would like to have a Rolls Royce. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1296.6s)]
*  And the answer comes back after a while, you're dreaming of this Rolls Royce. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1301.56s)]
*  And the answer comes back, no, not available. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1305.9599999999998s)]
*  They don't make them anymore. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1309.56s)]
*  And you go on saying, I'm, but I tell you, I want a Rolls Royce. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1312.1999999999998s)]
*  Now, what's that about? [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1317.3999999999999s)]
*  God promised me a Rolls Royce, right. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1318.52s)]
*  That's right. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1322.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1323.24s)]
*  But you see, I really think there's something psychological at the bottom of this. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1325.08s)]
*  And I think Palestinians have to wise up because something that is that Westerns, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1331.32s)]
*  Westerners cling to like this, despite the evidence, against the evidence, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1338.6799999999998s)]
*  despite the injustice, all that stuff. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1344.76s)]
*  What I think, and of course, it's a suspicion, I can't prove it. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1348.36s)]
*  Is that deep inside, a lot of Europeans and Americans is an abiding sense of guilt about [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1352.68s)]
*  the Jews. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1367.72s)]
*  Now that's because of course, the culmination of that was in the Holocaust, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1369.0800000000002s)]
*  but it was before in the historic persecution of Jews. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1373.8s)]
*  That remains deeply inside a lot of people and they feel badly about Jews. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1378.6s)]
*  And they feel that the Jews, the least you can do is help them to live in their state, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1386.52s)]
*  make sure that they are safe. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1394.12s)]
*  I really cannot think of any other than this explanation. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1396.52s)]
*  You can see that if something, I mean, they're not conscious of this. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1400.44s)]
*  I'm not suggesting for a moment they're going around thinking this, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1403.56s)]
*  but that's what I think animates this very strange phenomenon. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1406.68s)]
*  You talk a lot in your book. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1414.8400000000001s)]
*  The longest chapter really is about a kind of history of different plans for Palestine, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1419.16s)]
*  different plans of what's often called the one state solution. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1427.4s)]
*  And you also talk about the bi-national state and how, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1432.92s)]
*  I found the section quite interesting where you're talking about some of the early Zionists [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1436.76s)]
*  wanted to have a bi-national state within Palestine as a way really of having a [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1442.2s)]
*  foothold for their colonial project really. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1449.24s)]
*  There's also something called parallel sovereignty. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1454.2s)]
*  And you're not, you write in your book that you're not trying to make a blueprint, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1457.72s)]
*  but could you maybe talk a little bit about the evolution of the one state idea [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1462.52s)]
*  and its history and where do you think we've got to now? [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1468.52s)]
*  Well, as you say, that chapter was, I felt it was very important for people to understand how these [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1473.16s)]
*  ideas have evolved. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1481.8s)]
*  And they really have, I would say in the last 20 years, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1484.28s)]
*  the idea of a democratic state, a one person, one vote state has acquired much more prominence. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1488.2s)]
*  It's not, unfortunately, it's not taken hold of opinion formers, of [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1497.56s)]
*  leaderships in the West as it should have done. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1508.04s)]
*  And that again, just I refer to my earlier answer about the two states, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1512.2s)]
*  because of this deep guilt that's an issue, then should you have a one democratic state, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1516.92s)]
*  that's the end of Israel, actually. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1523.24s)]
*  That is something that there is a kind of a revulsion against. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1526.28s)]
*  Anyway, despite that, despite that, the discussion of the one state, democratic state, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1530.28s)]
*  has increased over the last 20 years, as a number of groups have come into being, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1540.3600000000001s)]
*  trying to make it happen. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1548.6000000000001s)]
*  And increasingly so, you know, but so really, that's, that I think is what is how it's happened. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1551.16s)]
*  By national state does not solve this problem. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1563.16s)]
*  Because, first of all, the implication that you've got to the idea is that you've got two [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1566.28s)]
*  equivalent nations, as it were with equivalent rights. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1573.16s)]
*  And each community or each nation, and looks after itself, and is sort of autonomous, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1579.0s)]
*  with a kind of joint parliament for defense or things like that. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1589.24s)]
*  It won't work, you see, it's not desirable. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1594.3600000000001s)]
*  I tell you why, because the other the national, the Israel national state, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1597.0800000000002s)]
*  the half of this by national by nationalism, will be Zionist. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1604.76s)]
*  I mean, you hope there's no escaping from the fact that Zionist Zionism has to end. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1611.16s)]
*  It's yeah, and it's by national state would also be sectarian, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1617.72s)]
*  it would be a sectarian state. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1622.28s)]
*  And, you know, we see the problems inherent in such an idea in a country like Lebanon, especially. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1623.72s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1629.8799999999999s)]
*  And in fact, when I've, you know, been through, I've described various models of [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1630.84s)]
*  countries that have different communities in Belgium is a very good example. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1637.72s)]
*  The fact is, if you're lucky, people can tolerate it and get on. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1644.12s)]
*  But more often than not, the whole thing breaks down. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1649.32s)]
*  Now, in the case of Palestine, which has no equivalent, in my view, it has no precedent, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1652.92s)]
*  it has no equivalent. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1659.48s)]
*  It's really unique. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1661.0s)]
*  We are discovering as we go along, and we're, you know, searching for a way out of this [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1663.24s)]
*  hideous tragedy. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1671.08s)]
*  Tragedy. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1674.2s)]
*  So there's a limit, what I'm going to say is there's a limit to how much one can apply [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1676.1200000000001s)]
*  other models. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1682.1200000000001s)]
*  And you quite rightly raised the question of South Africa. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1683.8000000000002s)]
*  And of course, one of the most important reasons why the situation in South Africa and in [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1687.0s)]
*  Palestine are fundamentally different is that the South African, the Afrikaners, the people [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1695.0s)]
*  who practiced apartheid, they wanted to exploit the Blacks, to use them for all kinds of lowly [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1703.88s)]
*  paid, laboring, etc., all these jobs. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1714.04s)]
*  In the case of Palestine, the Zionists wanted to replace the Palestinians, want to expel them. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1718.68s)]
*  They don't want them around at all, serving them or not serving them. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1729.56s)]
*  So that's a very, very fundamental difference. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1734.28s)]
*  LBZ, who decry the current outwardly fascistic government in Israel, you know, mourning the loss [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1736.76s)]
*  of, in quotations, Israel's soul, which of course has always been a deranged fantasy. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1752.76s)]
*  They say that the BDS movement, the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement, is worthless, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1759.16s)]
*  that international solidarity movements are hopeless, and that the only actors who can bring [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1763.72s)]
*  so-called peace and security, of course, for Israel, are international governments and courts [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1768.52s)]
*  and the powerful elite. What's missing from that equation? And how important are solidarity [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1774.52s)]
*  movements and the Boycott movement and, you know, people who take direct action to stop Israel's [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1781.96s)]
*  crimes? [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1789.8s)]
*  Well, let me answer the last bit of your points. It's very, the BDS movement, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1790.2s)]
*  the solidarity movement for Palestine, direct action, whichever way people feel that they can [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1801.8s)]
*  express this, is very valuable, is very important for the Palestinians. The problem with the liberal [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1809.0800000000002s)]
*  Zionists is that they don't actually, whatever they say, they don't care about Palestinians. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1815.32s)]
*  They like to appear civilized and humane and, you know, we don't want to oppress anybody. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1826.28s)]
*  But actually, if they thought about who Palestinians are and what they've been through, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1834.04s)]
*  they could not adhere to the policies of a state which created all of that and which perpetuates [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1840.84s)]
*  it. So whether they're liberal and they appreciate art or something, it is really irrelevant for the [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1850.12s)]
*  Palestinians. It's quite useless. And in a way, you know, I have to tell you, liberal Zionists are a [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1858.76s)]
*  menace. They are a menace because they perpetuate this false presentation of Israel as some kind of [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1865.72s)]
*  civilized place, which, you know, appeals to Western liberal sensibilities who think, well, [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1875.56s)]
*  these are really nice people actually and the state is quite nice, but they call it bad government, [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1885.88s)]
*  for example. And you hear this a lot. So they really are a menace. In a way, I have to say to [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1891.72s)]
*  you that Smotrich and et al are a breath of fresh air. They're more honest. Absolutely. The mask is [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1899.24s)]
*  off. Exactly. Yeah, they're saying the quiet part out loud. Right. Right. It's incredible. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1908.2s)]
*  What do you see as the role of the so-called international community in terms of the single [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1917.96s)]
*  state inevitability? I'm afraid that the international community circle has been [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1925.0s)]
*  extremely disappointing where the Palestinians are concerned. Every time Israel commits a crime, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1932.92s)]
*  and many of these crimes have been massive against an innocent population, the international [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1941.4s)]
*  community is absent. It does nothing. It doesn't matter what it says. It just doesn't do anything. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1948.3600000000001s)]
*  And you see, I came to the conclusion that Palestinians, in order to have a future, [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1959.48s)]
*  have to do away with these illusions. There is no international community as far as they're concerned. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1968.92s)]
*  There is no Western government which cares a hang about them, and therefore they're on their own. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1975.32s)]
*  And they've very often relied on international law, on the United Nations, [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1985.3999999999999s)]
*  the various sections of the United Nations. But it's never changed anything. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=1996.52s)]
*  Things just go on getting worse. So that's why I feel very strongly they have to take matters into [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2003.72s)]
*  their own hands. And if they do, it'll make a real difference. It's the only thing that will. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2011.56s)]
*  So finally, what are the obstacles to the One State solution, and do you think it can happen within our lifetime? [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2019.1599999999999s)]
*  Well, if one looks at the book, I have talked about one possible route to the One State, [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2029.24s)]
*  and that is through a Palestinian demand for equal rights. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2041.16s)]
*  Now, if you think about that, that's actually not only important, but could be very effective. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2049.8s)]
*  Currently, the one territory, the territory between the river and the sea, is One State. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2057.48s)]
*  Israel rules it. Now, about half of the people it rules are Jews, and the other half are Palestinians. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2065.32s)]
*  So it is already a population which has a significant split down the middle. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2075.56s)]
*  Now, I have argued that if the Palestinian half, which is the one without rights, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2085.24s)]
*  without state, it's stateless, without nationality, that half should demand equal rights with the rest [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2091.8s)]
*  of the citizens that Israel rules. To my mind, that is the first step. It's comprehensible. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2103.5600000000004s)]
*  It's not difficult to support. There are precedents for equal rights in recent Western history. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2111.4s)]
*  There's nothing bizarre about a demand like that, and nobody is attacking anybody. This is not [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2121.48s)]
*  violent. It's asking that if it's making the point that if you, Israel, or any other power, [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2129.32s)]
*  is ruling a people, you cannot do that without giving them any rights whatsoever, which is what's [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2138.1200000000003s)]
*  happening. Now, I feel quite strongly that if the Palestinians really set up a big campaign demanding [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2145.48s)]
*  equal rights, Israel has to react one way or the other. It has to ignore it, or it has to [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2158.04s)]
*  get more, well, it has to become more repressive, and the whole thing is out in the open. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2167.8s)]
*  So I really feel something like that has to happen. Unfortunately, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2173.32s)]
*  your question is very good, Esa, because unfortunately, I don't have confidence that [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2179.8s)]
*  Palestinians will want to do this for the reasons we said before. They don't want to live with these [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2187.32s)]
*  oppressors. They really don't. This is a very big problem. So what will happen? Well, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2194.36s)]
*  as I described in my book, and as I said earlier, there's a logic to this. Whatever you might want [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2202.04s)]
*  as Israel, and whatever the Palestinians might imagine that they can get, it won't happen like [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2209.4s)]
*  it will only happen when there has been sufficient social unrest [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2219.64s)]
*  amongst Palestinians. This is a very powerful weapon, because quite a few of them are living [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2230.9199999999996s)]
*  inside Israel, and the rest are living just literally at where it is part of the old [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2236.44s)]
*  Palestine. So they're not far away. I'm talking about them. I'm not talking about people like me. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2241.8799999999997s)]
*  They, if they all rose up as they did in 2021, if you remember, May 2021, very significant, [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2247.32s)]
*  very significant 11 days, in my opinion, they rose up together. This was really very striking. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2256.52s)]
*  In 1948, in the West Bank and Gaza, in East Jerusalem, and us outside, this is really something. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2265.08s)]
*  And that's going to happen again. Yeah, it was kind of unprecedented. I mean, it's not completely [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2275.64s)]
*  unprecedented for the whole of Palestine to rise up together. But I mean, I can't think of a similar [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2280.6s)]
*  moment really, since 1936, really, when it was the whole of Palestine unified like that, in the same [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2286.92s)]
*  way. I mean, yes, during the Second Faradah, there was some protests within 1948 territory. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2295.72s)]
*  And they were brutally repressed. There were Palestinians inside present day Israel who were [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2303.88s)]
*  killed for protesting in solidarity with the Palestinians in West Bank and Gaza. But yeah, [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2310.44s)]
*  your final chapter in the book is on that and the significance of that, sort of what some people [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2315.56s)]
*  called the unity into Faradah kind of uprising all together. And it broke down, really broke down the [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2321.32s)]
*  barriers imposed by Israel in that way. Yep. And I think that's going to happen again, [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2328.04s)]
*  and we'll gain momentum. Because that's that is the way things work out. Once people have risen, [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2334.6s)]
*  and the cause for their for their uprising remains the same, or actually gets worse, [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2343.16s)]
*  and they're not all the conditions there again. And so it will be like that. Now, when you say, [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2350.7599999999998s)]
*  will it be in our lives? I have to tell you, I really, really want it to happen in our lives. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2358.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, I'll here's a personal conclusion. I cannot bear the idea of going to my grave [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2367.08s)]
*  with this horrendous injustice thriving and the state of Israel, the apartheid, ethnic cleansing [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2375.7200000000003s)]
*  state of Israel, and it's right, you know, prospering. I can't, I can't either I'm never [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2387.08s)]
*  going to die, or that the the situation will have to change drastically. And but seriously speaking, [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2395.4s)]
*  I do not think it will be very long. I really don't because situations like this are unstable. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2402.84s)]
*  And they will erupt again and again. And each eruption has an effect. So it's a bit like that, [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2410.92s)]
*  really. That a carby. Thank you so much for all of the work that you do. Your new book is brilliant [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-AIkkjdfg&t=2420.28s)]
