# A look inside Jenin's guerrilla resistance tactics with Abdaljawad Omar & Jon Elmer | EI Podcast
**The Electronic Intifada:** [July 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0)
*  I think that it's important to say that the people in Janine don't call it a massacre, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=0.0s)]
*  they call it a battle. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=15.16s)]
*  It's the battle of Janine and it's a significant source of pride within the militant movements. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=16.16s)]
*  The Electronic Intifada. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=24.96s)]

*  This is the Electronic Intifada Podcast. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=27.96s)]
*  I'm Nora Beros-Freedman. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=28.96s)]
*  And I'm Asa Winstanley. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=29.96s)]
*  Welcome back to the Electronic Intifada Podcast. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=30.96s)]
*  As we reported, Israel withdrew its troops from Janine refugee camp on July 5th after [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=43.08s)]
*  a two-day offensive, the largest in the occupied West Bank in two decades. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  At least 13 Palestinians, including four children, were killed during the incursion. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=53.6s)]
*  The official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that more than 140 people were injured [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=59.120000000000005s)]
*  during the invasion, 20 of them critically. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=65.0s)]
*  On July 3rd, thousands of residents fled during the aerial and ground assault, which wreaked [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=68.16s)]
*  widespread destruction in the camp, rebuilt after much of it was raised during a massacre [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=73.78s)]
*  perpetrated by the Israeli military in 2002. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=78.46000000000001s)]
*  They were taking a deep dive into the context around what happened in Janine and what the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=82.68s)]
*  Palestinian resistance fighters were able to achieve in defense of their community. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=86.8s)]
*  Joining us are two friends of the EI podcast, Abdeljawad Omar, a lecturer in the philosophy [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=92.2s)]
*  and cultural studies department at Palestine's Birzeit University, and John Elmer, a journalist [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=97.2s)]
*  and researcher. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=102.8s)]
*  He also co-hosts the Brief Podcast with me. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=103.8s)]
*  He spent years as a reporter inside Palestine covering the situation in Janine and in Gaza [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=106.82s)]
*  in the early years of the Second Intifada. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=112.2s)]
*  Welcome back both of you to the Electronic Intifada Podcast. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=114.68s)]
*  Thanks for having us. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=118.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=119.72s)]
*  Abdeljawad, let's start with you. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=120.72s)]
*  This came after a series of settler pogroms across the occupied West Bank assisted by [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=123.34s)]
*  the Israeli army who are settlers in uniforms. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=128.14s)]
*  Can you situate this latest rampage in Janine for us? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=132.42000000000002s)]
*  What it's been like on the ground in Palestine over the last few weeks? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=135.96s)]
*  Well, I mean, the ground assault comes in a very or a highly politicized moment within [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=141.04s)]
*  Israel itself. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=147.23999999999998s)]
*  The settlers are pushing for a wide scale military invasion of the Virginia refugee [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=149.95999999999998s)]
*  camp and they're in the government. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=154.72s)]
*  So there's a very political or there's a very political dimension to why this operation [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=157.68s)]
*  can happen now, at least from the perspective of internal Israeli dynamics and antagonisms. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=163.72s)]
*  But it also has to do with the filling out and the containment of the Lion Den's movement [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=170.72s)]
*  in Nablus, which was the major concern for Israelis in the past couple of months. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=177.44s)]
*  Nablus as you know, we've spoken about this, I think before, but Nablus is in the crossroad [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=184.56s)]
*  of much of the settlements in the north of the West Bank and therefore it poses more [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=189.04s)]
*  of a risk for the everyday life of settlers. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=193.84s)]
*  And the Israeli military and special forces and intelligence were more focused on what's [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=196.56s)]
*  going on in Nablus rather than Janine. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=203.4s)]
*  Janine is relatively a free zone from settlements. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=206.2s)]
*  It has some settlements, but they're far away from the center of Janine itself or the refugee [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=210.48s)]
*  camp, which means that Nablus was the major concern for Israeli security establishment. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=215.0s)]
*  And after a lot of pressure, they were able at least to prevent the establishment of a [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=225.56s)]
*  self-defense zone in the old city of Nablus in the likes of what's happening in Janine [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=230.8s)]
*  or the Janine refugee camp to be more precise. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=235.92000000000002s)]
*  So yeah, this is the context. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=240.08s)]
*  This is why it's happening now. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=241.08s)]
*  And even the programs that you spoke about actually were part of the settlements pressure [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=243.16s)]
*  on the government to place more military pressure on the Palestinians and to engage in more [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=248.12s)]
*  wide assault on the Palestinian society, including with Janine. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=253.44s)]
*  So I mean, that's the basic context of what was happening at this moment. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=256.48s)]
*  And John, you were in Janine in 2002. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=264.0s)]
*  Tell us about that massacre and the resistance operations that fighters engaged in. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=267.68s)]
*  Why it matters to talk about what happened 21 years ago in order to understand what happened [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=272.0s)]
*  this past week, this past month, especially as Abdul-jawad said in Nablus as well. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=277.44s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think Janine has been a focal point of resistance for the entire history [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=284.2s)]
*  of the Israel-Palestine conflict going back to the Arab revolt. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=290.52s)]
*  Isidin Al-Qassam was based out of Janine during the Arab revolt. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=293.76s)]
*  The people that live in Janine, the Janine refugee camp, are all exiles from 1948, living [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=298.48s)]
*  in a half a square kilometer, densely populated area in the north of the West Bank. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=308.72s)]
*  It's an agricultural city, the green city, city of greenery. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=315.52000000000004s)]
*  And it has a history of resistance. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=321.56s)]
*  And that resistance came to the fore in particularly in the second Intifada, as many militants [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  were the basis of the uprising in many ways was in Janine and dispatched fighters throughout [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=330.64s)]
*  Israel during the campaign of suicide bombings that were extremely effective against the [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=341.72s)]
*  Israelis. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=348.28000000000003s)]
*  In 2002, the Israelis mounted an operation to retake the West Bank Operation Defensive [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=348.96s)]
*  Shield. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=357.64s)]
*  It wasn't just Janine. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=358.12s)]
*  It was also, of course, pretty famously in the old city of Nablus. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=359.96s)]
*  But what happened to the Israeli army in Janine in 2002 is the kind of thing that, you know, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=365.4s)]
*  songs are written about and people will talk about for generations to come because [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=371.76s)]
*  instead of fighting or lobbing artillery or dropping bombs from the air, the Israelis [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=379.12s)]
*  actually attempted to go into the Janine refugee camp. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=385.35999999999996s)]
*  And that had been previously a no-go territory. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=388.71999999999997s)]
*  And so the fact that they showed up on the ground ready to fight was something that [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=394.32s)]
*  Palestinians had always kind of asked for, right, like a fair fight. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=399.59999999999997s)]
*  Don't just drop bombs from the sky. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=403.84s)]
*  Come in and fight us. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=405.64s)]
*  And when they did, basically the death toll was one to one for Israeli and IDF fighters. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=407.48s)]
*  Most famously, the IDF was drawn into an ambush by a teenager in an alleyway and 13 [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=414.08000000000004s)]
*  Israeli soldiers were killed at once. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=423.0s)]
*  And it was a spectacular ambush. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=425.16s)]
*  And it was being watched on live feed by the Israeli military command. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=428.32s)]
*  And so when they watched the humiliation happening, basically all the commanders were [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=434.92s)]
*  there and urged an intensification of the of the attack on Janine. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=441.08000000000004s)]
*  And that's basically what introduced the world to the D9 Caterpillar Bulldozer, where [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=449.6s)]
*  basically Israel had to lead their fighters, had to be led by these massive bulldozers, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=454.84000000000003s)]
*  armored bulldozers, and they basically wiped out, like erased the middle of the camp in [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=462.56s)]
*  Janine after that. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=469.6s)]
*  And there was some talk by the PA after that it was a massacre because people believed [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=472.2s)]
*  that that these houses were dropped on top of fighters and on top of people. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=477.96s)]
*  But as it turned out, the fighters were mostly many of them were able to escape and people [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=484.2s)]
*  were able to move around because it's their own community, their own land, their own [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=491.32s)]
*  territory. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=496.0s)]
*  Civilians, as well as fighters, were able to move around and move out of the way. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=498.24s)]
*  Some people talk about being in houses with 200, 300 people in a house because everybody [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=503.6s)]
*  moved from one house to the next. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=509.92s)]
*  But that kind of control or territorial control by the Palestinians really set the Israelis [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=512.6s)]
*  back at that time. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=524.32s)]
*  The like I said, the death toll one to one in a guerrilla battle with a superior armed [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=526.72s)]
*  force is significant. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=535.28s)]
*  And so I think that it's important to say that the people in Janine don't call it a [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=536.76s)]
*  massacre. They call it a battle. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=541.84s)]
*  It's the Battle of Janine and it's a significant source of pride within the militant [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=543.48s)]
*  movements. And whenever these kind of incidents come up where Israel goes into Janine, of [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=549.1600000000001s)]
*  course, everybody talks about it. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=556.36s)]
*  The fighters are, you know, have that esprit de corps in them from that moment. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=558.76s)]
*  And 2002 in the Janine camp was a real turning point for the Palestinian resistance. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=565.2s)]
*  Yeah, well, on that, let's talk about Israel's military objectives such as they were and [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=572.2s)]
*  why the Palestinian armed factions are saying now that Israel's operation in Janine in the [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=579.8000000000001s)]
*  refugee camp was a failure. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=586.9200000000001s)]
*  The Israeli defense minister, Yoav Galant, told military reporters that the army had [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=589.24s)]
*  fully achieved its objectives. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=594.44s)]
*  He said that an explosive workshop was destroyed and the military secured the ability for [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=597.6400000000001s)]
*  occupation forces to move through the camp during future operations. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=603.24s)]
*  Our colleague Maureen Murphy wrote that, quote, keen to present the invasion as a [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=609.8000000000001s)]
*  tactical success. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=615.32s)]
*  The military and Shin Bet, Israel's domestic intelligence agency, said that thousands of [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=616.9200000000001s)]
*  weapons, including ammunition and materials for making explosives, were confiscated during [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=622.32s)]
*  the operation. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=628.4000000000001s)]
*  Israel estimates there to be some 300 fighters in Janine refugee camp. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=630.6400000000001s)]
*  But during the raid, its forces only seized 10 IEDs, improvised explosive devices, 24 [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=635.72s)]
*  rifles and eight handguns. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=643.7600000000001s)]
*  So, yeah, this is according to their account, suggesting that the military didn't make as [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=645.1600000000001s)]
*  big of an indent in the resistance's capacity as its spokesperson claimed. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=650.28s)]
*  That's what our colleague Maureen wrote. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=654.68s)]
*  John, first of all, and then maybe Abdul-Jawad, you can chime in. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=657.8s)]
*  Can you talk about the status of the Janine brigades and their military capabilities and [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=664.12s)]
*  what this says about Israel's objectives? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=669.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, if we if we draw this back, right, the increasing activity in Janine goes [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=672.76s)]
*  back a couple of years now. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=679.24s)]
*  But even if we just look at the past couple of weeks to a month, there was a series of [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=681.16s)]
*  raids that were thwarted by the Janine brigades by intelligence, counterintelligence [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=686.52s)]
*  that saw Mr. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=692.92s)]
*  Avim, like death squads dressed as Palestinian civilians coming in in, you know, various [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=694.76s)]
*  types of vehicles, milk trucks in one case, and they were exposed and the shootout, they [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=701.6s)]
*  weren't able to enter the camp to carry out their operations. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=707.24s)]
*  And then last week or two weeks ago, maybe it was if we remember, they went into the [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=710.72s)]
*  camp with a bunch of armored vehicles and those armored vehicles were dismantled, blown [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=715.6s)]
*  up by roadside bombs and then sort of famously dragged like towed through the city by [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=720.6800000000001s)]
*  other Israeli armored vehicles. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=727.6800000000001s)]
*  And those kind of symbols are really potent when I was. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=729.72s)]
*  Yeah, that was a real sort of Keystone Cops moment, to be honest. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=733.72s)]
*  You know, there was this massive armored vehicle that was really immobilized and was just [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=737.68s)]
*  sitting there prone for a long. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=742.4s)]
*  I mean, you can see in the videos for long period on fire. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=745.16s)]
*  Yeah, on fire. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=747.64s)]
*  Well, there was multiple shots like that. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=749.2s)]
*  Yeah. And then the vehicles they've blown up several as many as seven different vehicles [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=751.4399999999999s)]
*  were hit by bombs and parts of the vehicles were all over Janine. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=759.0s)]
*  The kids were going around carrying wheelbarrows with carrying trailers with all of the [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=763.44s)]
*  parts. And Israel kind of famously never leaves any more. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=768.36s)]
*  They used to never leaves their vehicles behind. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=773.1600000000001s)]
*  So when I was in South Lebanon after the 2006 July War, the Lebanese, the first thing that [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=776.32s)]
*  they would always say is because you could tell on the hillside how far the tanks had [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=783.8000000000001s)]
*  made it up the hill and then disabled and then dragged back down the hill by other tanks. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=788.4s)]
*  And you could see the tracks dug in the ground. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=794.1999999999999s)]
*  And of all the kind of stories to tell about the war, people were always that was always [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=797.12s)]
*  kind of the first one that they would laugh at because the spectacle of it to watch these [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=801.56s)]
*  disabled vehicles be dragged through town, that that was to my mind, of course, the as [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=806.28s)]
*  Abdul-Jawad said, the beginning, the settler pressure on an operation in Janine has been [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=814.28s)]
*  significant. But this kind of humiliation of watching their vehicles be dragged through [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=821.24s)]
*  town is that's the kind of thing as it was in 2002 that spurs the sort of call to action [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=827.76s)]
*  to being humiliated by the resistance. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=835.72s)]
*  And, you know, the those weapons tallies that you read, I didn't see those guns. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=837.68s)]
*  They had the IDF put out multiple videos of like guns on the table kind of thing after a [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=844.56s)]
*  raid that you see. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=850.88s)]
*  And they didn't even have receivers like the triggers weren't there for the guns. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=852.8s)]
*  It was it was barrel stocks, butt stocks. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=856.8s)]
*  It was like wires. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=860.2399999999999s)]
*  And then there was like, so it sounds like it wasn't even weapons. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=861.88s)]
*  It was weapons parts, weapons parts. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=864.4799999999999s)]
*  And then a box of pipe bombs, which are made in kitchens, right. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=867.16s)]
*  Our Palestinians make them in their kitchen. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=871.12s)]
*  So it's like you see on the one hand that they didn't capture the actual weapons that are in [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=872.9599999999999s)]
*  Janine, which are significant. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=878.4s)]
*  And we can talk about that, why that is later when we talk about the P.A. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=880.0799999999999s)]
*  But they clearly didn't get those guns. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=884.4s)]
*  But then on the other hand, they're showing you that basically this is a pure guerrilla [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=887.12s)]
*  movement building their own weapons to fight for their own refugee camp. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=892.2s)]
*  And if you look at those two and put them together, it's difficult to see how you could [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=896.6400000000001s)]
*  call that a successful operation. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=901.88s)]
*  It is true that they did go deeper into the camp than they have in 20 years. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=903.9200000000001s)]
*  And they did need bulldozers to to pave to dig up the roads on the way in to do that. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=909.6s)]
*  So in some senses, they were able to do that. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=917.8000000000001s)]
*  And that's what they're bragging about, because for all the last two years, when they [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=920.4s)]
*  talked about operations in the Janine refugee camp, they weren't in the camp. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=924.4s)]
*  They were on the outskirts of the camp, you know, like where Shireen was shot, was on [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=928.9599999999999s)]
*  the outskirts of the camp. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=933.8s)]
*  They weren't able to actually penetrate the camp. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=935.52s)]
*  So in this sense, they did that. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=938.28s)]
*  But they came under fierce resistance. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=941.0799999999999s)]
*  People talked about the roadside bombs being significant, well-placed. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=944.56s)]
*  The Israelis were unable to have freedom of movement in the way that they wanted. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=948.76s)]
*  Everything had to be they were protected and moved extremely slowly. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=953.64s)]
*  In the 2002 war, they were moving 50 meters a day. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=959.64s)]
*  That's how long it took to penetrate through the resistance lines. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=965.0s)]
*  Abdul, what do you make of the Janine Brigade's military capabilities and the claimed [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=969.96s)]
*  military successes of the Israelis in this particular invasion? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=977.36s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think I do agree with John almost completely in the sense of there's [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=982.04s)]
*  a big, big over exaggeration of these tactical successes. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=989.84s)]
*  Like I can't like emphasize this more. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=995.08s)]
*  And I'll talk about why even in terms of the movement of the army itself, because the [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=999.12s)]
*  army, when it entered Janine refugee camp, was actually avoiding close combat with the [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1003.56s)]
*  resistance fighters. So they wanted a battle or they wanted a penetration of the camp [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1009.76s)]
*  without a battle, which meant using or utilizing air force. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1015.1199999999999s)]
*  It meant also using the sniping power that they have using grenades. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1018.4s)]
*  But they wanted from a distance and they were always avoidant of any form of engagement [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1024.12s)]
*  in close to close or, you know, combat that is very close, very intimate between you and [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1029.48s)]
*  the resistance. And the resistance itself also played it well because it actually avoided [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1036.24s)]
*  clashes from a distance in large. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1041.04s)]
*  So it actually waited this out. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1042.72s)]
*  It did not engage when it was not necessary to engage and only engaged when the Israeli [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1045.44s)]
*  military entered in certain specific points within the camp and when the Israelis were [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1050.8s)]
*  withdrawing, which was like the weaker point of their whole operation, which actually led to the [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1056.48s)]
*  killing of one soldier eventually. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1061.28s)]
*  So you had the situation where Israel was basically utilizing remote control warfare while [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1063.56s)]
*  also touting its infantry entering the camp. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1070.16s)]
*  So that's one element. And the second element, what John said, which is the D9 and it's trying to take out [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1075.96s)]
*  all forms of IEDs through taking out the whole streets so they can actually enter and [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1080.08s)]
*  penetrate the camp. And the third component is that what tactical success is. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1086.6799999999998s)]
*  I mean, capturing some parts of weapons or, I don't know, reaching out. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1093.4399999999998s)]
*  I'm not trying to say that there's no relative success. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1098.52s)]
*  There's always relative success in the sense that you've entered, you know more about the [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1100.6399999999999s)]
*  resistance, its capabilities, you have more intelligence, you can redesign your operations. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1104.32s)]
*  There's a lot of stuff that goes into this. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1108.96s)]
*  And I'm not saying anything like that, but you touted, you placed one thousand soldiers in what is [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1111.08s)]
*  supposed to be a two day campaign to retain authority over the camp. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1116.88s)]
*  And you basically failed. And not only you failed, you actually provided another spectacle of [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1123.1200000000001s)]
*  humiliation in the eyes of the Palestinian people. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1128.84s)]
*  So because most people have read this as a success for the Janine Brigades, as a success for [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1131.76s)]
*  the military resistance of the camp, as a success for this sovereign space that is now also a [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1138.68s)]
*  haven for a lot of the Palestinians who are wanted from other parts of the West Bank, who have [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1142.4s)]
*  conducted operations, who go for the refugee camp to get cover and to get safety from Israeli [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1146.76s)]
*  arrests or assassinations. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1153.16s)]
*  So in many ways, I think this is the start of a new chapter in the military engagement. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1155.1200000000001s)]
*  I'm not saying this is the end of it, but I think at least at this critical point and juncture, I [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1160.5600000000002s)]
*  think the Israelis are over exaggerating their successes. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1165.96s)]
*  The second element, I'm just going to speak very fast on it, is that the way that actually we [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1170.24s)]
*  designed their objectives from the beginning, it was very, very kind of ambivalent, no, because in [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1175.0800000000002s)]
*  the start of the campaign, it was one thing as it rolled. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1180.72s)]
*  It was another thing. At the start of the campaign, it was the capturing of resistance fighters, the [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1183.0800000000002s)]
*  killing of the resistance fighters. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1187.2s)]
*  Slowly, it moves into these small tactical gains. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1188.96s)]
*  Slowly, they try to reframe it through the idea of spokesperson in different elements and [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1192.24s)]
*  different lights and trying to present it as some big success. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1198.28s)]
*  Even Netanyahu went to the, I think, Salem cross point, if I'm not wrong, or the checkpoint, or he [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1202.72s)]
*  was close to the operation taking pictures. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1208.0s)]
*  So in many ways, I think that you can see how the Israeli military tried to navigate the changing of [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1210.36s)]
*  their objectives as the battle continued and as they were sitting there as, you know, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1217.64s)]
*  fatigued, tired, nothing much to do and not able to really truly engage in the resistance in the [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1224.8400000000001s)]
*  heart of the camp itself. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1231.68s)]
*  So I think in many ways you had, yeah, you had a new symbol of victory again without many casualties [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1233.3600000000001s)]
*  on the Palestinian side or the resistance side. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1240.16s)]
*  And with a lot of success in terms of the resistance in maintaining the capacity to resist and the [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1242.56s)]
*  capacity to engage with the Israeli military. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1249.1599999999999s)]
*  And I think this is even different than 2002 for me. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1251.56s)]
*  Like John talked a lot about the experience in 2002. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1255.56s)]
*  It's a bit different in a sense of the use and utilization of the IEDs, the ability to engage the [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1259.04s)]
*  Israeli military at specific points where the Israeli military is stretched out or is in a weak [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1269.16s)]
*  position. The avoidance of battle when it's not necessary. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1275.52s)]
*  So there's a lot of these elements that is going on, I think, within the camp, which shows some sort [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1279.16s)]
*  of tactical maturity on the part of the resistance and the brigades that I don't want to like [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1285.96s)]
*  over exaggerate it, but I think it does exist and we can see it in terms of their performance in the [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1290.88s)]
*  battle in the past two days. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1296.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1297.6000000000001s)]
*  John, did you have anything to add to that? [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1300.0s)]
*  No, I think that's right. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1304.44s)]
*  And I think one of the things that's important to note is that people talk about this being a new [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1307.1200000000001s)]
*  generation of resistance fighters. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1312.52s)]
*  It's important to note that the last generation of resistance fighters were assassinated. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1314.5600000000002s)]
*  They were jailed. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1320.88s)]
*  They were, you know, the assassination campaign in Janine alone ran 20, 25 deep in each [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1322.8s)]
*  organization, wiping out the top leadership. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1329.2s)]
*  The top leadership of the fighters, as it appears on the ground in Janine right now, are in their late [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1332.6s)]
*  teens and early 20s. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1339.68s)]
*  So if this is a new generation of fighters, they're already multiple years in their short lives into [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1342.0s)]
*  learning these lessons that were passed down from their from their brothers and from the previous [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1349.4s)]
*  fights. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1356.68s)]
*  Let's take a look at the Palestinian Authority. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1359.16s)]
*  Last time we had Yuan Abdeljawad in February, you talked about the PAs ongoing and entrenching role [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1362.2s)]
*  as a subcontractor of Israel's settler colonial project this past week. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1368.5600000000002s)]
*  In Janine, we saw the PA abandon Palestinians, just as it did during the recent settler pogroms [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1372.96s)]
*  elsewhere in the occupied West Bank. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1378.56s)]
*  Tell us about the legitimacy of the PA at this point. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1380.8s)]
*  And, you know, of course, Asa wrote a couple of days ago, a piece in which he quoted Netanyahu [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1385.12s)]
*  saying, we need the PA, it does our job for us, et cetera. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1391.84s)]
*  So what can you make of the PA's role at this point? [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1396.6s)]
*  I mean, I don't think the PA is only abandoning the camps or abandoning the protection of the [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1400.76s)]
*  Palestinian people. I think it's deeper than that. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1406.24s)]
*  It's an active, at least in parts of it, it's an active participant in the counterinsurgency [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1408.48s)]
*  campaign. So this is at least we need to like place that firmly because it's not simply not doing [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1414.96s)]
*  anything. It's actually doing a lot. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1421.32s)]
*  That's on the one hand, when it comes to the internal antagonism, we saw a breakdown in the refugee [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1424.24s)]
*  camp, in the funerals of the martyrs when some of the leaders attempted to come and speak [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1429.48s)]
*  and pay condolences to the people. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1436.32s)]
*  But they were met with screams of people. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1438.56s)]
*  They were shut down and they were kicked out from the funerals. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1441.72s)]
*  So it already tells you what legitimacy. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1444.88s)]
*  I don't think that there's a legitimacy in the eyes of the vast majority of the Palestinians when it [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1448.16s)]
*  comes to the current leadership. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1453.56s)]
*  Now, the danger of this, as I say it, is that the Israelis are also saying the same thing. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1455.64s)]
*  They're placing the onus of blame, at least the HSPARA, the pro-Zionist, on this breakdown of [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1461.12s)]
*  legitimacy in the PA, but they don't see how they feed into it. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1469.72s)]
*  They don't see how they are part of the process of delegitimizing the PA, historically speaking, by [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1473.48s)]
*  not engaging in negotiations, currently speaking, by pushing the PA to be more active in [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1479.6799999999998s)]
*  counter-insurgency. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1486.32s)]
*  So the PA is under these two pressures, a societal pressure to protect, a societal pressure to also, [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1487.84s)]
*  if you want, actually abandon, not do anything, just stay there, not being active, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1493.36s)]
*  intelligence gathering, not spreading rumors, not trying to buy out fighters, not trying to arrest or [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1500.44s)]
*  attempting to arrest some of these fighters. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1505.8s)]
*  So a lot of the people are just telling them, just sit in your own garrisons and don't do anything, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1507.76s)]
*  please. No, don't harm us. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1513.56s)]
*  But at the same time, the PA leadership is under pressure to create this internal antagonism within [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1516.0s)]
*  Palestinian society, because one of the successes of, let's say, the counter-insurgency campaign is not [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1522.56s)]
*  only the military tactical battle that we spoke about, it's not only the resistance, its ability to [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1526.8s)]
*  sustain its capacity for resistance over time. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1532.1999999999998s)]
*  But I think what is very central is this political fight happening within the Palestinian society. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1535.08s)]
*  And in that sense, the Israelis want some sort of, want the internal antagonisms within Palestinian [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1541.16s)]
*  society to surface and become even more, more violent, taking away the pressure from the [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1548.68s)]
*  enmity towards Israel and directing it towards enmity within, between the PA and the resistance [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1558.3600000000001s)]
*  fighters. Unfortunately, that's part of the process that we're seeing. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1564.2800000000002s)]
*  That's part of how things are rolling. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1567.4s)]
*  There's still a lot of consciousness around avoiding any form of internal fights, elites in terms [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1569.04s)]
*  of gun battles or fighting. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1577.8400000000001s)]
*  But I think this is the situation of the PA when it comes to dealing with the resistance in Jinnin [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1580.8s)]
*  and also the larger or wider Palestinian society. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1586.76s)]
*  So, yeah. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1590.04s)]
*  And, John, you had mentioned earlier the relationship between the PA and the availability of [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1590.44s)]
*  weapons. Can you talk a little bit about that, explain that further? [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1598.72s)]
*  Yeah, well, Jinnin's a different case than most of the West Bank. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1604.3200000000002s)]
*  It's not part of the Dayton, the Keith Dayton army that's set up to create the Palestinian [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1607.72s)]
*  security force. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1613.44s)]
*  In a lot of cases, the PA fighters in Jinnin are the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades who were [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1614.84s)]
*  demobilized in a deal in the, like, what was it, like early 2010s that included a lot of [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1621.04s)]
*  people from the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades that basically, yeah, didn't believe themselves to [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1629.68s)]
*  be as openly part of the counterinsurgency war as the sort of like Keith Dayton's, like, new [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1639.2s)]
*  men, as he called them. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1645.6399999999999s)]
*  It was more of a traditional demobilization of an armed group and an integration into the [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1648.0s)]
*  security force. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1653.8s)]
*  So historically in Jinnin, that the access to weapons from the PA, particularly at the [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1655.44s)]
*  beginning of the Second Intifada, played a critical role in the uprising. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1662.36s)]
*  The PA played two critical roles in that, by originally sharing their weapons if they [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1667.72s)]
*  weren't going to fight and then, of course, later releasing the people that, the fighters [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1672.6s)]
*  that Arafat had in jail that were significant elements of the Second Intifada, the Islamic [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1678.36s)]
*  Jihad fighters, the Qassam fighters. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1683.76s)]
*  And so Jinnin is complicated in the way that they treat the PA. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1687.68s)]
*  The PA security forces attack the PA political forces and burn their offices in Jinnin. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1691.16s)]
*  When Arafat and Saib Arakat came to visit Jinnin after the 2002 invasion, their helicopter [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1698.6000000000001s)]
*  was shot at. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1706.3200000000002s)]
*  They were basically chased out. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1707.28s)]
*  So that resistance is deep. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1710.0s)]
*  And the PA, you know, they were chanted out of the demonstrations in the, or chanted out [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1713.1200000000001s)]
*  of the funerals, but they've been even stronger against the PA in that area. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1719.68s)]
*  It was a no-go zone for Arafat. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1726.1200000000001s)]
*  And so, yeah, the fact that the weapons of the Second Intifada were in significant [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1729.24s)]
*  measure, like were recalled by Barghouti and spread out through the fighters, people that [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1738.44s)]
*  if you didn't want to fight, if you were PA, you had a weapon, you didn't want to fight, you turned [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1745.48s)]
*  your weapon in and they redistributed their weapon, which is one of the reasons why Israel [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1749.64s)]
*  destroyed the Palestinian Authority in the early, in the early Second Intifada. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1754.68s)]
*  That was their first targets was all their police stations and all their barracks and [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1760.28s)]
*  whatnot. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1765.72s)]
*  So, yeah, it creates an interesting dynamic in Jinnin because of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1767.08s)]
*  who were, who are a small but significant portion of the armed rebellion in 2002. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1773.24s)]
*  Part of it, Kourn Sakaria Zabedi was, you know, one of the leaders of the resistance [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1780.84s)]
*  and he demobilized and him and a number of his members demobilized. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1788.68s)]
*  They later reneged on that, of course, and then he was part of the, that prison break, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1794.28s)]
*  the spoon and tunnel prison break. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1799.56s)]
*  But yeah, the PA, I mean, for just for listeners, of course, I'm sure if they're [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1802.76s)]
*  listeners of this podcast, that they know that the PA hasn't held elections in 20 years because [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1808.6000000000001s)]
*  they're not allowed to have elections because they'll lose. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1814.2s)]
*  And so they basically have been banned by the international community with scare quotes, you [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1818.44s)]
*  know, from running elections. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1823.64s)]
*  But yeah, that demobilization of the fighters was an interesting thing because I think [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1826.76s)]
*  that there's at least a part of the anger of the stepping aside was the belief that their PA [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1831.96s)]
*  security forces weren't as deep collaborators. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1842.2s)]
*  I don't know if we're nuancing this too much, but that they weren't as deep collaborators [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1847.24s)]
*  as other elements of the PA security forces, which actually attempt to go into certain [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1852.1200000000001s)]
*  cities in the West Bank and take weapons from fighters. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1858.3600000000001s)]
*  That does not happen in Janine. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1861.64s)]
*  If anything, there's the argument would be made that the PA provided some sort of security like [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1863.64s)]
*  Netanyahu was asking for, which actually makes smuggling easier, actually makes hiding fighters, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1868.76s)]
*  like Abdul-Jawad said, from elsewhere in the West Bank come to Janine to hide out. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1875.16s)]
*  Though for a resistance group to have that capacity to have almost like a safe haven [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1881.48s)]
*  is a critical element. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1888.1200000000001s)]
*  So it's a complicated matter, but there's no question that the PA has no legitimacy anywhere. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1890.44s)]
*  The only minor nuance that you would put on it in Janine is the demobilization of the fighters [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1897.64s)]
*  and the use of the weapons of the PA in the second Intifada. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1903.56s)]
*  And you can see just in the fighters, like in their jihadi videos, in their promotional videos, [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1909.24s)]
*  you can see them all standing with their weaponry. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1915.88s)]
*  They all have the most updated weaponry. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1918.6s)]
*  There was a lot of weapons in the Janine camp, and if 8 or 12, or what I saw was none, were taken, [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1924.52s)]
*  then there's still a lot of weapons in Janine and the success of the operation. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1931.48s)]
*  If it further alienated the PA, if they didn't capture the guns, if their fighters [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1938.28s)]
*  understand how hard the fight is, if they do ever actually attempt to go into the camp, [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1944.92s)]
*  it's difficult to see those as any kind of a success. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1949.88s)]
*  And Netanyahu even said that the military may need to return to Janine. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1957.96s)]
*  Many people have been saying that this was one of the operations that are known as like [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1966.8400000000001s)]
*  mowing the lawn, which they do in Gaza repeatedly. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1971.56s)]
*  What do you think the next operation could look like in Janine, and how do you think [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1978.68s)]
*  the brigades inside the refugee camp especially would change their tactics, if at all? [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1987.32s)]
*  The question is for me? [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=1997.3200000000002s)]
*  So in essence, I think the Israelis have two options, either to do more of the same, [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2001.8s)]
*  which is what they've done right now, which is a large-scale military operation like the one [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2010.1200000000001s)]
*  before, but this time they would actually be willing to choke the resistance, go to close [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2015.3200000000002s)]
*  combat, risk being killed in battle, risk being trapped in an ambush like what happened 20 years [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2023.0s)]
*  ago, which is something that actually hovers around the design of this operation. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2036.36s)]
*  Also, Israelis remember this as a painful memory, and that's why they're also avoidant of the battle [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2042.44s)]
*  itself. So they have this option, they have the option of using air power, which is you direct [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2049.0s)]
*  your firepower without risking anything from a distance. It needs accurate intelligence, it needs [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2055.56s)]
*  a sense of where any fighter is at any moment, it needs that type of engagement. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2064.28s)]
*  Or the third option that has been on the ground in the past two years was the special forces [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2071.7200000000003s)]
*  the small units that come in, they surround a specific cell, they kill this cell, but then you [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2078.92s)]
*  have like a small backup of infantry coming in and also supporting this operation, what John explained [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2084.6800000000003s)]
*  a bit earlier. So these are the three major options. I'm not sure what the Israelis will choose [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2092.76s)]
*  in terms of how they will operate, and I'm not sure how the resistance will actually react, [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2099.16s)]
*  but I do think that the people learning the lesson of the current battle, of the current engagement [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2104.7599999999998s)]
*  would be significant for both sides of who can actually maintain this capacity of resistance. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2116.52s)]
*  But I think one of the basic elements of what's happening is also that now resistance, at least [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2121.16s)]
*  in Janine, is becoming a much more attractive enterprise for a lot of young Palestinians. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2127.96s)]
*  Every success that the resistance has, it can regenerate this hope among the new generation, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2137.56s)]
*  but also older generations, and can actually increase its recruits, includes and expand its [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2143.8s)]
*  presence, whether it's in the refugee camp or in the Janine area, because we have to mention that [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2150.28s)]
*  we're focusing a lot about the Janine refugee camp, but it's also important to place the Janine [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2156.76s)]
*  rural areas and the Janine city as part of what's happening in the refugee camp, because a lot of [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2164.76s)]
*  the fighters are also from the surrounding areas and have a good relationship with the people within [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2170.5200000000004s)]
*  the camp, so there's this give and take between the rural areas of Janine and the Janine refugee [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2175.8s)]
*  camp. Janine refugee camp is the place where people basically are concentrated, condensed, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2180.5200000000004s)]
*  where you can have a self-defense zone where the fighters primarily may be turned to in the case [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2185.72s)]
*  of invasion, or they spread out. I'm not sure, I don't really have any kind of ground analysis on [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2191.48s)]
*  this specific part, what they do actually in terms of the invasion, but at least in many instances, [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2196.9199999999996s)]
*  this is not only an enterprise within the camp, it also engulfs the whole rural areas and Janine [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2203.64s)]
*  city as well, because I think just one last point, I basically went off-ramp, but one last [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2210.52s)]
*  point, I think there's no legitimacy for the PA, that's true, but the PA currently holds one [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2220.2s)]
*  component of power, ideological power, which is the sense of loss that people are investing in [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2231.32s)]
*  sustaining. What I mean by it is that the Palestinian people in many cases don't have a very [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2237.4s)]
*  clear picture of what an alternative to the PA economically and socially would be, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2246.36s)]
*  and that's what sustains it. It's the lack of alternative, it's this dystopic image of what [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2251.4s)]
*  would happen if the PA breaks down, specifically in terms of the middle class and the upper classes [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2256.28s)]
*  in the West Bank, which are fearful of this kind of situation. So the PA has this power of saying, [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2262.2s)]
*  we're the only ones in town, we're the only ones that can provide you with economic security, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2268.7599999999998s)]
*  we're the only ones that can provide you with a sense of economic grounding to relieve some [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2273.16s)]
*  of the anxiety of being under a settler colonial regime, in a sense of this economic persistence, [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2279.08s)]
*  and that's a very, of course, self-destructive position in the long term, and it might lead [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2285.72s)]
*  to the Palestinian people paying the price in the medium run or the long run, [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2295.16s)]
*  specifically in the West Bank, but it's one that is still pertinent to what's going on in the West [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2300.12s)]
*  Bank right now. So the resistance and its success in Janine, what it's doing, it's kind of shattering [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2306.4399999999996s)]
*  this kind of narrative, this melancholic, this defeatist narrative. It's kind of saying, [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2312.68s)]
*  we can do it. Look at these ways. They even fear to engage us. If the battle is not 100% guaranteed [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2320.44s)]
*  to not result in a soldier's death, we're not going to engage on it. They're not as strong as [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2330.52s)]
*  you believe that they are, and we're here, and we're going to stay here, and we're powerful, [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2335.48s)]
*  and we're building, and we're creating, and we're experimenting with new methods and tactics, [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2342.6s)]
*  and we're going to continue to do that, and we're going to maintain our capacity to resist, [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2348.04s)]
*  and that's, I think, the basic, important political message that the resistance is sending, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2352.2s)]
*  despite its playing with death and martyrdom, that it's actually a message of hope. So that's [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2356.92s)]
*  my take, at least, also on that dynamic, and that's one of the important, at least, outcomes of [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2363.8s)]
*  the battle of Janine, the current one. Yeah, I think that's really important. I mean, I think [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2369.48s)]
*  that's really the main reason for the successes of Palestinian armed resistance, is that it is [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2374.52s)]
*  completely counter to the narrative in the West, that it's a sort of cult of death and all this [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2383.08s)]
*  kind of stuff, that it is a message of hope. I think that's a really good way to put it, that [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2388.12s)]
*  people are hoping for freedom. I mean, that's what it comes down to, you know. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2395.56s)]
*  The fighters are extremely popular. There's no other way to say it, and for people who don't [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2401.7999999999997s)]
*  have the experience on the ground seeing it, the depth of it is remarkable, from house to house, [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2407.0s)]
*  the support, the ability for the fighters to move from house to house. I mean, you just saw little [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2415.56s)]
*  things like when the fighters moved from house to house and ate the food in one of the houses, [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2420.52s)]
*  and they leave apology notes. The celebration after people come out of their house immediately, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2426.52s)]
*  all generations, all ages, all factions, this idea, people always kind of talk about Palestine [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2435.96s)]
*  as really factionalized. In Janine, that's not the case at all. The fighters fight under the same [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2444.2s)]
*  banner. As we said, we've been calling them the Janine Brigades. They're Islamic Jihad, Qasam, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2449.16s)]
*  Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades. They're not sectarian in that nature when it comes to the organization [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2455.4s)]
*  of the fight, and the popularity and endurance of the popularity for resistance tactics of all types [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2463.08s)]
*  is deep in Palestinian society. So these aren't people on the fringes carrying out [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2471.48s)]
*  violent action when other people are saying we should be marching in the streets or having [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2478.76s)]
*  peaceful demonstrations. Everybody in Palestine understands that the peaceful demonstrations end [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2485.64s)]
*  up as massacres, and that they need the resistance to make their community safe, to make it hard for [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2490.68s)]
*  Israeli armor to come rolling down your street and traumatize your children and destroy your [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2499.4s)]
*  infrastructure and take your jobs and turn off your water and your electricity, shut the bakeries, [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2505.7200000000003s)]
*  encircle the town. All of these things are real, tangible living experiences that people have, [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2514.36s)]
*  and the resistance, as Abdul-Jawad said, offers hope. But not hope in a utopian way, [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2521.72s)]
*  hope in a practical, like yesterday they were coming here with death squads, and nobody in [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2531.64s)]
*  Janine thinks the death squad's coming tonight. Those are victories within the population as well. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2537.72s)]
*  They're tangible things that make it harder for the Israelis to destroy Palestinian [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2546.84s)]
*  ways of life in all various ways. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2553.7200000000003s)]
*  I agree, and I just wanted to also like, I think, yeah, it is this desire, this deep desire of [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2558.36s)]
*  freedom, but you know, a fighter, you know, he turns towards death, you know, because [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2565.08s)]
*  most fighters, when they start fighting, they know they're ultimately doomed men in most cases, [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2570.1200000000003s)]
*  no? They're either going to prison or they're, you know, going to be martyred. But they're also, [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2576.6000000000004s)]
*  in this resistance, this is the position of the resistance now in Janine and Nablus and other [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2582.04s)]
*  places, is that we know that we're doomed, we turn toward death, and we don't like death. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2585.88s)]
*  We're going to expand as much as possible our life as people who are turning towards death, [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2594.8399999999997s)]
*  and that's what provides them with this power within Palestinian society, [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2602.2s)]
*  because at the one hand, they're not afraid of that. They're not afraid of the Israeli [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2606.12s)]
*  intelligence officer threatening them. They're not afraid of the Israeli military coming in, [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2610.7599999999998s)]
*  and they're not afraid of death itself, but they're trying to expand their life in this [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2616.7599999999998s)]
*  liminal zone, if you want to call it, you know, and engaging with the military and being serious [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2621.32s)]
*  about it. So this is not a tragic battle, no? Like, they're not trying to be the tragic hero, [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2626.1200000000003s)]
*  the one who fights a losing battle, but yet, you know, fights it. They're actually trying to build, [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2632.52s)]
*  you know, successful tactics. They're trying to maneuver with whatever capacity they have, [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2638.44s)]

*  this capacity to resist and trying to maintain it and not only maintain it to actually expand on it, [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2659.96s)]
*  and that's what makes it significant, is that there's a deep desire here for an actual military [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2665.8s)]
*  battle that enables a symbolic protocol success and that message of hope to actually truly spread, [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2672.6s)]
*  because the military battle is the condition for that message of hope. Without it, there's no [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2681.08s)]
*  message of hope. The success itself is the message of hope. So yeah, that's what I just wanted to say. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzq-uSXIff0&t=2686.6s)]
