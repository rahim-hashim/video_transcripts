Video Description: A new briefing paper maps the historical and political context for the current criminalization of solidarity activism and organizing against Israel‚Äôs genocide in Gaza. 
Palestine liberation activism has been ‚Äúlike a laboratory, a canary in a coal mine,‚Äù academic and researcher Darryl Li told The Electronic Intifada Podcast.
Li is an Associate Professor of Anthropology and Social Sciences and a Lecturer in Law at the University of Chicago.
He is a lead author of the paper, ‚ÄúAnti-Palestinian at the Core: The Origins and Growing Dangers of US Antiterrorism Law,‚Äù which was co-published by the Center for Constitutional Rights and Palestine Legal.
The paper highlights how many foundational anti-terrorism laws arose during, or were adapted to, pivotal moments in the Palestinian liberation struggle ‚Äì often pushed by Israel-aligned groups to reflexively cast the veil of ‚Äúterrorism‚Äù almost uniquely on Palestinians.

# How the US weaponizes terrorism statutes against Palestinians, with Darryl Li
**The Electronic Intifada:** [March 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA)
*  Hello and welcome back to the Electronic Into Thought podcast. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Nora Barrows-Freedman. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=4.28s)]
*  A new briefing paper co-published by the Center for Constitutional Rights [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=6.16s)]
*  and Palestine Legal maps the historical and political context [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=10.36s)]
*  for the current criminalization of solidarity activism and organizing [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=14.88s)]
*  against Israel's genocide in Gaza. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=19.56s)]
*  The paper, Anti-Palestinian at the Core, the Origins and Growing Dangers [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=23.32s)]
*  of US Anti-Terrorism Law, highlights the way in which many foundational [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=28.96s)]
*  anti-terrorism laws arose during or were adapted to pivotal moments [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=33.08s)]
*  in the Palestinian liberation struggle, often pushed by Israel-aligned groups [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=38.24s)]
*  to reflexively cast the veil of terrorism almost uniquely on Palestinians. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=43.32s)]
*  In just the past few months, Palestine Legal writes, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=49.28s)]
*  the Anti-Defamation League has called on university presidents [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  to investigate Students for Justice in Palestine chapters for, quote, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=56.16s)]
*  material support for terrorism. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=60.36s)]
*  And Florida Governor Ron DeSantis used the same rationale to order a ban [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=62.72s)]
*  of SJPs from the state's public universities, a move that a federal court [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=67.52s)]
*  recognized would likely violate the First Amendment. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=72.56s)]
*  Efforts to defund the United Nations Agency for Palestine Refugees, UNRWA, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  have invoked these same support for terrorism laws. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=81.64s)]
*  Joining us to talk about this report and how it can help instruct students, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=85.68s)]
*  activists, and policymakers to use and protect free speech rights [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=89.68s)]
*  is one of its lead authors and researchers, Darrell Lee. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=93.88s)]
*  He's an associate professor of anthropology and social sciences [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=97.44s)]
*  and a lecturer in law at the University of Chicago. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=100.68s)]
*  Darrell, I've been a fan of yours for very long, and it's really great [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=104.2s)]
*  to have you with us on the Electronic Interpolata podcast. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=108.88s)]
*  Thank you, Nora. It's great to be with you. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=112.48s)]
*  So in the introduction to the briefing paper, you and your colleagues write, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  quote, as the more notorious US policies of the post-911 era, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=120.04s)]
*  such as torture, indefinite detention, and targeted killing abroad, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=124.48s)]
*  fade from public memory, these older anti-terrorism laws have been normalized [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=128.84s)]
*  as a comparatively liberal baseline, their structurally anti-Palestinian [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=133.6s)]
*  character having been obscured in the meantime. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  And in the briefing, there's a list of examples of this history. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=141.72s)]
*  Documenting how early US anti-terrorism legislation evolved specifically [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=145.88000000000002s)]
*  to oppose Palestinian liberation struggles and solidarity efforts for those. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=151.20000000000002s)]
*  Let's lay out the origin story of the current moment we're in, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=156.76000000000002s)]
*  in terms of accepted and widespread anti-Palestinian policies and legislation [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=160.12s)]
*  and why it's important to understand where and why it began. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=165.16000000000003s)]
*  What can you tell us about this history? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=168.20000000000002s)]
*  Well, I think that the best place to start [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=170.72s)]
*  as far as like this, you know, the word terrorism has an older origin, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=175.56s)]
*  many other usages. It wasn't invented out of thin air in this context. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=180.52s)]
*  But so, for example, in the early 20th century, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=184.76000000000002s)]
*  transnational anarchists and other left movements were often talked about [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=189.08s)]
*  in terms of terrorism. And there were even some international treaties that were [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=192.76000000000002s)]
*  that were put together during that time. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=197.08s)]
*  But really, the kind of what I think of as like the modern era [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=199.08s)]
*  for the terrorism concept really comes out of the mid to late 1960s. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=202.48s)]
*  And there, of course, you have all the kind of new left movements, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=207.48s)]
*  both anti-colonial movements in the global south and also [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=211.2s)]
*  left movements in in sort of Euro America. Right. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=214.72s)]
*  So thinking of groups like the Black Panther Party, the Weathermen [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=217.84s)]
*  or in in Europe, groups like the Red Army Faction, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=221.6s)]
*  also known as the Badr-Meinhof Gang, Action Direct in France. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=224.64s)]
*  So but Palestine really becomes [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=228.36s)]
*  the sort of key, the key figure in a lot of these debates. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=232.48000000000002s)]
*  And there are a lot of reasons for that. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=236.84s)]
*  One, I think, is that the Palestinian national struggle [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=239.6s)]
*  was an anti-colonial movement. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=244.44s)]
*  But unlike a lot of other anti-colonial movements around that time, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=246.20000000000002s)]
*  think of like Algeria, Vietnam, it was conducting [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=250.24s)]
*  armed struggle, largely from outside of the historic homeland. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=254.16s)]
*  Of course, there were Palestinians living under Zionist colonial rule [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=258.6s)]
*  at the time, but in the 60s, a lot of the action, as it were, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=262.16s)]
*  in the armed struggle was really taking place in the diaspora. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=264.96s)]
*  Right. So in the front line states, Lebanon, Jordan, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=268.56s)]
*  but also with with with sort of armed operations happening in Europe [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=272.24s)]
*  and in other parts of the world. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=277.16s)]
*  So the thing about Palestinian armed resistance was that it was always [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=278.44s)]
*  already kind of internationalized in that time period. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=283.2s)]
*  And because of that, it made it it gave the the Israeli state [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=286.71999999999997s)]
*  kind of a reason to go around to its allies in Europe and the United States [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=291.36s)]
*  and say, look, you know, this is a problem that isn't only directed at us. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=296.28s)]
*  It also implicates your interests. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=300.56s)]
*  And this was an argument that was sort of convincing to American policymakers [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=303.52s)]
*  because they saw these groups as they saw the Palestinian Revolution [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=308.0s)]
*  as not only a threat to its key ally in the region, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=312.04s)]
*  but also a threat to to its to its Arab client regimes. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=314.40000000000003s)]
*  So the so, you know, all states like to call their opponents terrorists [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=318.40000000000003s)]
*  and label them that way. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=323.64s)]
*  And, you know, I think the Israelis just happened to be very successful at it, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=324.6s)]
*  in part because they were so successful in expelling so many of the [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=327.72s)]
*  so much of the indigenous population, right, that they were dispossessing. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=331.92s)]
*  And that kind of like internationalized, if you will, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=335.44s)]
*  the Palestinian struggle, internationalized it in good ways. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=338.40000000000003s)]
*  Right. Like the incredible solidarity across the third world [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=341.68s)]
*  that the PLO was able to build up, the fact that the Palestinian struggle [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=345.16s)]
*  was able to result in representation at the international level in the United Nations. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=348.56s)]
*  But then the flip side, the negative side of that internationalization [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=353.12s)]
*  was being kind of described and and and [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=356.64s)]
*  smeared actually as as terrorists and also really as like the archetypal terrorist. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=362.44s)]
*  So so there are all these groups. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=368.44s)]
*  So if you think about the United States, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=371.16s)]
*  there's a lot of groups that are called terrorists, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=373.28000000000003s)]
*  like the terrorism label operates rhetorically. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=375.88000000000005s)]
*  It kind of becomes a policy instrument. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=378.44s)]
*  But really, when we talk about putting the terrorism term into law [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=380.96000000000004s)]
*  and like writing new laws with new governmental powers, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=385.12s)]
*  it's it's primarily about Palestine and not so much about these other movements. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=389.24s)]
*  And that, again, reflects the the way that the US saw the Palestinian [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=393.56s)]
*  revolution as a kind of transnational threat to its interests around the world. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=398.2s)]
*  For example, calling the Black Panther Party terrorists was something that was done. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=403.84s)]
*  And of course, rhetorically, they were labeled as such. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=407.4s)]
*  But the actual legal instruments used to oppress them were part of the already [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=409.8s)]
*  existing and very ample structures of white supremacy in kind of the domestic US context. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=414.08s)]
*  Right. So it's not as if they necessarily needed like a new set of laws [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=419.8s)]
*  or a new set of legal concepts in order to enact that repression. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=424.48s)]
*  So anyway, that's part of why I think the Palestinian case is is special [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=427.48s)]
*  and then becomes like a prototype that the US then improvises on, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=431.8s)]
*  adds to and expands to other contexts. Right. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=435.92s)]
*  So then the terrorism sort of label and the terrorism policy and legal structure [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=439.12s)]
*  begins to get adapted elsewhere. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=444.68s)]
*  So Palestine is you know, you can think of it as like a laboratory, a canary in a coal mine. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=446.32s)]
*  There's all sorts of metaphors that people often use. Right. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=450.40000000000003s)]
*  But it was really the the main case, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=452.96000000000004s)]
*  the case that was uppermost in mind when the key developments in US terrorism law [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=455.88s)]
*  unfolded in the decades before 9-11. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=461.56s)]
*  So one really straightforward example of this is that the first time the word [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=464.52s)]
*  terrorism appears in federal law is in 1969. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=469.32s)]
*  And it's very relevant today because it's a statute that restricts US funding to UNRWA. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=472.96s)]
*  And the law, I forget the exact wording, but it basically says that [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=479.44s)]
*  funding can't go to UNRWA, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=484.0s)]
*  that can't be used or can't be directed to people who receive training from the [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=486.35999999999996s)]
*  Palestine Liberation Army or engage in acts of international terrorism. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=491.64s)]
*  Now, that term international terrorism isn't actually defined in the law. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=495.88s)]
*  Right. So the law just treats terrorism and being part of the Palestine Liberation Army [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=500.79999999999995s)]
*  as essentially synonyms. And that's the pattern that we see going forward. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=505.67999999999995s)]
*  There's often this thing that people say that like, oh, terrorism is really hard [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=509.4s)]
*  to define when man is terrorist or the man is freedom fighter, blah, blah, blah. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=513.68s)]
*  You know, that's all true. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=517.9599999999999s)]
*  But what's really important to understand about the way states use terrorism [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=519.68s)]
*  as a concept is that they don't really define it as much as they designated. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=525.1999999999999s)]
*  Right. So the whole technology of like having a list of groups. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=529.88s)]
*  So instead of having an abstract debate about what counts as terrorism or what doesn't, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=533.88s)]
*  we just have a governmental body that says, OK, here's a list. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=537.9599999999999s)]
*  The following people or groups on this list are labeled as terrorists and because we say so. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=541.1999999999999s)]
*  Right. So that technology or that technique also develops out of the Palestine context. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=546.24s)]
*  So the first terrorism list from the US government is the state sponsors of [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=551.36s)]
*  International Terrorism List that emerges from the late 70s onward. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=555.92s)]
*  And again, it was very much directed at states in the Middle East and North Africa that were [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=560.68s)]
*  that were seen as supportive of the Palestinian liberation struggle, especially the so-called [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=566.92s)]
*  rejectionist factions. Right. So like the PFLP and so on. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=570.64s)]
*  And out of the eight countries that have ever been designated by the US as state sponsors of terrorism, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=574.88s)]
*  six have been in the Middle East region. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=580.68s)]
*  And getting off the list, one of the major ways in which you can get off the list is by [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=582.3199999999999s)]
*  recognizing the state of Israel, which is what we saw with Sudan in 2021. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=586.52s)]
*  In in 1987, the first time, the only time Congress declared a group to be a terrorist [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=591.8s)]
*  organization was the PLO. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=598.3199999999999s)]
*  And that was a special law that was basically enacted in an attempt to shut down the PLO's [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=600.68s)]
*  offices in the United States and actually wasn't successful, wasn't successful with regard to the [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=606.36s)]
*  US mission, sorry, the UN mission, sorry, the PLO mission to the United Nations. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=611.8s)]
*  The first time the term terrorism appears in immigration law is in 1990. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=618.0s)]
*  And there, again, the definition of terrorist activity, one of its examples includes being an [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=623.2s)]
*  officer or a spokesperson for the PLO. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=631.0s)]
*  So, again, we see this attempt to render Palestinian and or the Palestinian struggle as [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=634.4000000000001s)]
*  synonymous with terrorism. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=640.96s)]
*  In 1992, the first law that allows for private lawsuits on terrorism accusations was also [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=644.0s)]
*  passed with the PLO explicitly in mind. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=653.8399999999999s)]
*  So essentially, the idea was to target whatever assets the PLO had in the United States at that time [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=657.0s)]
*  and to make them subject to legal proceedings. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=662.52s)]
*  And we can maybe talk more about those private lawsuits later because that entire strain of [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=667.0799999999999s)]
*  litigation is very much connected to sort of Americans who go off and sort of exercise [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=672.68s)]
*  colonial privileges in Palestine. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=678.72s)]
*  In 1995, you have the first terrorism assets blacklist, the first terrorism financial [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=680.52s)]
*  sanctions blacklist. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=687.4s)]
*  This was issued in an executive order from President Clinton, and it was basically an [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=689.0799999999999s)]
*  attempt to support the Oslo negotiation process. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=694.64s)]
*  So the name of the list was terrorist groups that threaten the Middle East peace process. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=699.0s)]
*  This was basically a sop to the Israeli Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin, because he was facing [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=705.36s)]
*  very difficult electoral chances. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=711.96s)]
*  And the list included basically the Palestinian factions that rejected Oslo, as well as one [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=714.2800000000001s)]
*  sort of extreme right wing Zionist group for the appearance of balance. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=722.8000000000001s)]
*  It actually lists two groups, but the two names are synonyms for the same kahanist [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=727.2800000000001s)]
*  organization. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=732.28s)]
*  It includes Hizballah, of course, and it included two Egyptian armed opposition groups. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=733.28s)]
*  So that was a favor to the regime of Hosni Mubarak. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=739.9599999999999s)]
*  And in fact, that list, because it was the first list of terrorist organizations for [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=744.4s)]
*  the purposes of freezing assets, that when the first time the United States government [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=752.0799999999999s)]
*  officially designated Al-Qaeda as a terrorist organization, it was by adding them to the [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=756.76s)]
*  list that was meant to support Oslo. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=762.84s)]
*  So the first time the US government writes Al-Qaeda into law as a terrorist organization, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=765.92s)]
*  it does so under the pretext or the rationale that it's a group that is, quote, threatening [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=770.16s)]
*  the Middle East peace process, even though Al-Qaeda's like that was not an area that [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=774.88s)]
*  they were active in. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=779.8s)]
*  But it just became it was the tool that was available at the time. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=781.08s)]
*  So it became one that was easily applicable to other situations. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=784.64s)]
*  And I should mention that the context of the 90s is really when groups such as the Anti-Defamation [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=790.68s)]
*  League in the United States, in concert with the government of Israel, really start pushing [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=797.24s)]
*  the US government to crack down on perceived supporters of Hamas in the United States. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=802.04s)]
*  The arrest of Hamad Salah from Chicago, from Bridgeview, was a big sort of case in this [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=809.72s)]
*  sort of in this in this story. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=816.92s)]
*  And so the ADL had a wish list, essentially, of legislation that they wanted imposed. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=819.6s)]
*  They wanted the US to pass laws that would crack down on fundraising or other forms of [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=826.68s)]
*  support for Palestinian resistance groups. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=832.76s)]
*  And that would make it easier to deport or exclude non-citizens and a bunch of other [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=836.16s)]
*  things. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=842.0799999999999s)]
*  But those were the two sort of main things. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=843.0799999999999s)]
*  So this executive order was kind of like an initial concession to these demands by the [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=845.1999999999999s)]
*  ADL. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=850.04s)]
*  But then the real sort of prize came about the following year. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=851.04s)]
*  So in 1996, the government passed a law that criminalized so-called material support to [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=856.6s)]
*  foreign terrorist organizations. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=863.12s)]
*  So that was the that was the main thing that the ADL was lobbying for. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=865.24s)]
*  That law created the list, the Foreign Terrorist Organizations List, the FTO list. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=869.28s)]
*  And essentially, if a group gets put on that list, then if you provide them with any kind [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=877.08s)]
*  of assistance, and assistance is really broadly construed, right, it includes things that [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=881.54s)]
*  normally would be not unlawful, protected by the First Amendment. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=885.5600000000001s)]
*  But if you provide assistance to those groups, you can be put in prison. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=889.42s)]
*  And if you are a member of one of those groups, you can be deported more easily than otherwise. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=893.44s)]
*  And the charge of materially supporting these groups is the most common, I believe, charge [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=899.1600000000001s)]
*  used in federal terrorism cases. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=905.1400000000001s)]
*  So after 9-11, it's kind of like the prosecutor's favorite go-to toy to throw against all of [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=907.32s)]
*  the sort of American Muslims that they most of them, you know, they they entrapped in [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=914.24s)]
*  sort of like sting operations, concocted plots and so on. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=919.44s)]
*  But the material support charge is extremely broad and pro prosecutorial instrument, which [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=922.5600000000001s)]
*  we have the ADL to thank for that. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=929.32s)]
*  I mean, yeah, I'm just thinking about, you know, for example, the Holy Land Five, which [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=931.12s)]
*  was the largest Muslim charity organization in the U.S. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=937.6400000000001s)]
*  The U.S. government right after 9-11 went after these the heads of the Holy Land Foundation, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=943.52s)]
*  which were giving money to the same organizations in Palestine that USAID was also given money. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=954.52s)]
*  There was no evidence. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=962.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=963.84s)]
*  Of course. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=964.84s)]
*  It's a whole thing. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=965.84s)]
*  It's still like mind blowing that these elders are still languishing in maximum security [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=966.84s)]
*  prisons for helping Palestinian refugees and for helping victims in the U.S. of tornadoes [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=975.1600000000001s)]
*  and the Oklahoma City bomb. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=981.94s)]
*  I mean, it's extraordinary. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=983.2800000000001s)]
*  And they used material support for terrorism law to shudder the organization, seize their [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=985.64s)]
*  assets and send them to dungeons. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=990.76s)]
*  Yep. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=994.44s)]
*  So the part of the pattern that we see here is that the early sort of crackdown is really [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=995.44s)]
*  focused on the frontline states, right? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1004.2800000000001s)]
*  So like the state sponsors of terrorism list. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1007.4000000000001s)]
*  And then it gradually moves inward to the domestic core. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1011.08s)]
*  So then you have immigration law and kind of preventing people from entering the United [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1015.2800000000001s)]
*  States. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1019.12s)]
*  And then finally, in the 90s, you have the material support statute, which you can then [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1020.12s)]
*  use to criminally charge U.S. citizens. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1024.3600000000001s)]
*  So in a way, it's kind of like bringing the war home, right? [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1026.6s)]
*  From the frontline in the areas of confrontation with the Zionist regime all the way to Palestinian [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1030.56s)]
*  diaspora groups that are like thousands of miles away. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1036.6s)]
*  And of course, in doing so, eroding sort of the basic constitutional rights that all citizens, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1040.52s)]
*  not just Palestinian Americans, enjoy. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1046.0s)]
*  So that's obviously a really disturbing pattern in all of this. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1048.0s)]
*  The other thing that is important about this early 2000s moment is that after 9-11 and [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1052.0s)]
*  after all of these new laws, like the Patriot Act and whatever, get passed, prosecutors [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1060.3600000000001s)]
*  are sort of like, they're eager to look for cases where they can easily score convictions. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1065.44s)]
*  And the fact of the matter is that the number of actual supporters or affiliates of groups [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1073.0s)]
*  like al-Qaeda in the United States at that time was like pretty close to zero. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1078.96s)]
*  But the number of people who were very politically engaged and active and involved for Palestine [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1084.1200000000001s)]
*  was nontrivial. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1090.0s)]
*  And those are the people who became the sort of easy scapegoats. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1091.6000000000001s)]
*  So and of course, Zionist organizations had already been badgering the U.S. government [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1094.72s)]
*  to prosecute these people for, you know, basically throughout the 1990s. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1099.8400000000001s)]
*  So that's why the early post-9-11 terrorism prosecutions tended to focus on Palestinians, right? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1104.2s)]
*  So not only the Holy Land Foundation case, also the... [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1111.24s)]
*  Well, you have the Texas part of it, you have the Chicago part of it, but then you also [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1118.4s)]
*  have the case involving Samuel Ariane and his co-defendants in Florida. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1120.92s)]
*  After the first like five, seven years of the so-called War on Terror, then you see [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1126.52s)]
*  a lot more of these terrorism cases being applied to other populations. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1132.16s)]
*  And in a weird way, there's almost like the Justice Department kind of loses interest [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1136.96s)]
*  in Palestine in a way, and also because the chilling effect has happened. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1143.28s)]
*  It worked. The prosecutions, you know, destroyed these organizations. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1147.0s)]
*  They destroyed the lives of those who were working in them. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1152.68s)]
*  And they also sent a strong signal for the Palestinian-American community, but also for [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1154.8400000000001s)]
*  activists in general, to sort of, you know, they all had to like reconfigure their practices [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1159.44s)]
*  around this repressive terrorism regime. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1164.68s)]
*  So that affected everything in terms of like fundraising, solidarity delegations. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1168.16s)]
*  And, you know, and then also, I mean, when you fast forward to the investigations [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1172.3200000000002s)]
*  in the Twin Cities around 2010, right, these were investigations of anti-war activists, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1180.3200000000002s)]
*  pro-Palestine activists that indirectly led to the prosecution and eventual deportation [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1187.68s)]
*  of Rasmiya Odeh, repeller of the Palestinian community in Chicago. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1196.0800000000002s)]
*  So what's really the really important lesson about that story is that a terrorism [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1201.24s)]
*  investigation need not lead to a terrorism prosecution, but it can still turn someone's [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1207.0800000000002s)]
*  life upside down. Right. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1213.92s)]
*  So there's a book actually that a defense attorney has written called Three Felonies a Day, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1215.56s)]
*  making the argument that the federal criminal code is incredibly broad and expansive. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1220.8799999999999s)]
*  And once the government, once the FBI is kind of looking into your life, turning things upside down, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1225.1599999999999s)]
*  it's not that hard for them to find something that you or a loved one, someone you care about, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1230.52s)]
*  has done, even like a trifling infraction of the federal criminal code that can then become [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1236.84s)]
*  the basis for very, very coercive and harsh consequences. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1242.24s)]
*  So, you know, this is a very sordid history, of course. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1248.08s)]
*  And what's crazy is that the debates of the past 20 years around the so-called war on terror [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1251.68s)]
*  that focused on these really spectacular, high attention, high visibility forms of violence, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1258.52s)]
*  like drone assassinations, Guantanamo, that the sort of like the mainstream critique of these [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1265.84s)]
*  policies has been to say, no, America has to return to the rule of law. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1271.6s)]
*  And what they meant by that was to sort of rely on and to really vindicate these anti-Palestinian [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1278.48s)]
*  laws that were passed in the 1990s. Right. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1289.6s)]
*  So the logic of the argument is, you know, these laws are OK because they were passed by Congress. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1292.16s)]
*  Right. As opposed to things that were done sort of, you know, so there's kind of like this American [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1298.2s)]
*  elite intra-debate about, you know, whose vote counts in how you deal violence onto Black and [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1302.92s)]
*  Brown populations, essentially. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1312.3600000000001s)]
*  And, you know, but what gets lost in all of that is that even the so-called normal, quote, unquote, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1314.84s)]
*  federal legislation is also incredibly repressive. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1321.28s)]
*  And yes, as this report shows, has repression of Palestinian liberation as one of its primary [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1324.36s)]
*  intended targets. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1330.12s)]
*  Wow. It's just, I mean, it's shocking, but also not shocking when we look at kind of historical [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1333.08s)]
*  legislation and animus toward Palestinians and those who support the liberation struggle. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1342.28s)]
*  Yeah, I want to say that I imagine that for a lot of the EI audience, nothing in the report will be [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1349.16s)]
*  that surprising. But what I, but just to plead for like some kind of relevance, what is surprising to [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1355.3999999999999s)]
*  me is that the dots have not been connected very much before. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1362.48s)]
*  And there's a lot of interesting reasons for that we can get into, right? [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1368.24s)]
*  But there aren't, I mean, some people have done a little bit of this work, but there isn't, I mean, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1371.48s)]
*  the whole reason why we wrote this report was we were trying to map the threats of terrorism law to [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1376.8000000000002s)]
*  Palestine organizing. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1383.2s)]
*  And in doing so, we realized that not only were there a bunch of laws that are dangerous and [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1384.6000000000001s)]
*  terrible and repressive, but whenever we looked into the history of these laws, it came up again and [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1389.8000000000002s)]
*  again and again that Palestine was the motivating factor, right? [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1394.1200000000001s)]
*  So it's not simply a coincidence that these laws happen to be obstacles to Palestine [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1396.92s)]
*  organizing. That's their entire intended purpose in the first place. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1402.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Let's talk about how this manifests on college campuses, which has been, which have been [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1405.8400000000001s)]
*  flashpoints for anti-Palestinian lobbying efforts for decades. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1415.52s)]
*  Israel lobby groups have explicitly called on university administrations to spy on and prosecute [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1419.64s)]
*  students who engage in Palestine solidarity organizing. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1425.8s)]
*  They've these groups have helped launch smear campaigns with backing and support of [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1429.6s)]
*  lawmakers to harass and threaten students, primarily Palestinian or Arab students, of course. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1436.2s)]
*  How have lobby groups and lawmakers employed anti-terrorism laws to silence campus activism [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1442.3999999999999s)]
*  specifically, especially over the last five months of this genocide in Gaza? [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1448.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, so this is probably not a great analogy, but the way I think of it, but we have to, there's [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1454.2s)]
*  two different discursive weapons that are being used, right? [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1465.32s)]
*  There's the anti-Semitism one and the terrorism one, but they operate somewhat differently. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1470.68s)]
*  I think of them a little bit like the relationship. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1477.52s)]
*  This is the part of the analogy that may not work, but I think of it a little bit like the [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1480.2s)]
*  relationship between conventional weapons and nuclear weapons in the sense that the anti-Semitism [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1484.68s)]
*  allegations, the weaponization of anti-Semitism, that is the bread and butter daily instrument [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1492.32s)]
*  that's used to suppress activism on campuses and just in general throughout society. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1500.12s)]
*  And the laws and policies around anti-discrimination like Title VI, that is where most of the [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1506.04s)]
*  action is happening in terms of repression and push back to repression. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1515.32s)]
*  And that's a separate conversation, but I want to just emphasize that's where most things are happening. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1518.96s)]
*  The terrorism stuff is not like a day-to-day part of the repressive environment on the campus, but [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1524.4399999999998s)]
*  that doesn't mean it's not important. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1533.32s)]
*  And that's why the nuclear analogy comes into play. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1534.8s)]
*  It operates as like this lurking threat in the background. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1538.0s)]
*  So the ADL and the Brandeis Center, which is another one of these, it's like a Zionist [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1542.16s)]
*  activist litigation front, they sent this letter to over 200 university leaders back in October, [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1547.84s)]
*  calling on them to investigate their campus chapters of Students for Justice in Palestine for [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1555.04s)]
*  material support to terrorism. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1560.76s)]
*  That is not like a credible or serious threat because, look, you're like average Dean of [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1563.88s)]
*  Students in a university. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1569.96s)]
*  It's not like within their areas of competence to be conducting investigations under federal [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1571.24s)]
*  criminal law. But I mean, the ADL, they're not stupid. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1576.92s)]
*  Like they know that their letter is not going to make people do the thing that they ask for. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1580.96s)]
*  The purpose of a letter like that is to really increase a kind of atmospherics of fear [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1586.72s)]
*  and to encourage indirect forms of repression, like, for example, increasing, well, it's not [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1593.68s)]
*  even that indirect, but increasing cooperation between campus security forces and law [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1600.24s)]
*  enforcement. Or there's also right now, I forget what it's called exactly, but like a [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1605.6000000000001s)]
*  Homeland Security Advisory Council that's trying to influence policies of universities [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1610.28s)]
*  across the board to adapt more surveillance of online activism, things like that. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1615.88s)]
*  And there's some attempts to get legislation passed around expanding terrorism stuff. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1621.7600000000002s)]
*  So, for example, in Indiana, there is a bill that was introduced that would require state [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1628.0400000000002s)]
*  universities to come up with policies to ensure that none of their funds go to people who are, [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1634.4s)]
*  quote unquote, associated with terrorist organizations or state sponsors of terrorism. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1641.8s)]
*  Obviously, associated is there's no real definition. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1646.3999999999999s)]
*  It's extremely broad. You could read it to mean, you know, a citizen of Iran can't get a [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1649.12s)]
*  scholarship. Right. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1656.84s)]
*  So and so that bill is under consideration. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1659.0s)]
*  And again, even if it doesn't pass, one of the things we learned in this history is that a lot [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1661.32s)]
*  of these repressive laws that we see at the time when they were being debated in Congress, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1666.2s)]
*  there were even crazier laws that were kind of that were that were proposed. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1671.04s)]
*  Right. So what often happens is you pay attention to like the like to take a boxing analogy, you [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1675.8799999999999s)]
*  pay attention to like the right hand. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1681.76s)]
*  Right. But then the left hand is the one that's actually going to come and sort of do the [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1683.28s)]
*  damage. So, yes, there's like really crazy and outlandish legislative proposals, super racist on [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1686.32s)]
*  their face, because in Congress, there's this dynamic of like a race to the bottom and grandstanding [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1692.12s)]
*  in racism against Palestinians. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1696.84s)]
*  But that should not distract us from the other proposals that comparatively might seem more [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1698.6799999999998s)]
*  moderate, but are actually more likely to get passed and to do damage. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1704.6399999999999s)]
*  And in fact, that's actually how the the the instrument of terrorism lists got created. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1708.0s)]
*  So what tends to happen, what tended to happen historically was that people in Congress wanted [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1714.1599999999999s)]
*  to write into the law things like the PLO is a terrorist organization, the Palestinians are [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1719.56s)]
*  terrorists and so on and so forth. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1725.6s)]
*  And because that was a way of showing to their to sort of Zionist constituencies that they cared [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1727.24s)]
*  about, that they were like being really extra. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1732.9599999999998s)]
*  Right. The executive branch tended to resist these kind of measures, not because they were less [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1735.52s)]
*  anti-Palestinian at all, but because putting that kind of thing into statute actually limits the [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1742.36s)]
*  flexibility and the discretion of the bureaucracy and the intelligence agencies and so on. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1750.96s)]
*  Right. So they don't want a law that says who the terrorists are. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1756.72s)]
*  What they want is a law that gives them the power to decide who is a terrorist and who is not and to [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1762.6000000000001s)]
*  take people off the list as a potential carrot. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1769.04s)]
*  Right. So so the compromise in 1979 in the Export Administration Act that was proposed by [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1772.44s)]
*  Senator Jacob Javits, who was like a major Zionist figure at the time, he was the one who came up with [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1779.8s)]
*  the idea of like, OK, look, we've been passing laws saying that, you know, age should not go to [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1784.0s)]
*  terrorists, but we don't define what terrorists are. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1788.76s)]
*  Let's put into law the idea that the secretary of state is the one who has the power to put the [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1791.1599999999999s)]
*  terrorism label on someone. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1798.36s)]
*  Right. Like that is actually it isn't as sexy from the point of view of like grandstanding and saying, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1800.28s)]
*  hey, we passed a law that called Palestinians terrorists, but it's actually much scarier, much more effective [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1805.48s)]
*  because it develops a mechanism and a machinery. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1810.4s)]
*  And that is how terrorism moves from being a rhetorical smear that you put on people to a term that has [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1814.0s)]
*  legally operationalizable consequences. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1821.92s)]
*  Right. It actually becomes a weapon in the tools of the bureaucracy at that point. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1825.48s)]
*  Absolutely. That is Darryl Lee. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1830.0s)]
*  He's one of the lead authors of a new report co-published by Palestine Legal and the Center for [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1833.88s)]
*  Constitutional Rights called Anti-Palestinian at the Core, the Origins and Growing Dangers of US [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1840.84s)]
*  Anti-Terrorism Law. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1847.16s)]
*  Darryl, just in the last week or so, you tweeted about two Zionist groups that have sued the US [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1850.2s)]
*  National Committee of UNRWA. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1857.4s)]
*  Here's the tweet, the UN Agency for Palestine Refugees on accusations of supporting terrorism, the [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1859.8000000000002s)]
*  latest chapter in a longer history of Zionist lawfare in US courts. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1867.4s)]
*  You write, can you talk about who's behind this lawsuit and what it tells us about these lawfare [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1871.92s)]
*  organizations that are directly tied to Israel's foreign affairs ministry right now? [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1877.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so one of the groups that's litigating the case is the International Legal Forum. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1884.96s)]
*  I think that's what it's called. It's an organization that's based in Tel Aviv and it has [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1891.76s)]
*  received a major grant from the Strategic Affairs Ministry. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1896.9199999999998s)]
*  And its function is essentially to combat BDS and other forms of Palestine solidarity activism, [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1901.08s)]
*  especially in the United States. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1908.6s)]
*  How it operates is pretty shadowy. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1910.9199999999998s)]
*  We don't have a lot of details, but yeah, they're the ones bringing, they're one of the groups [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1913.48s)]
*  that's bringing the case. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1918.1200000000001s)]
*  And, you know, it's very, so just so folks are aware, UNRWA is a UN body, right? [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1920.2s)]
*  It receives most of its money from governments. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1928.24s)]
*  UNRWA USA is a nonprofit in the United States that raises money from just individuals to give to [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1930.44s)]
*  UNRWA. Now, personally, in my opinion, it's kind of crazy that such a body even exists because, you [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1937.56s)]
*  know, it shouldn't be up to individuals to be funding UNRWA. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1943.4s)]
*  But that's that's a story for another day. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1946.2s)]
*  But really, it's because of all these repressive terrorism laws, you know, there's a lot of fear [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1948.8400000000001s)]
*  around donating to humanitarian and charitable activities in Palestine. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1955.4s)]
*  So UNRWA USA has been widely seen as like one of the safer or maybe even the safest way for people to [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1960.16s)]
*  make donations to support financially, if that's what they want to do, without running a foul of [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1967.0800000000002s)]
*  these sort of terrorism laws. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1972.68s)]
*  So this lawsuit obviously wants to disrupt that state of affairs. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1975.2s)]
*  And we have to understand it as part of the broader genocidal effort to defund UNRWA and use [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1980.48s)]
*  starvation as a weapon of war against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1986.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1991.3200000000002s)]
*  You mentioned we just have a few minutes left, but you mentioned some of the groups that this [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1994.0800000000002s)]
*  report spotlights in terms of their working relationship with the US government and the Israeli [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=1999.92s)]
*  government officials in drafting this kind of policy, the Anti-Defamation League, the ADL, for [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2005.0s)]
*  example, which viewers and listeners of this podcast will be familiar with, of course. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2011.24s)]
*  It's an Israel lobby group that masquerades as a civil rights organization. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2016.5600000000002s)]
*  And for decades, the ADL has been one of the most, as you as you mentioned, one of the most pernicious [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2021.0800000000002s)]
*  groups working to defame and spy on, slander and smear campaigners for Palestinian rights. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2026.24s)]
*  And in this moment of genocide in Gaza, the ADL has doubled down in its efforts to conflate [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2032.96s)]
*  criticism of Israel and the Zionist project with anti-Jewish bigotry. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2038.92s)]
*  They've released all these reports saying that instances of so-called anti-Semitism are up [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2042.6s)]
*  300, 500 percent when you look at the data points and they're like candlelight vigils for the [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2048.32s)]
*  children who've been slaughtered by Israel with US weapons, stuff like that. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2056.16s)]
*  Can you talk about the ADL as an example of a group that launders anti-free speech efforts [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2062.0s)]
*  through these US anti-terrorism laws? [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2068.24s)]
*  Yeah, so the ADL was really a key player in a lot of the laws that we discussed in the report. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2072.16s)]
*  And we really focus on the period of the late 80s through the 90s, which is also the period when the [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2078.16s)]
*  ADL's own illegal domestic espionage operations against not only Palestinian groups, but anti-apartheid [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2084.2s)]
*  groups, labor organizations, where that scandal was also happening and the ADL was being exposed and [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2091.08s)]
*  they were in litigation around that. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2097.7999999999997s)]
*  They had to pay a settlement. But while they were doing that, they were also lobbying intensely for [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2099.8799999999997s)]
*  these repressive anti-terrorism laws. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2105.4399999999996s)]
*  So, as I mentioned earlier, the law that allows for private lawsuits for terrorism, the ADL lobbied [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2107.48s)]
*  very intensely for that, and the material support statute, the most important of these terrorism laws, [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2112.96s)]
*  was at the top of the ADL wish list throughout the 90s. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2119.28s)]
*  And it almost didn't happen. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2123.44s)]
*  So the story is that in 1995, there was the bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City by two [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2125.32s)]
*  sort of US white domestic extremists. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2136.2s)]
*  And the result of that was a series of laws that rapidly and dramatically scaled up state [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2140.8799999999997s)]
*  repression primarily against Black and brown communities and against Palestinians and Muslims. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2147.56s)]
*  So what happened was that the Clinton administration decided to take advantage of the outrage [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2153.72s)]
*  after the Oklahoma City bombing to pass anti-terrorism legislation. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2159.56s)]
*  And what they did was they took the ADL wish list, right, so the laws that would criminalize sort of [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2163.84s)]
*  Palestine support or Palestine liberation work. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2169.0s)]
*  And they also had a bunch of other laws that are the kinds of things you would expect to see in an [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2172.16s)]
*  anti-terrorism bill. So laws that more strictly regulated explosives and firearms, laws pertaining to [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2176.92s)]
*  wiretapping, things like that. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2183.16s)]
*  And the Republican-led House of Representatives gutted that bill. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2184.92s)]
*  And because they saw the sort of militia groups that carried out Oklahoma City as basically their [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2190.96s)]
*  constituency. So they threw all that stuff out. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2196.72s)]
*  And then in the name of anti-terrorism, they put all of their sort of longstanding anti-crime, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2199.52s)]
*  quote unquote, anti-immigration, quote unquote, initiatives. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2206.08s)]
*  So a lot of the laws that rapidly accelerated the federal death penalty, which, of course, is [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2210.4s)]
*  disproportionately used against Black and brown people, laws that dramatically scaled up the [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2217.08s)]
*  practice of immigration detention and deportation. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2223.92s)]
*  Folks may not remember this, but even in the early 1990s, the number of people being held in [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2227.16s)]
*  immigration detention in the United States at any given time was like maybe a few hundred or a few [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2233.84s)]
*  thousand. It was really this moment in the mid 1990s where that parallel prison system begins to [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2239.08s)]
*  explode as a result of this law. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2245.16s)]
*  And so what happened was that the ADL started ringing alarm bells, the Democrats started [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2249.0s)]
*  ringing alarm bells, and they said, you know, the Republicans have completely thrown out this [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2256.56s)]
*  anti-terrorism legislation. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2263.04s)]
*  They replaced it with something else. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2264.3599999999997s)]
*  And at the very least, can you put back in the parts that are about suppressing Palestine [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2265.8799999999997s)]
*  liberation work? So all of this was a result of the law. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2273.7999999999997s)]
*  All of the other things that they originally wanted, they just kind of gave up on. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2275.16s)]
*  But the ADL organized a letter that was signed by a bunch of other major Zionist organizations. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2278.92s)]
*  And this is not a secret. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2283.96s)]
*  Like they bragged about it. They put out press releases. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2285.7999999999997s)]
*  And even the Republicans realized that they kind of had gone too far. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2287.7999999999997s)]
*  Like Newt Gingrich, the Republican leader at the time, was like, oh, well, maybe we can roll back [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2292.68s)]
*  some of what we did. I'm especially interested in these parts about international terrorism. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2298.6s)]
*  So it's really a reminder of how anti-Palestinian animus is a really strong area of bipartisan [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2303.2400000000002s)]
*  consensus in Washington. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2309.16s)]
*  So the final bill was basically the Republican anti-crime, anti-immigration bill. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2310.92s)]
*  And with the Clinton administration, ADL anti-Palestinian parts of the law put back in. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2315.88s)]
*  And that's how the material support statute and the foreign terrorist organization list [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2323.64s)]
*  found their way into the law. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2328.2000000000003s)]
*  Fascinating. Absolutely. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2329.64s)]
*  And yeah, it just shows what the intentions of these laws have always been. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2331.24s)]
*  At the end of the briefing paper, there's a list of recommendations for policymakers, lawyers, [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2340.8399999999997s)]
*  university administrators, journalists, activists. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2348.12s)]
*  Can you talk about some of the recommendations here and how this briefing paper can be used [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2351.8799999999997s)]
*  to protect defenders of Palestinian rights here in the U.S.? [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2357.0s)]
*  Yeah, the recommendations are pitched at kind of the broadest possible level because [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2363.32s)]
*  we recognize that a lot of different kinds of people might be reading this and running with it, [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2368.52s)]
*  hopefully, in their own ways. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2373.8s)]
*  I mean, one obvious point of commonality that follows from what we were just talking about is [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2375.56s)]
*  that folks should not be taking the ADL as a credible source on anything pertaining to [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2379.88s)]
*  terrorism. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2386.04s)]
*  So that's one thing that's really important. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2387.64s)]
*  Obviously, we have to resist any possible further expansion of terrorism laws, [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2391.0s)]
*  and we should also be building towards their abolition. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2395.64s)]
*  And that's a longer-term goal that I want more people in the movement to be thinking about [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2400.3599999999997s)]
*  kind of concretely because these laws are a structural and concrete impediment to our [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2406.04s)]
*  organizing, and they're also just extremely harmful to many, many constituencies beyond [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2411.56s)]
*  the movement, right? [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2417.0s)]
*  So it's also a way of potentially kind of building relations with other folks. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2417.72s)]
*  So that's important. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2422.2s)]
*  This is maybe a little bit more niche, but it's worth mentioning. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2425.7999999999997s)]
*  There is something about the critical discussion around the war on terrorism in the United States [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2429.48s)]
*  over the past 20 years, especially in legal circles, but also journalists and activists. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2437.16s)]
*  There's been a strange kind of like silo effect where Palestine tends to be not very present in [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2443.16s)]
*  those conversations. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2452.8399999999997s)]
*  And you could say that there's a way in which some Palestine conversations have sort of avoided [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2454.68s)]
*  war on terrorism stuff as well, right? [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2460.7599999999998s)]
*  There's a strange incentive structure where everyone is trying to compete for the attention [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2462.6000000000004s)]
*  and sympathy of white liberals, and then that creates this sort of effect of artificial [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2467.8s)]
*  disconnect and separation. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2473.6400000000003s)]
*  So one of the other things that we really hope comes out of this is that for people [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2475.1600000000003s)]
*  who are really working on war on terrorism, Islamophobia, anti-Muslim animus issues, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2479.96s)]
*  that they also understand the centrality of Palestine to the policies that they're fighting [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2486.28s)]
*  against. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2492.6000000000004s)]
*  A lot of people, I think, are aware of this, but maybe don't have the language to articulate [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2493.48s)]
*  this, and maybe this paper will help fill in some of those gaps. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2498.76s)]
*  And other people, I think, are maybe making a more intentional strategic decision that like, [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2501.88s)]
*  oh, if we talk about Palestine, if we include Palestine, that will somehow make our work more [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2506.6000000000004s)]
*  difficult. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2512.44s)]
*  And I think that's something that we have to sort of debate further, because I don't [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2513.4s)]
*  think that's the right way forward. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2518.52s)]
*  And I hope that a publication like this will really help people understand why that's the [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2519.7200000000003s)]
*  case. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2526.2000000000003s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2527.56s)]
*  And again, the publication is Anti-Palestinian at the Core, the Origins and Growing Dangers of [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2528.28s)]
*  U.S. Anti-Terrorism Law. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2533.88s)]
*  It's a briefing paper that was just published in February, co-published by Palestine Legal [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2536.12s)]
*  and the Center for Constitutional Rights and one of its lead authors, Daryl Lee. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21XJqsDG0QA&t=2541.96s)]
