Video Description: On episode 40, author and editor of The Grayzone Max Blumenthal returns for a wide-ranging discussion. 
We begin with his recent article on the Israel lobby‚Äôs manufactured claims of anti-Jewish bigotry aimed at distracting from last month‚Äôs attack on Gaza and Jerusalem.
At exactly the same time there were massive popular demonstrations in support of Palestinians, claims that there was a new wave of anti-Semitism filled corporate media.
But Max investigated and found these were baseless.
He tells us: ‚ÄúWhat they‚Äôre doing in the US is basically trying to find an exit ramp from the scenes, that even CNN was showing, of media towers in Gaza being taken out for no reason‚Ä¶ or entire families being exterminated to replace the victimhood of Palestinians with that of ‚Ä¶ American Jews.‚Äù
Although the alleged incidents proved to be baseless, some in the Palestine solidarity movement began apologizing for anti-Semitism anyway.
Max explains that there was a campaign by the ‚ÄúNGO wing of some element of Palestine solidarity on Twitter to basically apologize for a wave of anti-Semitism that didn‚Äôt exist.‚Äù
The issue of Syria was also used to try to divide the movement once again, at precisely the moment it was beginning to reunify. ‚ÄúI saw a lot of tweets simultaneously denouncing the ‚ÄòAssadists‚Äô in our ranks,‚Äù he says.

*  Max is the editor of The Grey Zone. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=45.3s)]
*  He's the cohost of Moderate Rebels and the author of many crucial books, including The [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=47.3s)]
*  Management of Savagery, The 51 Day War, and Goliath. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=51.58s)]
*  Thanks so much for coming back on the Electronic Intifada podcast. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=55.82s)]
*  Thanks for bringing me back. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=60.54s)]
*  Let's start with the investigation that you just published on The Grey Zone about the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=63.66s)]
*  manufactured antisemitism instances that seem to be popping up all over, not just the US, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=71.66s)]
*  but in Canada and in Europe. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=80.02s)]
*  The title of your article is To Distract from Gaza's Slaughter, Israel Lobby Manufactures [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=84.34s)]
*  Antisemitism Freakout. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=88.86s)]
*  Yeah, I mean Asa, you were following this a lot too. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=90.86s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it's really a kind of global phenomenon. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=96.94s)]
*  Yeah, so in your newest piece, you explain how the Israel lobby manufactured the rash [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=100.9s)]
*  antisemitic violence in order to smear the Palestine Solidarity Movement. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=110.46s)]
*  And this is your piece on The Grey Zone that Nora mentioned. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=115.89999999999999s)]
*  So could you explain what you found when you investigated this for our viewers who may [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=119.25999999999999s)]
*  not have read the piece and just get into what you concluded? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=124.5s)]
*  Well, yeah, Asa, you've been doing these kinds of investigations ever since, at least since [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=128.26s)]
*  Jeremy Corbyn came on the scene because the distortions and deceptions are very similar. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=136.46s)]
*  What the British Israel lobby wanted to do was paint Corbyn and everyone around him as [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=143.94s)]
*  an antisemite. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=148.78s)]
*  And they would often create these confrontations or create them with, for example, Ken Livingstone [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=150.66s)]
*  or people around him to give the British public the impression that something was very wrong [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=156.82s)]
*  and that somehow a Nazi had slipped through and not a veteran anti-racist. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=163.42000000000002s)]
*  And what they're doing in the US is basically trying to find an exit ramp from the scenes [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=168.5s)]
*  that even CNN was showing of media towers in Gaza being taken out for no reason other [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=175.04s)]
*  than the fact that the Israelis were a frustrated Goliath or entire families being exterminated [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=180.86s)]
*  and to replace the victimhood of Palestinians with that of the one of the most affluent, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=187.5s)]
*  entitled hyper privileged demographic groups on the planet, American Jews. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=194.54s)]
*  And so they did it by using deceptively edited video, video without context, a pile of allegations [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=201.78s)]
*  that couldn't be substantiated just to create a general atmosphere of hysteria. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=211.86s)]
*  Of course, corporate media played along partly for ratings and partly because of the longstanding [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=217.06s)]
*  sympathy of the kind of personnel that fill the management of corporate media outlets [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=223.74s)]
*  for Israel and their longstanding relationship with the main organization behind this narrative, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=229.78s)]
*  which was the Anti-Defamation League, the ADL better known as the Arab Defamation League [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=237.82s)]
*  or the Defamation League because all they do is defame Arabs. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=242.86s)]
*  So what I did was like, what you know, those like Bellingcat dweebs call OSINT and they [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=246.66s)]
*  try to make their craft seem so sophisticated and so vital. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=254.74s)]
*  Like it's this vital form of journalism, but all the it's OSINT, open source intelligence. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=259.1s)]
*  I think things on the internet. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=264.3s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=265.58s)]
*  Like you look at video and study it and examine it or you study Google Earth images or whatever, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=267.06s)]
*  tweets, Facebook pages. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=275.18s)]
*  Yeah, finding things on the internet. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=276.66s)]
*  It's like stuff we used to do before they existed. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=277.82s)]
*  And we just, I always thought of it as like a kind of crude form of journalism that you [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=279.98s)]
*  do and you can't be in the field or you're not actually working with documents. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=285.82s)]
*  And I didn't get documents from intelligence agencies, by the way, but that's beside the point. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=290.58s)]
*  So I just looked at the videos of the high profile incidents. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=297.66s)]
*  There was one video in particular that Don Lemon on CNN, big pro-Israel, loudmouth host of CNN [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=301.66s)]
*  was constantly showing and he had this young man, this 23 year old from Long Island who had come [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=312.82s)]
*  into New York City, said he was attacked by a mob of Palestinians because he was wearing a keep, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=318.82s)]
*  a Jewish skull cap. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=323.86s)]
*  And Lemon would show this mob beating this guy. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=325.9s)]
*  Yeah, he was getting a beat down. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=329.90000000000003s)]
*  One guy hit him with a crutch and it looked bad. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=333.22s)]
*  But I watched the full video and the guy was wearing a gray hoodie which covered his head at all [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=336.98s)]
*  times in the video. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=344.94s)]
*  There were clear photographs of the incident afterwards showing that his head was completely covered. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=347.06s)]
*  There was no way to know that he was Jewish. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=354.38s)]
*  So clearly something had happened to precipitate this conflict. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=356.82s)]
*  What's more, this guy, Joseph Borgen, actually after getting hit a few times on the ground, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=360.97999999999996s)]
*  got up and had to be held back by cops as he attempted to charge at the people who were hitting him [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=368.38s)]
*  and challenging them to fight. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=374.82s)]
*  So he was really aggressive. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=376.46s)]
*  Like if I were just walking down the street and someone committed a hate crime against me out of nowhere, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=377.82s)]
*  I wouldn't be getting up and trying to fight them after some cops came and rescued me. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=383.98s)]
*  And so I gathered witness testimony. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=388.9s)]
*  The witness testimony corroborated the witness testimony I saw buried in media reports of the incident, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=392.78s)]
*  which was that pro-Israel demonstrators on their way to a pro-Israel demonstration actually attacked [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=398.34s)]
*  the Palestinian young men on their way to a Palestine solidarity demonstration, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=404.46s)]
*  both in Midtown New York with the Israelis planning theirs in a very, you know, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=409.78000000000003s)]
*  in a location where they would make sure they were near the Palestinians. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=415.7s)]
*  And there were media reports of pro-Israel elements throwing bottles of juice and water out the window [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=419.90000000000003s)]
*  at Palestinians and their supporters as they marched by. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=426.86s)]
*  So you basically have a story that's 180 degrees different than the official version of events, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=431.34000000000003s)]
*  which was conveyed to the American public about Jews just being beaten down. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=438.26s)]
*  And, you know, I can go through incident after incident. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=442.38s)]
*  They all follow the same pattern. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=446.53999999999996s)]
*  But it got to a point where Joseph Biden, the president, and Kamala Harris, the vice president, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=448.46s)]
*  denounced this wave of anti-Semitism. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=454.34s)]
*  And it really creates the perception among at least some sector of Jewish Americans that they're under siege [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=457.06s)]
*  and that they need an Israel to protect them or a place to go take shelter. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=464.78s)]
*  And when, in fact, the reality is in the UK and the US, we're living in a golden age, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=469.05999999999995s)]
*  we're much better off than Jews are in Israel. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=474.02s)]
*  That is the least safe place for Jews to be. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=476.65999999999997s)]
*  It's also a place where Jews are conscripted at age 18 into an apartheid army to carry out the warehousing [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=479.9s)]
*  and even extermination of an indigenous population. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=489.53999999999996s)]
*  So that's why this narrative is so not just false, but dangerous and insidious. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=492.70000000000005s)]
*  And it's nice to actually see lots of people, including more mainstream segments of the Jewish left [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=500.42s)]
*  than I represent, actually calling it out. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=508.18s)]
*  It was interesting, too, because it followed the exact same pattern that the, you know, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=513.0600000000001s)]
*  how the media covered the attacks on Gaza as though the clock started when, you know, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=520.42s)]
*  the Palestinian resistance forces fired rockets into Jerusalem. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=527.4599999999999s)]
*  When, you know, when you pull back the camera and you look at the macro situation, of course, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=532.5s)]
*  that's not when the clock started. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=538.66s)]
*  Israel is always the aggressor. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=540.74s)]
*  Israel always is the perpetrator. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=542.2199999999999s)]
*  And so, yeah, kind of talk a little bit about how just these kind of mechanisms of, like, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=545.2199999999999s)]
*  presenting these stories completely devoid of any historical or factual context. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=552.8199999999999s)]
*  And, you know, if there's any change to perception now, I feel like after the attacks in May, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=559.9s)]
*  there has been more of skepticism and criticism of not just Israel and Israeli policy, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=572.54s)]
*  but of the US's support of it. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=580.5799999999999s)]
*  Do you see any, like, you know, relationship between the two? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=582.9s)]
*  Well, just to address the first part of your point, David Sheen, longtime EI contributor [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=587.4599999999999s)]
*  and Israeli-Canadian journalist living in Haifa, wrote a really important piece for us [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=594.0999999999999s)]
*  at the Gray Zone on how Netanyahu's coalition was hanging by a thread. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=600.86s)]
*  In order to construct the coalition, he brought in these kahanists, the extreme right of the far right [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=606.26s)]
*  of, like, the already right-wing Israeli political spectrum. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=613.0600000000001s)]
*  The right of the right of the right. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=619.74s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=621.38s)]
*  The ultra-right of the far right. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=621.98s)]
*  I mean, it's what the Israeli philosopher, Yeshay Hu-Leibovich, would have called Judeo-Nazis. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=624.5799999999999s)]
*  That's essentially what they are. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=631.62s)]
*  These very characters, I've followed them and filmed them rioting against Africans in Tel Aviv. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=634.38s)]
*  They do that in the South Hebron Hills. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=640.54s)]
*  We know who they are. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=643.06s)]
*  Everyone watching this knows who they are. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=643.66s)]
*  And they were brought into the government by Netanyahu. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=645.62s)]
*  And then they were kind of turned loose around Jerusalem when Netanyahu needed a war to stave off [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=649.86s)]
*  what we see happening now, which is his coalition completely collapsing. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=656.58s)]
*  And they gave him the war that they wanted, that he wanted, by provoking Palestinians all around [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=661.1800000000001s)]
*  Jerusalem and generating a military or a militarized response by the police around the Al-Aqsa compound. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=668.1400000000001s)]
*  These were the events that precipitated what took place in Gaza. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=677.62s)]
*  And as I think John Elmer pointed it out in one of your last podcasts, that the resistance [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=681.14s)]
*  factions in Gaza were actually breaking out of their ghetto and sending a message to Israel over Jerusalem. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=688.0600000000001s)]
*  This war began over Jerusalem, not over the siege in Gaza. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=695.58s)]
*  So that's what precipitated the war. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=699.26s)]
*  And yes, it was all edited out of the mainstream media narrative in the US, which we saw consisted of [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=701.58s)]
*  Israel versus Hamas. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=712.3000000000001s)]
*  That's how NPR, the Washington Post, the New York Times framed it. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=713.6600000000001s)]
*  The Israeli Hamas conflict, that's what they called it. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=716.7800000000001s)]
*  But it was really much more of a Palestinian wide uprising on all levels across Palestinian society, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=719.94s)]
*  across walls, across all these militarized barriers that Israel's constructed than we have seen at any time since the second Intifada. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=730.58s)]
*  So it really was the Jewish-Israeli military versus Palestinian society. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=739.9000000000001s)]
*  That's what was taking place. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=749.94s)]
*  And David made an interesting point about my article in one section in particular, where there were these two [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=751.7800000000001s)]
*  Israelis who said that they were attacked in Times Square, sorry, in Midtown East for speaking Hebrew. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=760.6600000000001s)]
*  They were set upon by a Palestinian mob that happened to be kind of marching down the street just because they heard them speaking Hebrew. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=767.86s)]
*  The reality in the video shows that one of the Israelis is holding an Israeli flag in his hand and starts punching Palestinians and initiates the violence. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=773.6600000000001s)]
*  And then he begins to taunt them, chanting, long live the state of Israel, as cops are dragging him away. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=782.98s)]
*  They arrested him because he initiated the violence. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=788.54s)]
*  And it turns out that these two characters were Gholani Brigade veteran soldiers who had served in the 2014 assault on Gaza, in which 551 children were killed. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=791.94s)]
*  They after the assault, they started a GoFundMe headlined with pictures of themselves in the thumbnail image, punching Palestinians in Midtown, raising money for the Gholani Brigade. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=804.1s)]
*  But they went on Fox News, portraying themselves as victims of a hate crime. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=818.18s)]
*  Then they went to Hebrew media, Hebrew language media in Israel on a far right network or right wing network bragging to the host about how many Palestinians they punched. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=821.5799999999999s)]
*  The host was celebrating them as these Jewish lions who were not like the the weak hearted liberal Jews of America. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=830.8599999999999s)]
*  And David said that's the that's the Israeli society's entire narrative about what took place in Lod, for example, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=839.14s)]
*  or Haifa, where there were or Bat Yam, these these mixed cities where mobs of Jewish extremists were brought in under police protection to assault Palestinians. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=847.14s)]
*  And then Jews were portrayed as the victims of these assaults in the kind of official story. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=859.58s)]
*  But privately, everyone was like, yeah, yeah, we we we we heard them good. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=864.1800000000001s)]
*  So that's it was a perfect microcosm for the narrative of Israeli society. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=869.46s)]
*  And their narrative is so divorced from what anyone who uses social media sees. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=877.62s)]
*  So I think that's where that was kind of the firewall for a lot of, I would say, progressives in the US, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=883.62s)]
*  including people who are on the fence, who are not already like E.I. or Mondo Weiss or gray zone readers, like people who were questioning this. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=892.62s)]
*  They would see footage produced by Palestinian journalists in the Gaza Strip, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=901.6999999999999s)]
*  tweeted out by people and young people in Gaza who speak perfect English. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=909.14s)]
*  You know, they've gone to the UN schools and they understand social media. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=915.2199999999999s)]
*  And really, Twitter has advanced a lot since 2014. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=918.86s)]
*  The audience is much wider. You can use more characters. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=922.8199999999999s)]
*  It's easier to use video. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=925.42s)]
*  So the documentation of this assault was much more vivid on Twitter, Instagram, everywhere than it had been in the past. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=927.18s)]
*  And I think this provided a sort of a it transcended. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=935.9s)]
*  What whatever the Israel lobby was trying to convey in mainstream media or the limitations of the New York Times, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=944.78s)]
*  which kind of is getting hailed for featuring all these murdered children on its cover, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=952.34s)]
*  but which still conveyed pretty much the official narrative or the typical liberal Zionist line that most of its correspondents uphold throughout the 11 days of fighting around Gaza. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=959.7s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it was very clear during the time that. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=975.8199999999999s)]
*  Israel has always been Israel and its military and its defenders and its advocates have always been the ultimate aggressors posing as the victims. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=980.6999999999999s)]
*  And, you know, I didn't see this covered very widely in in mainstream media, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=989.02s)]
*  but what you were talking about with with extremist Jewish Israeli armed militias in inside [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=995.38s)]
*  cities in present day Israel were organizing themselves en masse in hundreds over over social media, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1005.38s)]
*  over internal instant messaging applications like WhatsApp and Telegram. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1014.06s)]
*  And this was being done either with them relying on the passive support of Israeli authorities or on the outright support of Israeli authorities. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1019.86s)]
*  And there are these two Israeli liberal groups who were kind of infiltrated all of these all of these messaging messaging groups, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1030.98s)]
*  which contained hundreds and it's also contained settlers who lived in Jewish only colonies in the occupied West Bank were planning and actually did arrive in Israeli cities. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1039.7s)]
*  In buses to attack Palestinians and these these two groups that infiltrated those those. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1049.9399999999998s)]
*  Those internal messaging apps where people were organizing themselves into armed militias found some of the most violent correspondents between these groups, you know, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1060.54s)]
*  just you cannot make this stuff up like exchanging pictures of weapons, exchanging threats, talking about wanting to break Palestinian bones. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1070.62s)]
*  There was one message that I'll never forget that said, you know, it was all in Hebrew, but we did the the translations of it and it said, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1080.1799999999998s)]
*  today we are Nazis, today we are no longer Jews, we are Nazis. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1089.1s)]
*  And there is just something so perverse that is happening right in front of everyone's eyes. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1092.66s)]
*  And I and I understand that it's always been either the right or the extreme right in Israel. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1099.38s)]
*  But I truly feel like there is an even there is a move to even go further than that. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1103.8600000000001s)]
*  There the society is just going so extremist and so right wing. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1109.94s)]
*  And we're seeing that with the new Bennett Lapid rotation now. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1115.18s)]
*  Yeah, one of the things that that I mean, that line really stuck with me, too, from your piece that you wrote with our colleague, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1120.02s)]
*  Ali Abunimah Tamara about the Judeo-Nazis, you know, really, I mean, look, I mean, this is this is really a theme. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1126.82s)]
*  You mentioned, Max, earlier my work on the Labour Party and Jeremy Corbyn and the bogus anti-Semitism allegations against them over the years. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1137.3799999999999s)]
*  And one of the one of the recurring themes in that was this attempted ban on any kind of raising of the word Nazi in the context of Israel, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1147.58s)]
*  you know, any kind of historical comparison or anything like that. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1159.98s)]
*  And, you know, that's been enshrined in the the so-called EUMC working definition of [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1164.7s)]
*  the working definition of anti-Semitism by the IHRA. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1174.06s)]
*  And, you know, that you're not supposed to make these kind of you're not supposed to mention the Nazis. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1181.02s)]
*  Don't mention the Germans. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1186.38s)]
*  But like, I mean, again, this is another example of reality contradicting, you know, reality violates this definition. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1188.94s)]
*  Well, they're violated. Yeah, you have Zionists calling them violating the IHRA. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1199.42s)]
*  Yeah, they they this is their words. You know, it's not are we not supposed to report the truth? [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1204.3s)]
*  You know, yeah. Yeah. I wonder if the UDL is going to condemn that. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1211.18s)]
*  I mean, they're it's sort of considered offensive to mention Lenny Brenner's book on 51 documents of Zionist Nazi collaboration. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1214.7s)]
*  This is a sort of blue collar historian, Lenny Brenner. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1227.38s)]
*  He was, you know, affiliated with a lot of kind of Trotskyist socialist groups. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1232.18s)]
*  He was the treasurer for Stokely Carmichael for a time. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1238.94s)]
*  I got to meet him once and he put together a book with the title that I just cited. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1241.62s)]
*  And it's just documents of that that provide evidence of collaboration between the Zionist movement and Nazi Germany. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1249.5s)]
*  And there was a relationship or a marriage of convenience between the labor wing of Zionism and Nazi Germany to bring Jewish people and property over [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1258.9799999999998s)]
*  and allow the German government of Adolf Hitler to take a portion, to take a cut and to basically bypass and eliminate, destroy the Jewish global boycott of Nazi Germany. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1267.7s)]
*  American Zionist groups were basically told, stop boycotting Nazi Germany. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1284.8200000000002s)]
*  And, you know, because, you know, they're they're they're helping us out in historic Palestine, build this state that we're dreaming of. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1288.94s)]
*  And, you know, Hitler himself was very aware of this relationship. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1298.26s)]
*  You had people in the Jewish office working under Eichmann, like Leopold von Mildenstein, who was actually taking tours of the kibbutzim [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1305.7800000000002s)]
*  and very admiring of what the Zionist movement was doing in Palestine. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1315.14s)]
*  He said the Trumpledorians, referring to Joseph Trumpledor, one of the heroes of the Likudnik Zionism or revisionist Zionism, are very similar to us. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1319.74s)]
*  The, you know, the the brown shirts and their connection to the blood and soil of their movement. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1329.7800000000002s)]
*  And so when von Mildenstein actually returned to Germany from this trip he took of kibbutzim, he received a medallion. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1337.42s)]
*  On one side was, unfortunately, the star of David that the Zionist movement had co-opted as its symbol. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1345.5400000000002s)]
*  And on the other side was the swastika, the symbol of the Nazi party. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1352.3400000000001s)]
*  And when I met Lenny Brenner, he actually had brought this medallion, which he managed to pick up at a auction. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1357.42s)]
*  And it was just so disturbing. It felt like my like when I held it in my hand, it felt like I was holding something that was a thousand degrees. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1366.3s)]
*  And it was like burning in my hand. It was just so disturbing to actually see it. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1374.58s)]
*  This relationship was not just political or economic. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1380.06s)]
*  There was a ideological dimension to it. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1385.54s)]
*  The Stern Gang that ultimately produced Yitzhak Shamir as prime minister. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1388.82s)]
*  He was one of their leaders. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1393.98s)]
*  The Stern Gang that assassinated Volky Bernadotte because he attempted to organize the return of Palestinian refugees who had been cleansed in 1948 as UN special representative to the Holy Land. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1396.02s)]
*  The Stern Gang that carried out the Daryusin massacre in 1933 when Hitler was rose to power. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1409.3s)]
*  He wasn't actually elected, but when he rose to power, the Stern Gang issued a letter pledging or offering a sort of strategic partnership and pledging to establish a fascist Jewish theocracy in the Holy Land. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1417.42s)]
*  I mean, nothing really came of that, but it shows that there's an ideological dimension to all of this. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1433.98s)]
*  And it's more complex than indicating the revisionist Zionist assassinated, Heimarl Losseroff, who was the second in charge of the labor Zionist movement. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1440.42s)]
*  He was in charge of the Jewish agency because he was overseeing that transfer agreement with Nazi Germany that I mentioned before. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1455.9s)]
*  So there were elements of the revisionist movement that were opposed to all of this, but there was still a mutual shared affinity. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1463.0600000000002s)]
*  Now you flash forward to the contemporary era of Zionism, where the movement that reveres Meir Kahane, this fascist rabbi who was killed, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1469.82s)]
*  who basically helped popularize or gave voice to the feeling in Israeli society that Palestinians should all be ethnically cleansed, that there should be sort of a second Nakba, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1481.5s)]
*  and that a Jewish exclusivist theocratic state should be established that would just kind of end the whole situation of negotiation once and for all. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1494.02s)]
*  The mainstreaming of this movement really created the context for what we saw take place in these mixed cities. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1504.94s)]
*  And I remember, you know, I was staying when I was working on Goliath back in like, I started work on it in like 2009, and I was staying in Jaffa in 2010. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1512.86s)]
*  And I was actually kind of getting the sense that these elements, these Kahanist elements were starting to operate in the area, particularly like 10 or 15 minutes south in Bat Yam, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1527.3799999999999s)]
*  which is a mixed area where a lot of Russian and Mizrahi, lower and lower middle class Jews were living among Palestinians and there was a lot of tension. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1538.3s)]
*  And the Kahanists were coming in from the West Bank and from the extremist settlements and attempting to basically pour lighter fluid on those simmering flames. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1547.1s)]
*  I was reading their newsletter that they would put it out online and they had like operation. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1558.5s)]
*  I forget what they called it, like seal the locks or something, but they would target Palestinian homes by filling their locks with glue and cement to make it impossible for them to get back in their houses. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1563.9s)]
*  And this is the kind of thing they were doing to try to turn up the heat in these areas. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1575.22s)]
*  It's something they're doing all across Palestine, but particularly in areas inside Israel. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1579.5800000000002s)]
*  And this is the context to the context of this latest escalation. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1587.74s)]
*  So what we saw there was totally expected with basically a night of broken glass in Bat Yam where these extremist mobs, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1592.66s)]
*  many of them were settlers who came in from the West Bank, were smashing the glass storefronts of Palestinian businesses. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1603.5400000000002s)]
*  And if you know the businessmen and you know that class, they really are very uncomfortable with any form of protest against occupation. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1611.46s)]
*  They're always trying to maintain good relations with the Jewish majority just to secure their place. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1621.9s)]
*  And yet they still got attacked. People were beaten. Orin Ziv, the photojournalist from Active Steals, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1628.74s)]
*  he actually documented pretty clearly how the police were directly working with these mobs. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1635.5s)]
*  And the function these mobs played was actually kind of as a paramilitary, like what we see in Colombia right now, where the bike police are a little bit overstretched. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1640.8200000000002s)]
*  So they bring in just groups of plainclothes thugs who've been filmed shooting protesters in the streets. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1649.26s)]
*  The deputy mayor of Lid actually described them in that way. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1655.98s)]
*  Like he said, he said they were volunteers coming in from the West Bank. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1659.3s)]
*  I believe that was his exact word, right? Is that right, Tamara? [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1662.82s)]
*  Yeah, volunteers. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1666.14s)]
*  He said they were coming to protect Jewish homes and that he advises all Palestinian citizens to remain in their homes because they're coming to help out. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1667.62s)]
*  They're coming to protect Jewish homes in Israel. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1675.58s)]
*  I mean, the security forces, if you can call them that, you want to call them the apartheid maintenance forces that might be more accurate. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1678.46s)]
*  They were overstretched because of what was happening in Jerusalem, because of what was beginning to take form in and around Gaza. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1686.46s)]
*  And the pressure on the Israeli leadership to completely suppress this uprising inside 48 Palestine or Israel was enormous. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1696.94s)]
*  This is really the ultimate fear of the Jewish Israeli public. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1711.3s)]
*  It's very similar to the fear of the southern agrarian class during the 1850s, particularly after John Brown's organized uprising around Harper's Ferry of a massive or Nat Turner's uprising of a massive slave revolt in an area where they are basically outnumbered. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1715.8999999999999s)]
*  That fear has led to violence in the past. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1735.86s)]
*  It's led to the killing of 13 demonstrators around Malfahim and Haifa in 2000. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1739.7s)]
*  And the same thing happened. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1745.98s)]
*  Ehud Barak was prime minister then, and he met with all the security principals and he said, you have a green light to do whatever is necessary. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1747.54s)]
*  Netanyahu took it to another level. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1755.94s)]
*  He staged a nationally televised press conference with the security chiefs behind him and he said, you have a green light to do whatever is necessary and there's not going to be a commission of inquiry. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1758.1000000000001s)]
*  He was referring to the Orr Commission that investigated the killing of those 13 demonstrators in 2000 and found that the Israeli government was systematically discriminating against Palestinian citizens. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1768.34s)]
*  Netanyahu was like, none of that's going to happen. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1781.58s)]
*  Just go for it. Bring in the thugs. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1783.5s)]
*  Let the dogs out. Do whatever is necessary. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1785.98s)]
*  So, I mean, and that's what, thank you. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1788.82s)]
*  Thanks to social media, we were able to see how vicious the suppression was. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1791.58s)]
*  And it's ongoing as we speak, you know, as you've been reporting at EI with the mass arrest of hundreds of young people. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1797.7s)]
*  In your piece, just to kind of circle back, you report on how Palestine solidarity and leftist or progressive groups, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1807.7s)]
*  instead of debunking, questioning or even asking for any evidence, instinctively responded and continue to do so by condemning anti-Semitism, despite there being little or no evidence of it. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1817.3s)]
*  You know, this is what Corbyn fell victim to instead of like completely dismissing this charge of anti-Semitism. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1831.94s)]
*  He began apologizing for it. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1840.78s)]
*  Why is this so dangerous? [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1844.18s)]
*  And, you know, what should Palestine solidarity activists be doing instead of, you know, kind of playing into this like Israel lobby tactic of trying to make everything anti-Semitism? [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1848.1000000000001s)]
*  Well, there was a active campaign among the kind of like NGOing of some element of Palestine solidarity on Twitter to basically apologize for a wave of anti-Semitism that didn't exist, along with I saw a lot of tweets sort of simultaneously denouncing the Assadists in our ranks. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1864.42s)]
*  Or maybe they meant the ass sadists. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1887.34s)]
*  I think they're referring to Assadists, who basically people who people who oppose regime change in Syria. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1889.22s)]
*  Yeah, that was very interesting. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1896.62s)]
*  Like that was happening. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1898.06s)]
*  I mean, exactly the moment Gaza was being bombed, the sort of well, I mean, it wasn't a lot of people, but it was like a few very vocal people on Twitter who used that exact moment to sort of say, if you're retweeting or, you know, posting articles from any of the following. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1899.22s)]
*  You are X, Y, Z, you know, it was very interesting timing, let's say. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1917.26s)]
*  Well, yeah, it always seems to come at the wrong time or for them the right time at a time of unprecedented unity around Palestine, or we're kind of coming back into this moment of unity. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1924.26s)]
*  Let's divide everyone again over and over the most divisive or one of the most divisive issues. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1935.98s)]
*  But they're not I don't think they're thinking that way. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1943.18s)]
*  As with the anti-Semitism charge, this class of activists is always appealing to elite influence and authority and trying to demonstrate their worthiness to Western and particularly American elites and their entire campaign around. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1945.5800000000002s)]
*  Palestine hinges on acceptance by those elements that someday we will be accepted in Congress or we will be accepted by mainstream media and they will make room for us and provide representation. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1966.82s)]
*  The New York Times will have a good Muslim columnist who cares about Palestinians and then the situation will be resolved. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1979.86s)]
*  Who needs like all those like bearded Shia guys who are providing [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1988.6999999999998s)]
*  Gaza resistance factions with the know how and weapons to actually hit back. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=1994.5s)]
*  That's uncouth. That's their mentality. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2000.54s)]
*  And that mentality is I mean, I think it was repudiated this time by a lot of people, a majority within the movement who were like, they're trying to criminalize us. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2005.06s)]
*  We saw what happened in the UK. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2018.46s)]
*  We are not going to apologize for having rallies and chanting intifada. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2019.98s)]
*  And that is what the ADL was demanding. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2027.78s)]
*  If you actually look at their report, the ADL's report where they lay out their case that there's a wave of anti-Semitism and an uptick of anti-Semitic incidents because of the what they call the Israel Hamas conflict. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2030.26s)]
*  There's no there there. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2044.1000000000001s)]
*  They are literally defining rallies across the country as anti-Semitic incidents. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2046.3000000000002s)]
*  And so why allow them to define you as an anti-Semite and then criminalize you? [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2051.3s)]
*  In the UK, I think we I mean, getting hundreds of thousands of people out in the street to demonstrate for Palestine was, of course, it was about the like defending the basic humanity of Palestinians who are being [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2058.06s)]
*  exterminated and dispossessed. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2073.2599999999998s)]
*  It was about asserting international law. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2075.3399999999997s)]
*  It was about opposing apartheid. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2077.62s)]
*  But it was also about defending the democratic rights that are under complete assault by the Israel lobby and its allies among the British elite and saying we are here and we're not going to be criminalized for basically being decent moral people who are sick of your like little imperial schemes. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2079.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it was very, very similar in the UK. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2099.8199999999997s)]
*  Like, as you mentioned, like what one week one weekend during the war, there was one hundred and fifty thousand demonstrating in London and there was demonstrations all over the UK as well. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2102.34s)]
*  And then the following weekend, there was two hundred thousand people demonstrating in London, filling up Hyde Park. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2112.5s)]
*  And again, demonstrations all over the UK. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2117.1000000000004s)]
*  Even after the ceasefire, too. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2119.78s)]
*  Yeah, it carried on after the ceasefire. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2121.5s)]
*  There was activists who did sit-ins on top of Elbit factories, Israeli weapons manufacturers. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2123.38s)]
*  And this this unprecedented moment of unity and then these kind of sabotage, different sabotage strategies are coming in. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2130.42s)]
*  And someone from Dave Rich of the Community Security Trust, which is this Israel lobby group, essentially, but it fulfills quite a similar role in the UK as the ADL, quite a similar group in some ways. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2136.78s)]
*  He actually tweeted a photo. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2150.7400000000002s)]
*  It's funny you mentioned about Andy Fadden because he tweeted a photo from a demonstration. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2153.6600000000003s)]
*  I forget exactly what he said, but it was a photo of a sign that just said, victory to the Intifada, I think it was. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2158.2999999999997s)]
*  It was it was something about Intifada. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2163.82s)]
*  And he said, this is do you hate her on the streets of London? [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2166.7s)]
*  You know, so, you know, it was exactly the same, exactly the same. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2170.42s)]
*  And what look at the pro-Israel rallies in and around London. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2176.5s)]
*  I mean, who was there? [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2180.42s)]
*  Tommy Robinson. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2182.1s)]
*  Yeah, he was like the star of the show. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2183.5s)]
*  He comes in, everyone's taking selfies with them. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2185.46s)]
*  It's like, you know, there's there's this is who they're left with. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2187.7s)]
*  This is the thing. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2192.2599999999998s)]
*  Like there was I mean, there was rumours going around and I mean, I can mention this is rumours. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2193.02s)]
*  But, you know, unable to verify them. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2201.8199999999997s)]
*  But there was people online saying that and this is Zionists who were saying it like pro-Israel people who were saying it. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2204.02s)]
*  They reckon that Tommy Robinson was actually invited by some some of the organisers of the demonstration, essentially to make up the numbers. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2212.7000000000003s)]
*  And I read I'm on the Zionist Federation's newsletter and I just read in it today that they were saying that people were came from all around the country to attend the demonstration. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2223.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2236.34s)]
*  So they were busing people in and still they only got less. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2236.74s)]
*  Press reports said 1500 people, so it wasn't very many people. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2243.2599999999998s)]
*  I mean, even if I were some pro-Israel, if I really believed in Israel, I wouldn't have shown up at one of these demos. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2247.1s)]
*  It's like a time of shame. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2253.94s)]
*  It's like Chuck Schumer who called himself Charles Chomair, the protector of Israel at one point. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2255.14s)]
*  He hasn't said a word about this. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2260.8199999999997s)]
*  Nobody wants to say anything. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2262.66s)]
*  No one's piping up to defend Israel. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2263.98s)]
*  It's kind of a moment of hanging your head. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2266.62s)]
*  So, of course, if you're going to fill up your rally, it's going to be like the BNP and EDL and Tommy Robinson. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2269.42s)]
*  Like, those are the people that are going to come out in the in the US. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2276.3s)]
*  The largest pro-Israel rallies were in Los Angeles, and that's where the most fervently, almost fascistic pro-Israel elements live. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2280.18s)]
*  And their rallies just looked absurd to any rational person. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2290.94s)]
*  The one mass- [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2295.82s)]
*  They're going down Rodeo Drive or something like, you know, in Beverly Hills. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2297.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2302.1s)]
*  Who are you appealing to? [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2302.5s)]
*  I commented on Twitter that I thought it seemed... [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2303.7s)]
*  Was that supposed to be like a threat against Paris Hilton or something? [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2306.34s)]
*  You know, it was just a way of us showing how oppressed they are in Beverly Hills. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2309.66s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2315.22s)]
*  Max, one of the things I really liked and it was a great piece and we'll link to it. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2316.14s)]
*  One of the things that stood out to me was a bit towards the beginning where you're quoting from the official Israel account where it's saying, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2323.1s)]
*  to all our Jewish brothers and sisters around the world, we see you, we hear you, we stand with you. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2331.22s)]
*  And they posted a blue square in clear imitation of the black square, you know, the Black Lives Matter movement, [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2336.9s)]
*  which was criticized by some people, you know, in itself anyway. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2344.3399999999997s)]
*  But very clearly they're trying to sort of copy and co-opt this kind of movement. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2347.54s)]
*  And I really like the way you put it in the piece where you said, [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2353.7s)]
*  the Israel Foreign Ministry has capitalized on the moral panic of alleged anti-Semitism with a tweet invoking the intersectional social justice lexicon of woke millennials. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2356.46s)]
*  And Zoomers, I guess. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2368.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2369.62s)]
*  That really shows you how hollow that kind of language is and how easily co-opted it is. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2370.98s)]
*  Because whether it's by the Israeli Foreign Ministry or the CIA with its sort of woke recruitment ad, [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2375.06s)]
*  the language can be easily transferred to support imperialism or Zionism. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2380.62s)]
*  And I always said Zionism is the terminal. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2385.1s)]
*  It's the sort of terminal stage or sort of it's kind of like right wing woke politics. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2388.1s)]
*  It is basically woke politics for right wing Jewish supremacists. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2398.54s)]
*  This is something we saw a lot again in the Labour Party, the campaign against Corbyn, [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2405.62s)]
*  where there was a lot of invocation of this kind of language to sort of say by these people who called themselves Labour Zionists or left wing Zionists to say, [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2409.94s)]
*  oh, well, Zionism is just self-determination for the Jewish people, you know, and, you know, [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2421.38s)]
*  oh, a Jew is saying this, so you should believe us, you know, that this is anti-Semitism. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2426.9s)]
*  We know anti-Semitism when we see it. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2431.9s)]
*  And, you know, you can't question that. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2434.1800000000003s)]
*  If you question that, then you are anti-Semitic. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2437.42s)]
*  And it just became this self-perpetuating fantasy that was, I mean, the people who did this were really a minority within a minority. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2440.42s)]
*  But there was this kind of inordinate fear that this successfully generated, you know, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2449.1800000000003s)]
*  and people were really intimidated by it. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2454.7s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I mean, it's intimidating to take on the identitarian arguments of people who are pushing, [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2457.1s)]
*  for example, when people are pushing regime change in Syria, which is a goal that the NEO considers. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2466.66s)]
*  Then, yeah, listen, listen to Syrian voices. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2473.1s)]
*  And, of course, the voices of people in West Aleppo, where the majority of Aleppians live, [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2475.2999999999997s)]
*  or the people in Damascus or the loyalist population, which simply is the majority right now, [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2480.74s)]
*  they don't count and they're fascists anyway. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2489.1s)]
*  But it's intimidating if you're not a Syrian and somebody comes out who's like in, you know, at SOAS or whatever, [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2492.7s)]
*  and they say, I'm a Syrian, shut up, like, we know better than you, then you have to shut up. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2499.8599999999997s)]
*  That's the kind of identitarian argument that's been or tactic that's been used for several years. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2504.62s)]
*  It really has been effective on Twitter, which is where most people where you see a lot of the political confrontation and one on one arguments. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2513.98s)]
*  And, you know, it's effective in open letters also to try to shut down a critique of anti-imperialist critique. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2523.8199999999997s)]
*  I think it's sort of it's being exposed right now as the same tactics are being employed. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2536.02s)]
*  The same tactics are being employed by white imperialist oppressors. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2541.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, like you conclude in the piece, I mean, this really is kind of what it represents [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2547.02s)]
*  with what's been going on recently in the Palestine Solidarity Movement in North America. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2553.46s)]
*  It represents a kind of Corbynization really, and they're trying to, Ali always says they're trying to do a Corbyn on, [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2560.7s)]
*  they tried to do a Corbyn on Bernie Sanders in the event, you know, he didn't win the primary anyway. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2568.38s)]
*  And now they're trying to expand the tactic more widely. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2576.98s)]
*  I mean, you conclude in the piece, we're all Jeremy Corbyn now, and I think that's accurate. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2580.1s)]
*  You know, there's a real kind of push. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2584.58s)]
*  It was successful, like it wasn't successful in the maximal goal of persuading people to support Israel, people on the left to support Israel. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2587.94s)]
*  If anything, it had the opposite effect of that long term, but it was really successful in its really primary goal, which was to sabotage the movement. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2597.86s)]
*  It really it did divide people and it intimidated people and Corbyn didn't become foreign minister, you know. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2605.14s)]
*  Yeah, and it was I thought it was inevitable from the beginning. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2613.74s)]
*  I was surprised he did so well in 2017, but that was because I mean, I think that it. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2617.18s)]
*  Yeah, the anti-Semitism issue is not what cost Jeremy Corbyn the red wall. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2623.9s)]
*  It's not what cost Jeremy Corbyn so many votes, but it is what demoralized people in the inner circle of his movement. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2630.94s)]
*  And also the grassroots of the movement, the grassroots soldiers, the foot soldiers who went door to door. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2639.7000000000003s)]
*  They were I mean, just talking to people, they weren't there in 2019 to the extent that they were in 2017 because people were so demoralized that being expelled from the Labour Party or driven out from the Labour Party. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2646.26s)]
*  I think it's what created space for this kind of metropolitan professional consultant class to come in and say, you need to revise the Brexit vote and you need to start listening to us instead of listening to your own constituents. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2657.42s)]
*  And that's what led to the collapse. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2672.2200000000003s)]
*  But it's just a good case study in never giving an inch to pro-Israel forces, never give an inch to your adversaries, whether they're imperialists, pro-Israel forces, woke imperialists. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2674.34s)]
*  Whatever they are, if you give them an inch, they will take a mile and they will never accept an apology, no matter a good faith apology, they always act in bad faith. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2687.82s)]
*  So you just have to look at the situation as it is. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2699.34s)]
*  You have to hold on to your version of reality and defend it at all costs. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2703.54s)]
*  And I was a little bit concerned before I started producing a series of tweets that provided the architecture for this investigation that maybe I would get it wrong. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2709.2599999999998s)]
*  Maybe there were some serious anti-Semitic attacks where Jews were attacked as Jews and then I would be humiliated and have to issue some kind of apology. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2722.06s)]
*  And I studied the issue. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2733.9s)]
*  I mean, I just looked closely at all of these incidents and I felt confident coming out and saying this is utter bullshit. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2735.66s)]
*  This is what they did in the UK. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2744.42s)]
*  And I'm willing to defend that. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2746.34s)]
*  But other people face harsher consequences than I do because they're not Jewish. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2748.46s)]
*  If you're Palestinian in the US, it's much harder to come out and say this. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2755.82s)]
*  But you have to be willing to hold on to your version of reality because you're not dealing with good faith actors. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2760.94s)]
*  You're dealing with people who literally want to criminalize your right to defend your own, to defend your rights. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2767.74s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that process you described just now is something I went through internally many times in reporting on the Labour Party. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2775.7s)]
*  And, you know, at the end of the day, if there I mean, the way I always put it is this and what many activists within the Labour Party made the point that [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2783.5s)]
*  Amoshe Makova made this point as a, you know, his academic background is mathematics and logic. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2795.58s)]
*  So he said, logically, in a party of half a million people, the Labour Party, statistically, if you compare that to [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2802.42s)]
*  the rates of prejudice in the UK and rates of antisemitism in the UK, statistically, it's impossible that there will be no [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2810.02s)]
*  antisemites in the Labour Party. But if anything, it's actually when you actually look at the number of instances of even of allegations of antisemitism, it's incredibly, incredibly low. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2817.14s)]
*  So some marginal examples of antisemitism actually taking place does not negate the fact that a vast amount of high profile cases were either exaggerated or outright fabricated, you know, just [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2829.54s)]
*  most cases, it is just Zionists accusing antisemitism of being antisemitic. They're just redefining the definition of Zionism. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2845.7000000000003s)]
*  I told the story of... [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2854.8199999999997s)]
*  Definitely about semitism. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2856.14s)]
*  Totally. I told the story a bunch of times. I don't know, I think probably I told it when we had you on Moderate Rebels, but [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2857.22s)]
*  one of the first times Corbyn was attacked in the context of, you know, being a leadership candidate for being an antisemite was after he hosted me. He wasn't even present at Port Cullis House in Parliament. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2864.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I remember. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2879.3399999999997s)]
*  And they made up this guy, Richard Millett, who's just this notorious ultra Zionist fabricator concocted this story that I was introduced by a Holocaust denier. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2879.98s)]
*  But I was introduced by Corbyn's staff and I got there an hour late. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2892.5s)]
*  I just completely screwed up my schedule and you all know how I am with scheduling. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2901.5s)]
*  So, and yeah, so anyway, I got there. You can see like in the video, I had this huge cowlick on my head. I'm just all messed up. Like, I'm still extremely jet lagged. I'd been dealing with, you know, so many things back home. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2905.46s)]
*  And I just walk in the room and give a talk, went off very well. But apparently there was some public forum to make up for the other hour I wasn't there. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2920.2200000000003s)]
*  And some guy I'd never heard of got up and talked and said nothing offensive. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2929.7400000000002s)]
*  And Richard Millett said he was a Holocaust denier. And I went and looked for the evidence that he was. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2933.82s)]
*  And there was some, you know, he's like an old man with a big beard and he, you know, maybe he looks eccentric. So maybe that was off putting to some people, but he's holding a sign that's basically comparing Israel to Nazi Germany. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2939.2200000000003s)]
*  And you can say, oh, that's wrong. That's offensive, but that's not Holocaust denial. So I don't know where that even came from, but it made it to the Daily Mail. I think it was reproduced everywhere. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2954.2599999999998s)]
*  And I mean, the British press is just the worst in the world. Like, I really think it is. This is the point Glenn Greenwald makes sometimes. Like they do just make things up. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2965.7799999999997s)]
*  And this is the facts did not matter to them at all. There was any cut, anything they could throw at the wall to just get rid of Corbyn in any kind of way. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2975.46s)]
*  Well, here's my point. Well, let me just make my quickly just wrap up the story, which is that I went to Jeremy's chief of staff. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2984.34s)]
*  And I said, like, we should take this down. Like, you know, this is one of the first attacks and they're going to, they're not going to stop coming. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2990.58s)]
*  And he was, he said, we've decided the people are with us and there is no need to respond. This just won't matter. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=2996.98s)]
*  And that's the way they continued to conduct themselves. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3004.7400000000002s)]
*  I also, I also, I also had met with Seamus Milne. He's a great guy. Someone I really was, he's someone who has inspired my work with his own columns and writings. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3008.98s)]
*  I was coming from Germany where I, the German Bundestag had introduced legislation to declare me and David Sheena and persona non grata. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3024.9s)]
*  And we were branded as anti-Semites from the moment we entered the country by people who weren't even Jewish. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3037.1400000000003s)]
*  So I told him, like, this anti-Semitism thing is out of control. It's going to come for you next. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3042.9s)]
*  And I don't, I just don't feel like he, I conveyed the message sufficiently to him or that he, he internalized it. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3050.66s)]
*  I think they never really got it. And then you had Jeremy Corbyn apologizing for standing next to some mural that had guys around the table with money who were just global bankers. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3057.46s)]
*  And he apologized to the Jewish community for that. It was just so bizarre to me. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3069.22s)]
*  I was always, across the Atlantic trying to figure out what the hell was going on with his political operation and where was the anti-Semitism. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3075.54s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, there's no consequences for this bad faith, propagandistic, Hasbara, misreporting. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3086.74s)]
*  I mean, on our side, if we get anything wrong, if there is anything that we misreported or, I think, God forbid, we would never fabricate evidence. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3097.46s)]
*  But if that was found to be true, we would be rightly culpable and we would be taken to task. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3110.34s)]
*  But for the Zionists, for the mainstream corporate press, when Don Lemon presents this complete fabrication of an anti-Semitic incident, there is no consequences. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3118.1s)]
*  There is no public apology. There is no reinvestigation of an incident and any sort of mea culpa. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3133.3s)]
*  And the Israeli government knows this very well. That's why the Golanee Brigade soldiers can go and fundraise after this kind of thing. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3140.7400000000002s)]
*  Well, I think it's why it's so important to have independent media. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3151.5400000000004s)]
*  I got the sense that in the UK, independent media was kind of a new thing. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3156.34s)]
*  When the attacks that the Canary UK was getting and Squawk Box and all of these outlets that emerged to support Corbyn, [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3162.02s)]
*  we've had this kind of scaffolding of, or like an echo chamber to support various movements and political parties in the US since the mid 2000s. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3173.38s)]
*  But it felt like it was like a new thing in the UK. But there has to be an apparatus to circumvent the power of mainstream media. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3186.82s)]
*  I see a lot of younger Palestinians who are media oriented and highly educated and they wonder why they're not getting enough of a platform in the Washington Post or the New York Times. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3195.22s)]
*  And they're starting to open up their pages to them. But you're just never going to get the traction that you deserve there to offset the phony deceptive narratives of the entrenched Israel lobbyists in these publications, [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3209.86s)]
*  whether it's Brett Stevens or Barry Weiss, the former New York Times columnist, or people who are basically, they're not Israel lobbyists, but they're Israel sympathizers like Jake Tapper or Wolf Blitzer, [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3226.02s)]
*  who feel threatened and attacked by the sheer presence of Palestinians in media. You have to really focus on building up independent media. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3239.14s)]
*  And instead of breaking into mainstream media, you should be focused on breaking it, just completely discrediting it at every level. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3251.06s)]
*  There should be, I just feel so, I wouldn't say resentful, but I don't understand why so many self-described socialists want to write for The Guardian. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3259.06s)]
*  Like, what are you thinking? You should be trying to like utterly break The Guardian into a thousand pieces. You should be supporting the Canaries boycott of The Guardian. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3271.38s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think as well, you're right. Like, we're never going to get the kind of traction in those corporate outlets. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3281.38s)]
*  But we should just define them as the enemy that they are. They've destroyed our movement again and again and again. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3293.7000000000003s)]
*  And I really don't care if they throw us a little crumbs by putting photographs of murdered children on the cover once and then going back to the way they were. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3301.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think these crumbs, sorry, I don't think these crumbs are even for us. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3310.2599999999998s)]
*  I think it's just to whitewash their own conscience and to try to appear as sympathizing with Palestinians. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3314.98s)]
*  But this is not for their bottom line as well, because they see that there's an audience for it. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3323.2999999999997s)]
*  Of course. Yeah. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3328.1s)]
*  I mean, it's both the Haaretz and the New York Times who published those front page stories of the 60s or the almost 70 Palestinian, [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3330.98s)]
*  I think two Israeli children who were killed during Israel's massacre in May. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3341.46s)]
*  And I saw a lot of tweets saying how this is unprecedented and it's welcome and even mainstream media is catching up to it. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3348.5s)]
*  But I really don't think it's about us at all. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3359.7s)]
*  And I don't think it says anything different about the New York Times or Haaretz. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3362.66s)]
*  I think it's like a cleanse of their own conscience. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3368.2599999999998s)]
*  And who are they? I mean, we've seen how many former New York Times Jerusalem bureau chiefs and correspondents have children in the Israeli military. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3370.8199999999997s)]
*  Jodi Radorin, she's off basically promoting liberal Zionism at the forward, [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3380.42s)]
*  which has become like this full on racist publication or became under what's her name? [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3387.86s)]
*  Batia. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3393.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3394.82s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, it's just so patently obvious when you look at the personnel who they put in their Jerusalem bureau, [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3396.26s)]
*  which is in the home of Hassan and Ghada Karmie, a basically stolen Arab home, [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3405.22s)]
*  what the New York Times is and which part of the society it feels attached to and whose anxieties it absorbs and which narrative it conveys [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3412.1s)]
*  and how hard it is for Palestinians to even affect the narrative against that inertia, [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3424.8199999999997s)]
*  that ideological, political and ethno-religious inertia. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3433.3799999999997s)]
*  It's very difficult. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3438.5s)]
*  I always was like, why don't they send some Mexican American guy to be the bureau chief? [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3439.9399999999996s)]
*  Or like, why is there never been... [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3445.2999999999997s)]
*  They always have to have a Jewish bureau chief in Jerusalem who happens to be a Zionist. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3448.18s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3454.98s)]
*  And like familial ties to the Israeli military and the entire apparatus of the Israeli state. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3455.86s)]
*  And if you call that out, you're an anti-Semite. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3463.86s)]
*  Right. Yeah. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3466.2599999999998s)]
*  But it's like, enough is enough. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3467.54s)]
*  I mean, Tom Friedman bought that house from... [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3469.46s)]
*  He bought this stolen Arab home when he was the bureau chief. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3473.62s)]
*  And you've just had a steady succession of bureau chiefs completely... [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3477.38s)]
*  I mean, and Tamara is right. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3482.42s)]
*  It's not only what they do report, it's what they refuse to report or don't report. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3484.34s)]
*  A seven-year-old was arrested today by Israeli forces. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3488.58s)]
*  I'm sure these guys will do a great job facing down the men of Hezbollah, by the way, [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3493.46s)]
*  if they're practicing on seven-year-olds. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3498.02s)]
*  But I mean, that could be a headline. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3499.86s)]
*  I mean, when I was writing Goliath, it was like, there's just so many crazy stories [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3502.2599999999998s)]
*  that I couldn't believe that... [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3507.46s)]
*  And of course, they would never make it into the New York Times or any mainstream outlet. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3508.8199999999997s)]
*  And I was just gathering them every day, either from alternative media on my own, [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3512.8199999999997s)]
*  through word of mouth or Hebrew language or Arabic language media. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3520.42s)]
*  I remember a group of Palestinian women from Nablus, [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3525.06s)]
*  one of the most harshly occupied cities in the West Bank, were brought to Yad Vashem, [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3528.98s)]
*  the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Jerusalem. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3534.98s)]
*  They were allowed to go across the apartheid wall [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3537.78s)]
*  to observe the historic suffering and oppression of Jews. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3541.94s)]
*  The condition of their coming into Jerusalem was they got to go to the Holocaust Museum. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3547.54s)]
*  And as soon as they get there, [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3551.7000000000003s)]
*  Jewish children, groups of Jewish children, religious nationalist Jewish children... [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3553.94s)]
*  And I'm talking about children, like eight years old, 10 years old, [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3557.94s)]
*  start attacking them, calling them... [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3561.06s)]
*  And throwing things at them. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3563.3s)]
*  And they were basically subjected to a hate crime at the Holocaust Museum. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3565.78s)]
*  So, I mean, that was just one of those stories. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3570.02s)]
*  Why wasn't that in the New York Times? [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3572.34s)]
*  That perfectly shows you what Israeli society was becoming. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3573.86s)]
*  That showed you what was on display in Bat Yam, [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3579.2200000000003s)]
*  this extremist, eliminationist hatred that's becoming mainstream. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3581.46s)]
*  But it's never conveyed. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3586.18s)]
*  So it always comes as a shock to Americans when we see the real Israel on social media. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3587.7s)]
*  Right. And especially for American Jews, our community. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3594.4199999999996s)]
*  This is not the real Israel. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3602.66s)]
*  Our community. I hate saying that. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3603.62s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3605.94s)]
*  I'm not like... I don't know what community we're talking about here. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3607.06s)]
*  There are like a hundred different American Jewish communities. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3609.7799999999997s)]
*  Like I walk through Borough Park and I'm not in their communities. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3613.14s)]
*  No, no. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3616.74s)]
*  But that's the thing about Zionism is that we move as a monolith. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3618.9s)]
*  Whatever happens in Israel happens to us. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3624.5s)]
*  And when these liberal Zionists were waking up in the middle of mid-May [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3628.2599999999998s)]
*  with Israeli airstrikes against people's homes, [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3634.98s)]
*  tens of thousands of people huddling in United Nations centers. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3638.7400000000002s)]
*  Oh, this is not our Israel. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3645.06s)]
*  Israel is a piece... I mean, Avi Meyer was saying this [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3648.42s)]
*  ahead of the American Jewish community. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3652.5s)]
*  This is not who we are. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3658.5s)]
*  But that's like the dark secret of Jewish Israeli society is that [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3661.2200000000003s)]
*  there are all of these fractious communities. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3666.5s)]
*  There are so many of them. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3670.66s)]
*  They actually don't like each other. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3671.9399999999996s)]
*  Like the Russian Jews in Israel who often don't have any connection to religious Judaism. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3674.18s)]
*  Many of them don't even like it there. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3681.06s)]
*  They were just kind of tricked or dumped there by the Jewish agency. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3682.58s)]
*  The Mizrahi Jews, they don't like the Ashkenazi elite in Tel Aviv. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3686.74s)]
*  The Ashkenazi elite called them arseem and they hate them. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3690.66s)]
*  They look down on them the way elite liberals who believe in science look down on Trumpers. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3694.5s)]
*  There's just all of these divides, I mean, intense and intense hatred. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3702.82s)]
*  And they all unite around their resentment of the one group that's below all of them, [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3708.34s)]
*  which is Palestinians. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3715.94s)]
*  Without Palestinians, there would be no glue to hold the Zionist ideology [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3717.46s)]
*  and Israeli society together. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3723.54s)]
*  Without the occupation, there would be no reason for Jewish Americans who donate all this money [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3725.86s)]
*  to the ADL to actually come together in support of Israel. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3732.42s)]
*  And then they would lose their own identity because without Israel, [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3736.82s)]
*  then all they have left is religion and they're not secular Jews aren't into that. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3739.7s)]
*  So this whole Zionist movement, the global Zionist movement needs Palestinians so badly. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3744.98s)]
*  It needs the occupation. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3751.46s)]
*  It needs apartheid. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3753.06s)]
*  It needs these constant conflicts to unite it and to provide it with this kind of dynamic [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3754.34s)]
*  way forward in the place of an actual national vision. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3760.9s)]
*  Israel has no national vision going forward. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3771.2999999999997s)]
*  There's no five-year plan. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3774.1s)]
*  There's no one-year plan. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3775.46s)]
*  It's just to win like these series of wars and keep this fractious society united. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3776.74s)]
*  That's the dark secret. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3781.7s)]
*  And it's very disturbing when you think about its implications for policy and politics. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3783.7799999999997s)]
*  Israeli society has advanced to the point where it's adopted its own form of identity politics, [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3789.8599999999997s)]
*  where people are more into their Jewish national heritage prior to coming to the Holy Land now [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3798.2599999999998s)]
*  than they were before. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3808.98s)]
*  In Tel Aviv, there'll be a restaurant that says shtetl and you'll see Iraqi Jews selling [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3810.7400000000002s)]
*  sbikh, which is a kind of traditional Iraqi Jewish sandwich. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3815.46s)]
*  And there's a Mizrahi group of, I don't want to call them ultra leftists around Tel Aviv, [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3819.2200000000003s)]
*  but they're just obsessed with Mizrahi identity to the point where they are unable to [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3824.58s)]
*  be part of a mass social movement. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3833.1400000000003s)]
*  And but it still all flows back into Zionism because they have this idea in Zionism that [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3835.8599999999997s)]
*  there's nowhere else to go, especially for the Mizrahi and Russian Jews, and that they're [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3845.14s)]
*  the ones who have to fight. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3850.5s)]
*  And we haven't even mentioned the Ethiopian Jews who suffered, I think, the most in their [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3851.54s)]
*  transition into Israeli society. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3858.18s)]
*  They were told that their traditional form of prayer was not actual Jewish prayer. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3860.2599999999998s)]
*  Although it predated the European ultra orthodox forms of prayer, some were subjected to [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3865.7799999999997s)]
*  coerced sterilization in the camps. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3874.18s)]
*  I don't know what they're like, camps for, they weren't really refugees, but the camps [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3880.66s)]
*  where they were transferred before. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3885.4599999999996s)]
*  Settlement camps. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3886.5s)]
*  Transit camps. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3887.8599999999997s)]
*  They were basically duped into taking transit camps by Jewish NGOs that have offices in [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3888.58s)]
*  New York. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3897.06s)]
*  They were coerced into taking depo provera. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3898.1s)]
*  And they, just from my experience in the West Bank, like being in the villages around the [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3902.02s)]
*  wall that were doing the popular struggle, Nora, I know you've been around that a lot, [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3910.5s)]
*  and being in the South Hebron Hills, when there was an Ethiopian commander for a unit, [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3918.66s)]
*  you would know that they were going to be less inclined to negotiate, or things were going to [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3926.5s)]
*  escalate pretty quickly. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3934.42s)]
*  Because they had to demonstrate to the Ashkenazi and Mizrahi members of their unit that they were [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3937.22s)]
*  tough and that they were loyal, because there was only one group below them, and otherwise, [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3943.14s)]
*  they were at the bottom of Israeli society. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3947.54s)]
*  And actually, we started to see Black Lives Matter marches and rallies inside Israel by [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3949.86s)]
*  the Ethiopian population. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3956.98s)]
*  And it was the first time that the Israeli police used the skunk spray on a domestic [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3958.34s)]
*  population, was against those marchers. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3963.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3968.18s)]
*  And I don't know if this is still the case, but Israel has historically [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3969.38s)]
*  stationed Ethiopian and Druze soldiers at the border areas around the Gaza boundary, [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3977.62s)]
*  because they wanted to make sure that the Ashkenazi soldiers were safe. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3989.62s)]
*  Well, I mean, the whole population that lives close to Gaza was basically put there as a human [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=3997.14s)]
*  wall. And they're the first, the Mizrahi, then the Russians, because the Ashkenazi didn't want [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4003.78s)]
*  to be there. And then they turn right wing because they're absorbing the consequences of [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4010.1800000000003s)]
*  Israel's occupation and siege of Gaza, which is rocket fire. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4015.86s)]
*  The whole population of steroid is fully right wing. They're the ones who call for an assault [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4019.46s)]
*  on Gaza before anyone else. They're mayor and they're municipal authorities. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4023.94s)]
*  And there are lower middle-class and lower-class Mizrahim. Then Ashkelon, it's Russians and Mizrahim. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4029.62s)]
*  That used to be called Ashkelon. And their population was rounded up in 1948, spent two [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4037.54s)]
*  years in a concentration camp effectively. And then they were dumped in Gaza. And then you just [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4043.7s)]
*  bring in the human wall of the people that the Ashkenazim don't want around them in Tel Aviv [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4048.5s)]
*  or Netanya or wherever they live. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4055.14s)]
*  I mean, it's disgusting and it helps feed into the dynamic of militarism. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4058.26s)]
*  Let's pivot to your thoughts on the Israeli government. I mean, people are like, you know, [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4071.94s)]
*  I can see the New York Times, for example, the LA Times over the weekend, you know, kind of like, [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4077.3s)]
*  oh, this could be the end of the Netanyahu administration. And Israel could get someone [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4085.1400000000003s)]
*  who's more like in the dovish camp, for example. What are your thoughts on [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4090.1800000000003s)]
*  the Israeli elections and the significance of them at this point? [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4099.3s)]
*  I mean, I get tired of all the horse race politics. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4103.860000000001s)]
*  But I feel like more free to like unburden myself of my true thoughts about Israeli politics, which [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4109.7s)]
*  is like that I was happy when Netanyahu was reelected because he helped lift the mask on the [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4118.5s)]
*  real Israel that would have still been massacring Palestinians and occupying them under a labor or [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4126.66s)]
*  Kadima or blue and white government. There is no alternative. And if anything, the Labor Party and [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4136.42s)]
*  these non-licude governments have been more blood soaked. Netanyahu, however, was able to communicate [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4143.9400000000005s)]
*  Israel's position really well on the world stage. He was like this really effective con artist or [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4155.9400000000005s)]
*  televangelist. And he, I mean, he was simply brilliant. Some of the manipulations he staged [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4164.02s)]
*  were simply brilliant, for example, with the Iranian nuclear documents or orchestrating a [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4172.02s)]
*  presentation of documents that as Gareth Porter has reported for us at the Gray's and were probably [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4177.06s)]
*  forged by the Mossad and were laundered through the MEK. But Netanyahu's presentation [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4182.26s)]
*  was very effective in creating an atmosphere of hostility during the Trump administration to [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4189.22s)]
*  destroy the JCPOA. And he even said in his presentation, Mosin Fakhrizadeh, watch, remember [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4199.46s)]
*  that name. And then they go and assassinate him. Netanyahu has just been a commanding presence. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4205.780000000001s)]
*  Presence. And he also was effective at undermining Obama and forcing Obama to constantly respond [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4212.099999999999s)]
*  to Israel and pander to Israel in public, humiliating him at every stop. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4221.78s)]
*  You replace Netanyahu with someone like Naftali Bennett. I mean, this guy is a schmagegi compared [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4226.98s)]
*  to Netanyahu. He really is a small, I mean, he literally is a small man, but I mean, Netanyahu [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4232.74s)]
*  was like part of the Siret Makhtal special forces unit that was in the Entebbe raid. He has like a [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4240.58s)]
*  real connection. Bennett, he carried out some massacres in Lebanon. He brags about it all the [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4245.94s)]
*  time. Everybody brags about it. Yeah. But he's like, I actually met him once at this little [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4252.98s)]
*  press conference he did where he had this PR firm introduce him to the international English [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4259.62s)]
*  language speaking media on his way towards being eventually prime minister. Because he [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4265.86s)]
*  knew which way Israeli society was going. It was religious nationalist. You got to wear a little [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4273.0599999999995s)]
*  knit kippah. And he talked the talk. And so the PR firm was helping to kind of kosher him [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4278.42s)]
*  to the English speaking media that thought maybe he was too extreme. And he got like, [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4286.82s)]
*  he had a little sit down with the new republic guy and he met with everyone except me. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4291.38s)]
*  And like I tried, I followed him into the parking lot asking him questions that I wanted to ask him [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4295.86s)]
*  and he just refused to speak to me. But I was just, he just felt like such a diminutive presence [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4300.66s)]
*  that I couldn't actually imagine him being prime minister. And now here he is. He's finally arrived. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4306.9s)]
*  He speaks perfect English, but he's never, his shtick is never going to go. He doesn't even have [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4311.46s)]
*  a shtick. It's just not going to go over well in the U S. And then he's got Yair Lapid, whose father, [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4316.58s)]
*  Tommy Lapid ran this party. The whole party existed just based on the hatred of the ultra [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4322.18s)]
*  Orthodox Haridim and the Arab population of Israel because they didn't serve in the military. And the [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4328.66s)]
*  party had no meeting other than that. Yair Lapid, you know, he spent some time in Hollywood. He was [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4335.14s)]
*  like the manager of Regent Studios. He was working for Arnon Milchan, who was, he was, he was doubling [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4342.1s)]
*  as a Hollywood studio head and a Mossad agent who helped Israel sell nuclear parts to South Africa. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4349.86s)]
*  Wonderful guy. And, you know, he's so- Sounds made up, but it's absolutely true. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4356.42s)]
*  It's so wild. And Lapid, I mean, he's like, you know, he's soaked up that atmosphere, but again, [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4361.94s)]
*  he's like a minor player. He's not, it's not like Netanyahu. Netanyahu was like living practically [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4368.42s)]
*  in APAC headquarters when he was opposition leader and he was figuring out how to work [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4375.62s)]
*  Congress at every level. He was raised in the U S. They just have no one who can replace him [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4381.3s)]
*  in his presence. And then you got these Benny Gantz characters who are just like these blood [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4386.58s)]
*  soaked killers who are like, you know, we must liquidate the Arab. You know, he ran his campaign [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4392.9s)]
*  ad. I don't know if I think you've reported on this at EI, Benny Gantz, former chief of staff [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4403.78s)]
*  of the Israeli army. It's like the most respected position in Israel. His campaign ad was a images [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4408.82s)]
*  of Shadjai, the destroyed neighborhood or area east of Gaza city with statistics on how many [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4414.82s)]
*  people were killed that with Gantz taking credit for it. That was his campaign ad. And it's just [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4421.86s)]
*  like, you just see rubble. Right. That's right. Sending them back to the stone age. Exactly. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4427.219999999999s)]
*  So there's not going to be some great liberal Zionist deliverance. I think it's refreshing to [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4432.82s)]
*  see Netanyahu go and someone even crazier come into come into come into power or a collection [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4437.94s)]
*  of just complete whack jobs because it doesn't change anything about the trajectory of apartheid [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4447.139999999999s)]
*  Israel, except that it's more exposed and without someone like Trump in office to basically roll out [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4457.62s)]
*  the red carpet and enact the deal of the century, you're going to have tension. And the tension is [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4467.14s)]
*  really clear. I mean, you can say Biden took $3.2 million from the Israel lobby in the Senate. He [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4474.0199999999995s)]
*  said that if we didn't have Israel, we'd have to create it. It's all true. But Biden's constituency [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4480.42s)]
*  is people who are like, they kind of want to be decent people. They have those signs on their lawn [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4487.3s)]
*  that's in front of their houses that say like, we believe in science. Love is love. All people are [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4493.860000000001s)]
*  welcome here. We love refugees and we like anoint the sores on their feet. They don't support this [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB0zafEJqtw&t=4503.9400000000005s)]
