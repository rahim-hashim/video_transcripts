# Students fight escalating repression on US campuses
**The Electronic Intifada:** [April 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18)
*  Hello and welcome back to the Electronic Intifada podcast. I'm Nora Barrows-Freedman. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=0.0s)]
*  Across the U.S., students are mobilizing in defense of Palestinian rights and in direct [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=7.48s)]
*  opposition to their university administration's relationships with Israeli institutions and [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=12.6s)]
*  investments in corporations that aid and abet Israel's genocide in Gaza. Israel lobby groups [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=18.52s)]
*  have mounted escalating attacks on students who support Palestinian liberation and have worked [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=27.0s)]
*  with university administrations to crack down on student activism and speech. At the end of October [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=32.52s)]
*  last year, when Israel's genocidal attacks on Gaza were already in full swing, the Anti-Defamation [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=38.96s)]
*  League and the Louis D. Brandeis Center, two of the top right-wing Israel lobby and lawfare groups [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=44.92s)]
*  masquerading as civil rights organizations, sent letters to hundreds of U.S. universities urging [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  administrators to, quote, immediately investigate their campus chapters of Students for Justice in [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=58.64s)]
*  Palestine over, quote, potential violations of the prohibition against materially supporting a [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=64.48s)]
*  foreign terrorist organization. Just a few weeks ago, the ADL's director, Jonathan Greenblatt, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=70.75999999999999s)]
*  compared the Palestinian kafia, the traditional scarf worn by Palestinians and people around the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=77.80000000000001s)]
*  world who support Palestinians, to the Nazi swastika on national TV without any pushback [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=83.48s)]
*  by the television hosts. Earlier this year, the Columbia University administration suspended the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=89.4s)]
*  campus chapters of Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace. And then [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=96.28s)]
*  in early April, after students organized an event focused on Palestine, the administration suspended [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=101.68s)]
*  five students and issued eviction orders from student housing with only 24 hours notice. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=107.92s)]
*  At Pomona University in Southern California in early April, the Guardian reported that 18 students [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=115.12s)]
*  were arrested and charged with misdemeanor trespassing and one student was arrested for [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=122.0s)]
*  obstruction of justice, according to the Claremont Police Department, during a protest in response to [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=127.12s)]
*  the removal of pro-Palestinian art on the college campus. Students were led away by dozens of cops [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=133.36s)]
*  in riot gear. The Guardian added that at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, at the same [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=140.32s)]
*  time, three students were expelled, one suspended, and 20 were given probation over their involvement [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=146.72s)]
*  in a sit-in protest on March 27th for Palestine at the campus' Kirkland Hall. The protest was in [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=153.04s)]
*  response to the school administration removing an Israel divestment question from student ballots. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=160.4s)]
*  And repression by administrators at Harvard has reached unprecedented levels, students say, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=166.79999999999998s)]
*  where every Palestine-related event is under intense scrutiny by the administration [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=173.2s)]
*  and student leaders have been evicted and investigated by the university. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=178.4s)]
*  In February, the MIT administration suspended the Coalition Against Apartheid for fighting [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=183.28s)]
*  for Palestinian liberation. They have further issued sanctions letters to 13 student organizers, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=189.12s)]
*  threatening them with permanent suspension from MIT. And at the University of Pennsylvania, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=195.92s)]
*  students faced possible administrative discipline for screening a documentary on Zionism. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  There are so many other instances across the US on college campuses it's hard to keep up, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=208.0s)]
*  but joining us today are four students from Harvard, Columbia, MIT, and the University of [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=213.35999999999999s)]
*  Pennsylvania. Safiya Ogundipe is a senior at MIT studying chemical biological engineering and has [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=218.48s)]
*  been an organizer with the MIT Coalition Against Apartheid since 2021. Leah Cagli is a student [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=226.16s)]
*  organizer at Harvard Law School and community organizer with the Palestinian youth movement in [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=233.68s)]
*  Boston. Her family is from the occupied interior of Palestine. They were exiled in 1948. We have [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=238.88s)]
*  Sabira from the University of Pennsylvania, who is in her junior year and has been a part of the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=245.76000000000002s)]
*  fight in advocating for Palestine on her campus. And Kay from Columbia, who wishes to remain [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=251.04000000000002s)]
*  anonymous because of the mounting attacks, both from the administration and Israel-aligned groups. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=257.04s)]
*  Welcome all of you to the Electronic into Photo podcast. Thanks for being here. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=263.2s)]
*  Thanks for having us. So I want to go around and have you each lay out what's been happening on [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=267.68s)]
*  your campuses in terms of both Israel lobby repression, administrative repression, and how [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=274.0s)]
*  students have been organizing to fight back. Leah, let's begin by having you talk about what's been [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=280.32s)]
*  happening at Harvard Law School. Sure. So I go to Harvard Law School and in coalition with students [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=285.68s)]
*  at the other Harvard campuses. We've been organizing since October against the genocide on our campuses [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=294.32s)]
*  and have seen severe repression from the university. As you mentioned, friends of mine have been [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=303.28000000000003s)]
*  removed from their housing, from their positions of employment from the university, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=309.84000000000003s)]
*  have faced investigation both by law enforcement and by the university police. And so we've seen [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=314.4s)]
*  real escalations in response to oftentimes very mild protests. You know, I'm myself under [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=321.91999999999996s)]
*  investigation by the Disciplinary Board of the Law School. So just in response to speaking in the [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=331.35999999999996s)]
*  student lounge at our school. So we've seen like that even this, you know, extreme level of repression [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=337.35999999999996s)]
*  against, you know, the most mild of dissents. And I really think the reason for that is because [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=343.68s)]
*  these institutions, and I'll just speak to Harvard in particular, are deeply embedded in and bought [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=350.56s)]
*  into the death cult of Zionism. And so I think when we talk about repression and when you look [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=356.64s)]
*  at the picture of Harvard in particular, the intervention I think is important for people [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=363.12s)]
*  to understand and that I would want to make here is that, you know, Harvard is invested not just [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=367.6s)]
*  materially, financially, but academically and intellectually in the project of Zionism in a way [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=373.92s)]
*  that sort of leaves them no choice but to, you know, cow to every Zionist attack that we've seen [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=379.20000000000005s)]
*  happen in the last six months. And, you know, you could take any one of the thousands, tens of [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=386.64000000000004s)]
*  thousands, hundreds of thousands of catastrophes that have been wrought upon my people. And if you [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=392.88s)]
*  were to trace it back, you know, you would see Harvard's fingerprints all over it. A friend of [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=396.56s)]
*  mine recently told me the story of his, you know, childhood friend whose son was martyred after just, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=401.28000000000003s)]
*  you know, going to his room to pick up his toys and then that particular room was struck by a [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=409.84000000000003s)]
*  bomb. And because it was in the area of the Ashippa Medical Complex, that family couldn't leave their [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=414.16s)]
*  home and was forced to be in the room with their son's rotting body for four days. If you take [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=419.44s)]
*  even just this one example of something that feels personal to me through a friend, you know, you [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=426.47999999999996s)]
*  think about the bomb that was dropped might have been an Elbit Hermes drone and Elbit is poaching [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=430.56s)]
*  employees from Harvard. You think about the Israeli military officials who okayed that [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=436.96s)]
*  bomb and they maybe are people who are beneficiaries of the Wexner Fellowship at Harvard. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=443.03999999999996s)]
*  Then you look at the American side, the politicians that approve those sort of targeted killings and, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=448.71999999999997s)]
*  you know, allow for the military budgets and military funding packages to go through, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=455.12s)]
*  statistically any large number of them are Ivy League educated, including at Harvard, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=461.68s)]
*  Anthony Blinken, obviously being an example of someone who went to Harvard. And so I just [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=466.48s)]
*  mentioned that to say that when we look at the level of repression that students are facing on [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=471.12s)]
*  campus, we can see that it is because of Harvard's investment, which is why our demand as student [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=475.2s)]
*  organizers has been divest, but also to think of divestment expansively, not only in the way that [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=481.52s)]
*  all capital is often invested in genocide, being raw upon my people, but also the way that Harvard [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=487.28s)]
*  has provided political and intellectual cover for Zionism as it continues to commit these crimes [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=493.91999999999996s)]
*  for the last six months. So that's really been what our organizing has been centered around. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=499.52s)]
*  We did pass a divestment resolution at the law school and they have been following at [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=503.28s)]
*  other graduate schools at Harvard. The undergraduate recently tried to put a divestment bill [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=507.36s)]
*  forward and it was actually blocked by just a few Zionist forces in the administration and student [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=513.84s)]
*  government, very undemocratically. So we're seeing this repression happen to students and it's really [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=519.44s)]
*  because of the investments that Harvard has, which is why our call remains to divest materially and [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=526.0s)]
*  academically from Zionism. Phenomenal. Thank you so much, Leah. Sophia, you're very close to [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=532.08s)]
*  where Leah goes to school at MIT. You're a senior there. You've been organizing for several years. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=540.48s)]
*  Talk about what's happening at MIT. I mean, you know, it's just, I mean, and all four of you are [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=547.6800000000001s)]
*  students of very elite, you know, Ivy League institutions that purport to be, you know, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=554.64s)]
*  beacons of academic freedom and democratic thought. And, you know, what has it been like [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=561.92s)]
*  organizing for Palestine on MIT's campus? What have you been facing? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=570.4s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Thank you so much for having me. And yeah, on the sort of idea of these colleges, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=576.64s)]
*  espousing these sorts of values, I think at MIT, when you walk into like lobby seven, which is [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=583.84s)]
*  like our main lobby, there are these like giant banners that like show like MIT's values. I think [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=589.28s)]
*  it's like belonging, curiosity, something like that, which is interesting because when we had [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=593.92s)]
*  a protest there in November, the administration's response to our, you know, curiosity and our sense [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=599.04s)]
*  of community was to threaten almost a hundred students in there with suspensions. So obviously [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=606.5600000000001s)]
*  there's a bit of a hypocritical element to the image that these institutions like to [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=612.4s)]
*  purport about themselves and what they're actually doing. Yeah. In terms of organizing at MIT, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=617.76s)]
*  we're actually, so we've been, you know, doing things around genocide since October. We put out [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=624.64s)]
*  a statement pretty early on, engaged in some of the Boston area protests and then started having [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=631.1999999999999s)]
*  protests on our own campus. I think a lot of our campaign at MIT, just given the like, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=637.28s)]
*  the technical nature of MIT and how embedded we are in like producing technology for not only [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=643.8399999999999s)]
*  with the US foreign machine, but for Israel has been focusing on those research and technology ties. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=649.76s)]
*  So right now we have been really looking at MIT's research relationships with Israel. So MIT [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=656.0799999999999s)]
*  receives millions of dollars in research funding from the Israeli ministry of defense, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=665.52s)]
*  like directly from the Israeli ministry of defense. Like you go onto like our like vice president [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=670.88s)]
*  of research, you go onto like the report they put out at the end of each year. And it's literally [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=676.88s)]
*  the Israeli ministry of defense is like giving money to researchers, to faculty at MIT to do [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=681.1999999999999s)]
*  projects. And these are not innocent projects. I mean, they wouldn't be innocent regardless, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=687.36s)]
*  like we're talking like autonomous robotics forms, we're talking underwater persistent [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=691.04s)]
*  monitoring. And this is money that is coming directly from the Zionist entity through the [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=695.76s)]
*  department of defense in the US and then into MIT. And these researchers are doing these projects [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=700.24s)]
*  with that funding. And so there's this very explicit relationship that MIT has where we are [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=706.64s)]
*  producing like the technological capabilities, both through research that is directly funded by [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=713.76s)]
*  the Israeli entity, but also just generally like we have so much technology, so much of MIT is [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=719.36s)]
*  funded by the department of defense. And a lot of that technology will still end up benefiting [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=724.88s)]
*  the Zionist entity. And so that is something we've been focusing on a lot at MIT is how do we as [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=730.08s)]
*  students and workers, so both undergraduates, a lot of undergraduates do research, but grad workers [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=735.6800000000001s)]
*  especially do a lot of research. How do we kind of take back that power and say like, no, we're not [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=740.88s)]
*  going to allow our labor to be used for genocide, to be used for occupation. So we released this [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=745.76s)]
*  scientist against apartheid pledge. I think right now we have over a thousand people signed onto it. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=751.76s)]
*  That includes about 500 undergraduates, which is like 12% of the undergraduate population at MIT, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=758.0s)]
*  which is great. And it's really just about like saying to the Institute, like, you know, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=765.12s)]
*  no, you cannot use this labor force to continue to push this project of Zionism out into the world. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=771.44s)]
*  And so that's one campaign we've been doing, another campaign that we've been looking at, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=778.24s)]
*  because I mean, MIT just has so much complexity is also another issue. That was something we [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=782.64s)]
*  always struggled with even before October 7th is like, what do we focus on? And I think the [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=787.12s)]
*  Israeli Ministry of Defense funding was one thing that we really wanted to hit on. The second one [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=791.9200000000001s)]
*  was this Lockheed Martin seed fund for Israel that faculty can apply for, where they can [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=796.48s)]
*  collaborate with a researcher in the Israeli, in Israel to basically just, you know, start some [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=803.12s)]
*  sort of seed project. The money comes from Lockheed Martin. They prioritize projects that work with [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=810.0s)]
*  UAVs, that work with quantum sensing, all of the sorts of things that Lockheed Martin would want. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=816.16s)]
*  And it's been really interesting campaigning against this specific fund because we've been [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=821.76s)]
*  accused of, oh, they're targeting the manager of this fund because he's Israeli. And so now we're [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=825.36s)]
*  going to investigate you guys on anti-Semitism and on harassment based on protected class, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=830.08s)]
*  which are the charges that I'm currently dealing with. You have the people who like manage the [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=835.04s)]
*  fund claiming like, oh, it's not a fund of war or of genocide. It's actually a fund for climate [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=842.64s)]
*  change. The projects that we choose are for climate change. And so then you have this like [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=850.32s)]
*  Green Washington fund that is funded by Lockheed Martin to do research with Israeli researchers [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=853.52s)]
*  that prioritizes fields such as UAVs and quantum sensing. They're going to tell us it's a climate [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=860.0799999999999s)]
*  fund. And so there's this kind of culture at MIT that we're also kind of pushing against [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=865.12s)]
*  that is kind of unique because we're such an engineering and technology heavy school. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=870.8s)]
*  And so I think it's been really interesting to see students push back on just our overall culture, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=875.68s)]
*  not just with our relationship to Zionists, but our relationship to war and genocide throughout. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=880.48s)]
*  But in terms of oppression, so as you kind of mentioned, we had a rally in February. It was [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=886.72s)]
*  right after some attacks in Raqqa, February 11th, February 12th, somewhere around there. And so we [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=897.28s)]
*  had an emergency rally. And MIT basically, after that rally, they suspended the CIA and they sent [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=902.32s)]
*  sanction letters to 13 organizers. We managed to get a drop down to eight eventually, basically [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=910.0s)]
*  saying you break another rule, we will have grounds to permanently suspend you. And that was kind of [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=915.9200000000001s)]
*  interesting because we're also dealing with this sort of new protest policy that's been rolled out [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=922.72s)]
*  this year, which is basically that you have to register your protests, like three business days [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=927.44s)]
*  in advance, you have to like pick one of these approved protest locations and they so conveniently [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=932.08s)]
*  dropped the list of approved protest locations the day before we were about to have a protest in a [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=937.36s)]
*  non-approved protest location. So we're also kind of dealing with that side of things of, you know, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=941.44s)]
*  how do we continue to push back against this protest policy? Because this is not something [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=948.4000000000001s)]
*  that will just affect us. If we allow this new protest policy to stay in effect without any sort [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=952.4s)]
*  pressure against it, like that's going to affect student activists going forward. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=958.9599999999999s)]
*  But yeah, in terms of repression, so there are the sanction letters, which actually the sanction [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=964.48s)]
*  letters that came after the Raqqa rally, we actually managed to basically clear, they've kind of [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=968.56s)]
*  gotten rid of those, which are good. But we still have seven students under investigation from back [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=973.76s)]
*  in January, myself included, for a protest that we did against that Lockheed Martin fund that I was [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=978.88s)]
*  talking about earlier. That protest was in November and then we got the sanction letters in January, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=984.32s)]
*  like a day after Claudine Gay resigned from Harvard. And there have been a couple of instances [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=989.68s)]
*  where we'll see an instance of repression on our campus very soon after something else happens on [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=995.68s)]
*  another campus and they'll always tell us it's not related, but you know, we know that administrators [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1000.72s)]
*  talk just like we talk. So yeah, that's the main thing that we're dealing with. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1005.28s)]
*  We've had some instances relating to the police, luckily nothing to the level that we're seeing at [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1011.8399999999999s)]
*  you know, Pomona or even locally at Brandeis. We've kind of been following those and our hearts are [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1018.24s)]
*  with those students who are kind of facing that level of brutality. But there has been like [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1022.88s)]
*  increased police presence on campus. There's a police officer stationed in lobby seven in that [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1027.2s)]
*  main lobby that I mentioned. He's stationed there all day, every day, every weekday. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1032.24s)]
*  We had a teach-in back in the fall semester that was totally registered, totally just a [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1038.48s)]
*  purely educational event. They ended up locking the doors and staging three police officers in [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1043.36s)]
*  front of it right after the protest that we had. And they had, they really gave no justification [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1047.84s)]
*  as to why they did that. Of course, we know why they did that. They basically just wanted to shut [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1052.8s)]
*  us up after that protest that we had in November. But I think police presence is also something that [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1056.48s)]
*  is really galvanizing the student base at MIT because you know, groups like the Black Students [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1062.48s)]
*  Union and the Black Graduate Student Association have been fighting for years to try to reduce the [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1068.24s)]
*  level of police presence at MIT and get rid of cops in emergency situations on campus. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1073.04s)]
*  And basically all it took was a couple of scientists students to complain about our protest. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1079.76s)]
*  And now there are cops everywhere. There's cops by the religious activity center. There's a cop [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1084.48s)]
*  station in lobby seven. There's just way more cop presence on campus. And so it's kind of interesting [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1088.16s)]
*  to see which student voices get that the administration immediately responds to. Because [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1095.68s)]
*  like I said, almost every community of color has complained about the cops before. We had whole [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1101.44s)]
*  committees that they put these students through to come up with these recommendations [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1107.1200000000001s)]
*  to try to reduce the presence of cops on campus. And it took the span of like three months for that [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1111.0400000000002s)]
*  to be completely undone and then some because of scientists students who want to watch our protest. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1116.48s)]
*  And so we're seeing these connections between not just people who are struggling for Palestine, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1122.4s)]
*  but also a lot of the struggles that like Black students and other students of color [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1127.3600000000001s)]
*  have been fighting for on campus. And so I don't know, it's been interesting. Obviously, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1131.28s)]
*  the repression is not great, but it has been a really good opportunity to serve coalition [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1136.64s)]
*  built in a very material way and in a very real way that I don't think has existed on campus before. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1142.0s)]
*  And I think admin is not quite ready for the level of students cooperation that they're probably [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1148.16s)]
*  going to have to deal with for the next couple of years. Yeah, absolutely. Thanks, Sophia. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1154.8s)]
*  Sabira, you're at the University of Pennsylvania. Tell us what's been happening there in terms of [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1161.36s)]
*  both student activism around the genocide in Gaza and also administrative repression. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1168.08s)]
*  Yeah, thank you so much for having me and then also for everyone who spoke before. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1178.08s)]
*  It's interesting because a lot of these themes and acts of suppression have been just present [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1184.3999999999999s)]
*  on our campus as well. It definitely seems that like, you know, all of our suppression and repression [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1190.96s)]
*  are interconnected, especially on the front of over policing, targeting of students for just the [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1197.84s)]
*  premise of being pro-Palestine, especially because Penn started to get a lot of the heat [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1208.3999999999999s)]
*  after Harvard, after other schools. We were able to protect ourselves in very, you know, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1215.76s)]
*  cautious manners, especially as our comrades and fellow organizers from Harvard got a lot of the [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1224.88s)]
*  brunt of the violence. Penn Against Occupation, the main SJP-adjacent group on campus, had released [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1231.5200000000002s)]
*  a statement very soon after the acts of resilience on October 7th. And many student groups had signed [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1240.0800000000002s)]
*  on, but considering the doxing that happened at Harvard, obviously many students had to [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1250.3999999999999s)]
*  protect themselves and obviously, you know, not risk their entire safety. Many students, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1254.8s)]
*  especially undocumented students on our campus, have been specifically doxed or put in very [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1264.1599999999999s)]
*  uncomfortable situations. It's very interesting on our campus. It's actually not just been [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1268.96s)]
*  the university that has put students in uncomfortable positions, but students themselves have, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1274.08s)]
*  especially from the Zionist student groups and spaces on campus. Specifically for myself, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1281.76s)]
*  I've been studying abroad for the last year and haven't been able to physically be on the ground [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1289.84s)]
*  to actually advocate and organize. But being someone who is concerned and especially like [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1294.08s)]
*  very, very shocked about the response from my university community about the genocide happening [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1300.0800000000002s)]
*  in Gaza, that's undeniably a genocide. Students have been preying on each other's social media, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1307.52s)]
*  talking to each other, particularly from the Zionist community, in order to actually attack [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1314.96s)]
*  and give names and identify students, even if they aren't directly a part of student groups, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1320.5600000000002s)]
*  which is really concerning considering that although I haven't been on campus to specifically [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1326.5600000000002s)]
*  organize, my name was added onto a list of students that were put on Canary Mission, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1331.68s)]
*  amongst other websites, and have faced like violent threats, threats to my own family, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1336.8s)]
*  as young as like my six-year-old cousins being given very violent threats, which is unjust. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1343.68s)]
*  The university still hasn't responded to that, which is really, really concerning. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1350.8000000000002s)]
*  Similar to Safia, it's very interesting because Zionist students have been able to complain that [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1356.5600000000002s)]
*  they have felt uncomfortable by mere acts of saying, free Palestine or let Gaza live, very [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1363.3600000000001s)]
*  simple. Well, free Palestine has been controversial, but let Gaza live, of people living [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1370.88s)]
*  in their home, which shouldn't be controversial. It has caused a very easy way for the disciplinary [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1379.28s)]
*  committee at Penn to just get names of students and force a disciplinary case on them, as many [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1387.52s)]
*  of the Zionist students who have been very loud and proud of the growing anti-Semitism on our campus [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1396.16s)]
*  by scapegoating specific students, specific groups, specific actions, to the smallest extent [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1403.8400000000001s)]
*  to give students disciplinary cases. One of which was really concerning, that was students have been [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1409.92s)]
*  identified from mere security footage for putting on sticker, putting stickers on, you know, polls [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1416.48s)]
*  on campus that say, free Palestine, let Gaza live, simple, you know, slogans and, you know, statements. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1423.3600000000001s)]
*  And students have been given disciplinary cases by that, just by identifying them due to specific [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1431.68s)]
*  like clothes that they have worn repeatedly. The university definitely has cracked down on certain [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1438.0s)]
*  students and is not willing to discriminate those students based on simple actions. There's actually [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1444.88s)]
*  been a very concerning situation that happened recently where students were simply chalking [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1450.3200000000002s)]
*  on campus and act of chalking is used by many student groups, you know, to promote upcoming [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1456.24s)]
*  shows, you know, promote, you know, elections that are happening, anything like that. But students, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1461.36s)]
*  a part of the pro-Palestine groups on our campus, were swarmed by six to eight campus police officers [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1467.84s)]
*  and detained, you know, unjustifiably for 30 minutes until other students had shown up in solidarity [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1473.76s)]
*  to just say like, what is the issue? Campus security wouldn't have, wouldn't budge and they [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1481.6s)]
*  were asking for identification, but knowing our rights as students, saying that we're violating and [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1490.4s)]
*  like damaging the school property, the property that we pay for, by the way, it was spray chalk, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1498.88s)]
*  you know, you can just pour water on it and it'll be gone. You know, detaining students on their [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1504.48s)]
*  campus, that's very unsafe. And even after this, students were followed home. That's very dangerous [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1510.64s)]
*  about like, you know, considering on Penn's campus, students are required to live on campus [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1517.2s)]
*  for two years. Our home is our campus and if we're followed home, how can you be safe? [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1521.52s)]
*  Especially considering the growing disciplinary cases of students being rejected housing, [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1526.88s)]
*  like losing their housing because of their advocacy. Are we students or are we just, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1533.28s)]
*  you know, pawns to the liberal agenda of what seems like liberal education? Which I find really [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1537.68s)]
*  concerning. I didn't mention when I studied, but I do study Middle Eastern politics. And there have [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1545.12s)]
*  been cases where students in classes have specifically been called out and been reported [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1551.52s)]
*  to disciplinary cases based on something they said in class. If we in our classrooms can't feel safe [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1556.2399999999998s)]
*  to speak our mind, to call it a genocide, what it is to say that Palestinians deserve the right to [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1561.12s)]
*  live, to talk about the right of resistance, the right to freedom and, you know, all these liberal [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1567.28s)]
*  ideas that we all talk about every single day. You know, we talk about South Africa, we talk about all [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1578.8799999999999s)]
*  these different liberation, liberty movements, especially on our campus. You know, Penn is [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1584.96s)]
*  in the bottom of Philadelphia and we have indigenous acknowledgments and talking about [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1591.76s)]
*  the Black people who are displaced and ongoingly displaced in our community. But if we talk about [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1597.76s)]
*  these lofty ideals but actually can't act on them during an actual genocide, it's really concerning [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1603.84s)]
*  considering also Penn has a direct relation with, you know, certain programs in the West Bank where [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1608.8s)]
*  students from Palestine actually are a part of our community. This isn't a separate idea where [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1615.52s)]
*  students, like there are no Palestinian students on our campus, but there are just only Palestinians [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1620.48s)]
*  from the diaspora. There are actually Palestinian students from Palestine on our campus that are [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1626.0800000000002s)]
*  suffering, being scared and put into silence who lack support and it's really concerning. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1630.96s)]
*  But yeah, it's been a very wide-ranging idea of disciplinary cases where a really concerning [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1639.76s)]
*  recent instance was when through a very mild act of resistance, a study in where students had just [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1646.08s)]
*  booked a GSR or study room in our main library, we only put flags and banners alongside the walls so [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1654.48s)]
*  people could obviously not pretend that they're in a world that a genocide isn't occurring to keep [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1663.1999999999998s)]
*  their awareness running. Students were studying silently and during the study session, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1669.28s)]
*  administration had come to the room to ask for the flyers and the banners and the flags to be [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1676.48s)]
*  taken down. Students had complied, but despite this, students during that study in are now facing [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1680.8799999999999s)]
*  escalated disciplinary hearings that are not just solved by what normally happens is an essay kind [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1687.44s)]
*  of talking about the situation, but now they're being forced into a hearing to actually talk about [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1695.92s)]
*  the seriousness of just studying in a room and having a flag up just because some Zionist [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1701.8400000000001s)]
*  students were complaining about how it made them uncomfortable. The reality of the situation is [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1706.48s)]
*  that PEN is not absolved from the hands of the violence and from the West Bank to Gaza to the [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1710.8000000000002s)]
*  pre-1948 territories. PEN actively manufactures, innovates, engineers the newest technology used [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1717.92s)]
*  to police, surveil, and you know murder innocent Palestinians in the homeland. Recently a new [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1727.76s)]
*  campaign that's been going on is to target PENovation that actually is famously known for [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1735.92s)]
*  engineering the robotic war dogs. I don't know the specific language, but they're known for [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1742.48s)]
*  having engineered the robotic dogs that are used to monitor and surveil Palestinians. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1752.4s)]
*  Although this has been a larger campaign not just on our campus, but from the entire concerned [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1760.24s)]
*  Philadelphia community, the university has specifically barred from our main SJP group, [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1764.64s)]
*  PEN against occupation, from endorsing this action because it risks most like similarly to [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1771.76s)]
*  other campuses our recognition as a student society because if we are able to endorse this [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1777.6s)]
*  action we're suddenly going against campus violations. But last time I checked advocating [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1784.24s)]
*  and standing in our grounds for our values, I don't know how that's against university violation [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1790.8799999999999s)]
*  when we have six and more Zionist groups and they're able to blatantly call students [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1798.72s)]
*  advocacy groups anti-Semitic for advocating for Palestinians or just deny the genocide outwardly. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1808.72s)]
*  There have been a lot of occurrences that have been really concerning including like a recent [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1818.88s)]
*  leaked chat of Zionist students calling organizers and attendees of a Palestine protest animals [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1825.28s)]
*  that they wish threats and harm upon students that were there. This was leaked with their names [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1832.72s)]
*  and administration has lacked to act on that. So there are a lot of different instances that are [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1840.48s)]
*  really concerning not just about administration repressing students and advocacy but other [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1844.96s)]
*  students themselves inflicting harm on other students and it's really difficult because a [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1849.52s)]
*  lot of our campus are sympathetic and aware of the genocide but because of the strong voices of the [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1855.04s)]
*  you know the Zionist community at PEN a lot of students have been forced into [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1864.48s)]
*  silence have been unable to advocate for themselves advocate for Palestine to feel proud and [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1868.8s)]
*  you know proud like Palestinian students to be proud of their Palestinian identity. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1876.08s)]
*  Many of them who have removed themselves from the from the entire genocide because they're [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1881.6799999999998s)]
*  afraid of being targeted. It's it causes this really difficult witch hunt on campus. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1888.24s)]
*  Yeah absolutely. Thank you so much Sabira. And Kay you're at Columbia University. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1897.3600000000001s)]
*  Since January there have been just I mean the most like egregious attack there was an actual [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1906.32s)]
*  chemical attack on students by former members of the Israeli military. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1913.2s)]
*  Quite a story in itself you also have a very anti-Palestinian professor Shai Davide who has [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1918.32s)]
*  been doxing and attacking students and has yet to face any administrative sanctions or [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1923.84s)]
*  discipline at all and now the university has evicted and suspended students involved in [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1930.6399999999999s)]
*  Palestine organizing. Walk us through the last you know four to six months on Columbia University [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1935.6799999999998s)]
*  campus. Right so repression in Columbia has been just been so crazy where it's like I have tried [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1943.1999999999998s)]
*  to remember everything that's happened and I'm still like forgetting certain things like even [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1949.44s)]
*  like the like the attack from January that was like a lot of times like around when we're talking [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1952.64s)]
*  when I was talking like my fellow organizers at Columbia we like sometimes forget that happened [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1958.8s)]
*  even like the students who were like victims of it like there's so much to happen there's just like [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1962.56s)]
*  we just forget about it but yeah so most of the repression that we're getting like we're facing [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1967.8400000000001s)]
*  massive repression from the administration mostly because of the way that we're dealing with it. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1973.6000000000001s)]
*  So we're getting repression from the administration mostly because you know President [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1978.0s)]
*  Manushafik is going to be appearing at Congress soon this week and she was charged by the [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1981.28s)]
*  education committee of not like properly dealing with campus anti-Semitism which is you know just [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1987.12s)]
*  a cold word for active for Palestine student organizing because here on the Columbia campus [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1992.96s)]
*  is we've really been active across all different schools across the undergraduate and graduate [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=1998.08s)]
*  and just to start one thing that happened I don't know if this was very publicized but [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2003.8400000000001s)]
*  we had some pro-Palestine law students who hold a vigil in their cafeteria and that escalated to [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2010.0800000000002s)]
*  the the administration demonizing these students as anti-Semitic simply because some Zionists [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2015.6000000000001s)]
*  overheard them reading out the names of martyrs that is literally the entire issue they said a [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2021.1200000000001s)]
*  vigil was anti-Semitic and so another thing is the university also publicized and demonized a [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2025.84s)]
*  post that Quad posted on their Instagram story and this only happened because of Zionist outrage [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2033.12s)]
*  and so another thing that also happened is the university launched disciplinary cases [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2039.04s)]
*  against students who had passed up pamphlets that concerned the university's trustees you know [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2043.4399999999998s)]
*  basically saying how each trustee their role at Columbia and how they their relationship to [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2048.72s)]
*  Zionism and so most of these trustees are not Jewish but these the pamphlets were misconstrued [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2054.96s)]
*  as anti-Semitic by Zionists and that's why the university launched these disciplinary cases [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2060.96s)]
*  against these students who gave them out and they even like targeted they even targeted random [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2065.36s)]
*  students who had nothing to do with these pamphlets who were not involved in the passing out or the [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2072.08s)]
*  making of these pamphlets at all but I think with the turning point here at Columbia is that the [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2076.64s)]
*  fact that the university hired a COO the first in its history to deal with us and that's led to [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2082.96s)]
*  really ridiculous tactics such as one emailing all these student groups and Columbia University [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2088.56s)]
*  apartheid divest which is a coalition of over 100 groups and so the administration emailed these [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2093.52s)]
*  student group leaders with threats of associating with us basically saying this group is doing so [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2101.28s)]
*  and so that we determined is like violent and unsafe and anti-Semitic and this is all an effort [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2107.36s)]
*  to get these student groups to disfilly with us basically to make our coalition crumble [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2113.6s)]
*  it's really all just an effort to destroy the movement the student movement that we have going [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2120.08s)]
*  here. What is the C sorry what does the COO stand for? The chief operating officer I believe. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2124.56s)]
*  Okay yeah so but it's but it's but that person has been hired specifically to monitor [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2133.2s)]
*  Palestine solidarity organizers. They don't say so publicly but in all of these threats that I'm [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2140.08s)]
*  detailing even like the threats against the students that got that got them suspended his [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2145.9199999999996s)]
*  that person's name was on every email so we basically think that they were hired [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2151.6s)]
*  to basically get Manushafiq to keep her job. Another instance is the university also attempted [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2156.9599999999996s)]
*  to intimidate students out of attempting a legitimate student worker union protected [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2165.12s)]
*  protest before the protest occurred as well as after where they sent threatening confusing [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2169.8399999999997s)]
*  letters to render so they could identify from mass surveillance on campus which they do through [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2175.12s)]
*  public safety following students around through cameras that they've a lot they place new cameras [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2180.56s)]
*  around campus as well and they've also every time there's like a protest or any kind of like [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2186.56s)]
*  pro-palestine activity what they do is they close gates what that means is that if you can only like [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2191.52s)]
*  go onto campus if you have a Columbia ID because usually you can just go on campus no questions [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2196.96s)]
*  asked so when you go onto campus when the gates are closed you have to tap your ID on an electric [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2203.04s)]
*  scanner and so the university uses that to identify students who are coming and going [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2208.0s)]
*  that is also part of their mass surveillance on campus and that's how they were able to identify [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2213.68s)]
*  students who attended this protest and like be able to send them letters so the threatening [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2219.12s)]
*  letters but that's only for Columbia at Barnard students actually got notices for disciplinary [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2225.2s)]
*  uh like meetings with their deans or whatever for a disciplinary process for attending this [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2231.76s)]
*  these protests simply because Barnard College which is affiliated with Columbia [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2239.92s)]
*  it's taking its own university is quite more harsh against protests students who go to [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2243.36s)]
*  it's who attend protests either on Columbia campus or on Barnard campus and one thing I'd like to [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2250.96s)]
*  clarify is that this is all a distraction the university does not want to talk about Gaza or [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2257.2799999999997s)]
*  about Palestine at all um instead it wants us it presents these issues in our lives so that we only [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2262.64s)]
*  talk about these issues so you know you won't hear so that you when we go to protest all we're [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2269.04s)]
*  talking about is like the repression instead of like what's going on in Gaza what's going on in [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2273.6s)]
*  Palestine just going on rafa um and that's even just before I talk about the suspensions and [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2277.8399999999997s)]
*  evictions and so what this university is doing is that it's making students homeless and wrecking [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2283.52s)]
*  their education simply for exercising our uh first amendment rights but to make it make it worse [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2288.4s)]
*  in like really to show that this is all a farce is the fact that Manusha Fee quickly made a [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2295.52s)]
*  statement against the suspended students you know quicker than the than when um students were [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2300.32s)]
*  sprayed with the chemical in January um and so in the statement she can caricature them as violent [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2305.44s)]
*  and dangerous basically inviting law enforcement against these students on basis charges and this [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2311.68s)]
*  is quite dangerous because of that majority of our um of our organizers are people of color are black [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2316.0s)]
*  people are Arabs Muslims um and so this is just this university is just shamelessly deciding to [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2322.72s)]
*  engage in um structural racism and Islamophobia um indeed yeah oh go ahead sorry uh so we really [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2331.04s)]
*  see this this is all because of Shafik's um upcoming appearance in front of Congress and [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2341.44s)]
*  this is really her last attempt to show Congress that she's a serious disciplinarian against pro-Palestine [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2347.36s)]
*  students and this is just all some strange effort to keep her job at the expense of the people she's [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2352.64s)]
*  supposed to support and protect and so because this is like unlike any repression we student [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2357.2000000000003s)]
*  organizers have ever faced since October 7th um we think that this is not going to um end well [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2362.8s)]
*  for Columbia's reputation because you know who will want to send their kids to a university that [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2370.96s)]
*  menaces its students like this yeah absolutely um it's just unbelievable i mean just you know the [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2375.1200000000003s)]
*  fact that that students were attacked in an in an incredibly harmful and dangerous way with uh with [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2384.48s)]
*  a chemical spray um in January uh that that i mean i i remember reading the testimony of one of the [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2392.16s)]
*  students who was attacked um and and and she was talking about how it was taking weeks to get the [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2401.68s)]
*  the smell out of her clothes and off of her body and how it was affecting all sorts of uh you know [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2409.7599999999998s)]
*  her health uh for weeks and the and the administration completely ignored it and instead [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2417.36s)]
*  of uh trying to you know find and discipline the people who sprayed these students they just punished [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2422.8s)]
*  the students um it's just uh i mean it you know it's not surprising in a in a certain way when we [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2431.52s)]
*  when we see the decades and decades of university administrations around uh the U.S. and Canada [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2438.96s)]
*  who have willingly thrown their own students under the bus in order to preserve you know their [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2447.52s)]
*  investments in in you know in in Israeli uh companies or U.S. companies that are involved [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2453.04s)]
*  in Israeli occupation or to preserve their relationships with Israeli universities that [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2459.92s)]
*  are involved in like what you were talking about Safia the you know the these these actual material [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2466.08s)]
*  relationships where you know U.S. universities and Israeli universities are working to develop [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2471.44s)]
*  these incredibly lethal and dystopian weapons um so it's not shocking but it is it it's not [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2476.4s)]
*  surprising but it is shocking um that that these administrations are still at this point willing [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2483.6800000000003s)]
*  to throw their students under the bus um in in order to to you know preserve their donors [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2491.04s)]
*  preserve these relationships um it's extraordinary uh yeah Leah you know at Harvard um [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2497.6800000000003s)]
*  how how have and you talked a little bit about this but but how have students been [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2506.0800000000004s)]
*  i mean this this is Harvard Law you know training the next generation of lawyers and and here's like [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2511.44s)]
*  a perfect case study um how has the law students uh student body been uh organizing against this [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2516.88s)]
*  administrative repression and um and what kind of also like you know legal help have you been [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2527.1200000000003s)]
*  getting uh you know there are organizations of course like Palestine Legal like the Center for [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2533.92s)]
*  Constitutional Rights like the ACLU which i know has also been helping um at Columbia uh what kind [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2538.4s)]
*  of student organizing have you been involved in yeah so um i think we've seen that these [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2545.28s)]
*  i can't remember who's speaking about like this idea of protest guidelines we've seen that [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2553.84s)]
*  here at Harvard Law as well um these the concept of protest guidelines has really just become [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2558.56s)]
*  a bludgeon with which these universities can batter dissent and particularly [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2564.56s)]
*  pro-Palestinian dissent um and so you know the problem with trying to uh strangle law students [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2568.8s)]
*  with policy is that we are trained to read and adapt policies so um i think what what uh one of [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2575.92s)]
*  the strategies we took was to sort of try to expose um the the discriminatory enforcement [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2583.28s)]
*  of these policies right so for example um you know we've seen that the every every administrator [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2589.52s)]
*  at Harvard right these are people who are at the height of their careers as um you know academic [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2596.7200000000003s)]
*  administrators right deans things like that all of these people have been deputized to respond to [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2604.88s)]
*  zinus tattletales right so every time there's more than like three people wearing kofi is [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2611.04s)]
*  sitting around in the student lounge talking about Palestine you're almost certainly going to have a [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2616.0s)]
*  dean come down and um tell you that this is not a normal use of space right to uninvite you essentially [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2619.92s)]
*  and so to expose the racism of this one thing that we did was sort of highlight how [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2626.0s)]
*  actually it's very normal for students to be engaging in political conversations to be [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2630.08s)]
*  expressing dissent vocally on campus that's a necessary and critical part of of academic um [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2634.88s)]
*  discourse and so for example um in this main student lounge which has kind of become the [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2642.0s)]
*  contested site of a lot of our organizing at at harvard law uh the women's law student association [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2647.52s)]
*  had like a very benign valentine's card making event in the lounge um and then we had like a [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2653.2799999999997s)]
*  palentine's card making event like a week later uh where people delivered message like wrote [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2658.96s)]
*  messages about the importance of divestment and standing up against the genocide and delivered [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2664.08s)]
*  those to the deans um but that that event you know the deans were sent down to say that we [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2668.0s)]
*  couldn't make we couldn't you know make cards in the space right um and i think it really like [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2673.2s)]
*  these things really expose that there's no adult in the room right there's no adult in these [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2679.6s)]
*  administrative proceedings um people are really just being are bending to the whim of of zionist [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2683.6s)]
*  pressure coming some sometimes just from students from donors um probably from other folks that have [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2691.04s)]
*  influence over harvard um we know obviously congress so all of that is to say that we you [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2697.04s)]
*  know we would do things like this to sort of expose the hypocrisy uh and then what we're seeing is [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2701.92s)]
*  that the university has um taken a really sharp right veer into fascism and has actually suppressed [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2706.16s)]
*  all ability to have organic um you know discourse on campus to have any sort of protest have any [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2715.92s)]
*  sort of event so you know when their their discriminatory enforcement was exposed they said [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2724.4s)]
*  fine no one can use the space except for quiet reflection and study um and so i think these these [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2729.6s)]
*  have been ways that we've tried to show how everyone on campus is a stakeholder in this even if [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2735.6s)]
*  you know while everyone absolutely should be doing something about the genocide even folks whose [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2741.28s)]
*  um you know passions are maybe in another area of social change like we all have an interest in [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2746.48s)]
*  making sure that we're able to have the breathing room to express dissent and change on our campus [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2751.2s)]
*  that we really don't have right now and i think what this shows is that you know these universities [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2757.4399999999996s)]
*  right like uh k mentioned the closing of the gates at columbia that's something that's happened at [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2762.3199999999997s)]
*  harvard too these the gates have been closed and it really exposes the mccarthyist capacity [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2766.72s)]
*  of these academics and institutions um to uh completely disregard all of the values that [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2772.72s)]
*  sephia was talking about right the values of academic freedom and expression um you know [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2779.92s)]
*  diversity and inclusion to just throw those off the table the second it becomes uh inconvenient [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2785.84s)]
*  for them and as soon as it's politically expedient for them to tamp down on all of those students [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2791.12s)]
*  that they're putting on their glossy brochures they'll do that right um so i think you know [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2795.92s)]
*  exposing the discriminatory nature of the policies and the enforcement highlighting how the repression [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2801.28s)]
*  you know we call it the palestinian exception but really it's like you know the area in the coal [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2806.72s)]
*  mine so you know highlighting that repression of palestinian speech is only leading to this [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2810.48s)]
*  you know dystopian reality that we're in where where campus has become this like bizarre quiet [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2815.84s)]
*  zone where no one can can say anything um publicly without facing facing repression uh you know the [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2821.2s)]
*  university wants us to be sort of sequestered into these bookable spaces and um private rooms [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2828.96s)]
*  and studies but you know discourse happens publicly right we are not we all no one is um [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2835.44s)]
*  no one can escape the moral imperative to do something about a genocide and that conversation [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2842.48s)]
*  needs to happen in public it can't happen behind closed doors it can't happen um behind you know [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2846.48s)]
*  room bookings and and so that's a necessary part of of campus discourse um and it's not it's not [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2851.36s)]
*  you know one thing i do also kind of want to problematize it's not the idea of like free [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2858.08s)]
*  speech for the sake of free speech right like we engage in protests and dissents publicly on campus [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2862.16s)]
*  and think that everyone should because we are invested in a different world than the one harvard [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2868.16s)]
*  is invested in we are invested in a world where um all people including my people in palestine can [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2873.44s)]
*  live in freedom and dignity and in liberation in a world where we evade climate uh catastrophe in [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2878.24s)]
*  a world where we don't have a prison and a military industrial complex right all of these things [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2884.7999999999997s)]
*  are things that students are the future that students are invested in but it's not the one [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2889.76s)]
*  harvard's invested in and we're seeing the discrepancy between those investments become [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2893.44s)]
*  really clear um in the way that we've organized on campus thanks leah and yeah kay i want to go back [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2897.84s)]
*  to you because um you know kind of the same question i asked leah like what are the ways [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2905.5200000000004s)]
*  in which uh students are organizing around this like just kind of avalanche of repression [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2913.36s)]
*  on campus um and and how i mean i mentioned the the aclu in new york along with palestine legal [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2920.2400000000002s)]
*  um have uh you know intended sent their intention to columbia saying like what you're do this kind [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2928.7200000000003s)]
*  of repression against students is completely um absurd uh and and violates their basic civil [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2935.6s)]
*  rights um how how are those conversations going and and has that repression uh at columbia um [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2942.64s)]
*  effectively silenced students like has it has it achieved the the effect that the administration [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2952.48s)]
*  and these like very racist zionist uh individuals and and organizations uh want has it has it made [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2958.0s)]
*  students speak out less or uh or what's happened right so i think one thing we've been doing is [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2965.92s)]
*  trying to we have this kind of motto is that uh we keep ourselves safe and so um like first before [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2974.16s)]
*  even we go to even before we like go to like lawyers and stuff like that um we try to make [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2981.6800000000003s)]
*  things safe not just for like each other as student organizers but also like our pro palestine students [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2988.0s)]
*  or pro palestine classmates who are you know not as involved but still really care um and so we try [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=2994.08s)]
*  to like set up like different like small little task force um task force for different things [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3000.24s)]
*  like for example like any kind of if any kind of disciplinary cases goes out against like you know [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3005.84s)]
*  like random students we try to like get in contact with them and give them kind of like tips like um [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3011.36s)]
*  and also like support um and so that's one way we've been trying to keep ourselves safe i would say [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3016.88s)]
*  that the repression has has instilled some fear in us but mostly but it hasn't like silenced us [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3022.08s)]
*  it's just like given us something else to consider when we're like planning things even like the [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3028.64s)]
*  littlest of things like we're like we know that there's going to be a reaction to this even if [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3033.6s)]
*  it's just something very small and so we try to keep that in mind um so i wouldn't say that it [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3037.92s)]
*  has like stopped us or silenced us but it has made things probably more difficult to be an organizer [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3043.84s)]
*  um and so i'd say on the legal front uh we had we do have quite a lot of support from lawyers [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3050.16s)]
*  um but it has been quite frustrating because we feel that they're not you know happening as [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3059.04s)]
*  fast as we want them to or they're not as like effective as we wish they were but we are still [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3063.44s)]
*  trying to you know come at this repression at all angles and that's something that i think has been [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3068.72s)]
*  really important and is probably the one thing that's going to like end this repression [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3074.3199999999997s)]
*  thanks for that uh safiya the the same question to you how are our students organizing um and i [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3080.3199999999997s)]
*  i don't remember uh if if you mentioned there was a sit-in at mit i mean you know it was probably [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3087.6s)]
*  back in november or december feels like it was a decade ago already um but you know has has the [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3093.44s)]
*  has the student body uh you know this 12 that you talked about who who are [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3102.16s)]
*  absolutely against this genocide and against mit's material involvement from [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3109.2799999999997s)]
*  working with with israeli you know weapons contractors how have they been organizing has [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3116.7999999999997s)]
*  have students have yourself i mean you're under investigation yourself what what even does that [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3124.64s)]
*  look like how are you and your your your comrades taking measures to protect yourselves and protect [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3128.8799999999997s)]
*  your academic freedom and protect the right to organize against genocide at mit so there's a [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3136.56s)]
*  couple of components to it um but i'll start with the the sit-in that we had in november um which [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3145.12s)]
*  was interesting because it kind of became it became a larger thing that i think even we were [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3150.56s)]
*  intending it to be basically we were doing this action um it was like one of the first like shut [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3154.88s)]
*  it down for palestine days and so this was our thing that we were going to do for it as well as [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3159.68s)]
*  to bring attention to this lockheed martin fund that i had been talking about um and we were just [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3164.0s)]
*  going to sit in the lobby we had even like we had people like set up to be marshals to prevent [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3167.92s)]
*  to you know to like help safety we agreed that we wouldn't explicitly block anyone from going into [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3173.6s)]
*  the hallway so like a very mundane protest basically for like the first two hours it was [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3178.8s)]
*  just people like sitting and like studying in like the lobby like in this open lobby that like things [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3183.04s)]
*  have happened in mit forever like random musical groups will just like sing in the lobby you know [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3188.24s)]
*  what i mean like it's very much like an open space i had one faculty describe it as like our time [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3194.3199999999997s)]
*  somewhere you know so for them to say that like a protest or not allowed there is like [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3198.72s)]
*  a bit ahistorical um but we had that that sit in um or that you know sort of action and then we had [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3203.68s)]
*  the counter protesters coming in about two um hours in that's what kind of uh caused a lot of [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3210.96s)]
*  the um energy to go up um a lot of uh protesters were i mean a lot of people were you know verbally [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3218.16s)]
*  harassed you know we were shouted like very obscene um and derogatory things um a lot of the [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3225.04s)]
*  women um and them presenting people were shouted at very obscene things a lot of the arab and [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3233.04s)]
*  palestinian students um all the palestinian students that like the zionist students knew [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3238.4s)]
*  like especially the palestinian students from palestine were getting explicit harassment [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3243.04s)]
*  because they knew that they were from palestine like from um yeah they knew they were from palestine [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3247.36s)]
*  um and so all that was happening there was also physical um assaults happening people were being [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3254.1600000000003s)]
*  shoved people were being pushed i knew somebody that got scratched um i knew someone pushed so [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3260.64s)]
*  hard they basically fell down i think my laptop got like smashed that day at some point just [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3265.36s)]
*  because like it was just i don't know there was a lot going on um right and how the administration [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3270.08s)]
*  has even handled the fact that happened and there were so many observers from faculty and admin [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3275.76s)]
*  present that saw that happen and they didn't think to do their own investigation on those students [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3280.96s)]
*  that is another another topic um but basically in response to all that the administration was like [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3285.28s)]
*  okay we need to well actually at a certain point it had kind of calmed down in the sense that we [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3291.68s)]
*  had all gone up the palestinian protesters um just started doing like a very simple picket so we were [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3296.64s)]
*  just kind of marching around the lobby um to keep people moving because at first we were sitting [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3302.24s)]
*  down and like the zionists were literally like stomping near people like it was very much not [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3306.3999999999996s)]
*  going to be safe for people to continue to sit down but we had managed to keep ourselves contained [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3310.0s)]
*  keep ourselves safe like i said we still had people assigned to marshal as we were always going [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3314.48s)]
*  to have um and then the administration came down brought their like lower level advent to like hand [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3318.64s)]
*  out these suspension letters to almost every student in the space um telling them that they [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3324.3199999999997s)]
*  need to leave by like 12 15 or else they would be subject to suspension um at which point the [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3328.48s)]
*  counter protesters left um but we were like you know know where we're going to stay um and as [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3333.2799999999997s)]
*  we're gonna act like the lead organizers we kind of like huddled up in the corner trying to figure [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3338.24s)]
*  out you know like what are the risks here you know what you know what do we want to do after this and [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3341.8399999999997s)]
*  figured like we have enough numbers like we want to stand our ground um and do that and i think [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3346.32s)]
*  that that was um definitely a turning point and it was the first time the mit administration really [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3350.6400000000003s)]
*  tried to go down on the hammer with like repression and it was also the first time that we had really [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3358.6400000000003s)]
*  come back at them and said no we're not going to we're not going to leave um this space and so then [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3362.48s)]
*  more people began to come throughout the day as they found out what was happening both students [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3368.0s)]
*  as well as community members um and we were kind of in like negotiations with admin in the background [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3371.28s)]
*  um because the administration didn't know like we we were we were prepared if need be to potentially [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3378.0s)]
*  stay the night like people were raffling food down from the second floor some people brought [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3382.5600000000004s)]
*  in prayer mats they were playing praying mugwrap in the back like we were you know like we we could [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3386.5600000000004s)]
*  have stayed if we had wanted to right and so i think that seeing that level of community come [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3390.5600000000004s)]
*  together and those that level of numbers was like admin cannot repress all of us at least not in [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3396.16s)]
*  this moment and so that allowed them to back off on suspension threats and so i think that [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3402.48s)]
*  sort of model is kind of how we've been approaching things it obviously doesn't always work [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3407.8399999999997s)]
*  because you know um admin will uh is you know going to be determined in its repression um [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3411.68s)]
*  but i think that was the first time that we realized like if we have the numbers and if we [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3418.0s)]
*  have the strength we can kind of go forward and as the media was kind of going on about this sit-in [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3421.04s)]
*  we had like other student groups like the black students union the black graduate student [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3426.88s)]
*  association the asian american initiative the arab student organization and some other groups [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3430.88s)]
*  like police statements in solidarity with the protest and what we were doing we've kind of [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3435.7599999999998s)]
*  developed this like coalition for palestine um kind of similar to to what folks over at like columbia [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3440.72s)]
*  a lot of these other schools have been doing although i think we only have like 15 or so [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3446.32s)]
*  student groups um so it's very it's always honestly really cool to see um all these like really big [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3450.56s)]
*  coalitions kind of forming at all these different campuses um and so i think having that coalition [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3456.32s)]
*  has also been a way for us to um push back against repression so when we've got suspended the cia [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3461.92s)]
*  in february and when we still have the sanction letters which basically said that um not only can [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3469.84s)]
*  you not break another rule because we will probably suspend you but in the meantime until [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3475.52s)]
*  this sanction letter is resolved you cannot engage in any leadership activities in any clubs now what [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3480.16s)]
*  is a leadership activity we still don't know because they were basically categorizing anything [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3486.16s)]
*  as a leadership activity right typically leadership activity is something like you know being the [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3491.44s)]
*  president or treasurer of a club which in of itself that was already a very harsh sanction because [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3495.52s)]
*  we have members who are in the exec of like their cultural organizations or like their [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3500.32s)]
*  social organizations or their discussion groups like other very not even political groups that [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3505.44s)]
*  they now were unable to be a part of and it was kind of effectively taking the most politically [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3510.48s)]
*  active members of our campus and removing them from other parts of campus life um but then on [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3515.52s)]
*  top of that they what we had at the time was once the zionists found out that we had these [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3522.4s)]
*  um sanctions against us that we couldn't do these leadership activities um say i'm you know [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3528.08s)]
*  tabling so we have like these like tabling booths that student groups can like reserve and we would [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3533.44s)]
*  have like a coalition partner that wasn't like the cia reserve a tabling spot so maybe mit divest [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3537.44s)]
*  which is like the fossil fuel group they'll like reserve a tabling spot so that we can still [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3543.36s)]
*  continue to talk about palestine with these groups that are aligned with us we would have the zionists [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3546.56s)]
*  come around take photos of us at the table send it to the administration and be like see they're [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3551.28s)]
*  they're still they're still organizing see that they're still doing this is a leadership activity [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3556.24s)]
*  and then we get pulled into a meeting with administration and they tell us to stop tabling [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3560.3999999999996s)]
*  we have to explain that simply sitting at a table and talking about palestine is not a leadership [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3564.24s)]
*  activity nor has it ever been for any other club um it was just very clear that they hoped that [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3569.04s)]
*  suspending the cia would just mean that no palestine that nobody would be talking about [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3575.9199999999996s)]
*  palestinian work you know what i mean we would have zionists come up to the table with like again [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3580.4799999999996s)]
*  a different student group maybe the black student union is the one that has reserved the table that [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3584.88s)]
*  day and other people are tabling and they'd be like didn't you guys get suspended you know saying [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3588.32s)]
*  like if we're even talking about palestine like they just felt like our suspension should have just [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3594.4s)]
*  solved the problem on campus you know what i mean um and so i think because we have those coalition [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3599.6800000000003s)]
*  partners it's been really helpful to continue the organizing on campus so the week after we got [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3605.2000000000003s)]
*  suspended um the bsu and the bgsa two black student groups um held a rally and a disruption [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3610.16s)]
*  of this mlk gala that happens every year i think this year was like the 15th anniversary some big [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3616.7999999999997s)]
*  anniversary um a lot of administrators go and you know it's as expected i mean it's a very cool event [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3622.3199999999997s)]
*  um for the black community on campus but there's obviously a lot of hypocrisy with like the [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3627.8399999999997s)]
*  presidents going up and speaking to mlk's legacy of um this sort of thing um while also doing that [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3632.24s)]
*  like there was it was very hypocritical um and so we did this disruption of this mlk gala um and [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3639.9199999999996s)]
*  it was like spearheaded by the bsu and the black and the black graduate student association and so [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3645.6s)]
*  again in that way we were able to continue to organize to talk about the genocide in palestine [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3649.8399999999997s)]
*  to talk about caa's demands around the research ties and to also call out admin for this repression [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3654.4799999999996s)]
*  without putting like the people who are currently under sanctions at risk at the time [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3660.6400000000003s)]
*  but again being able to do it through our coalition partners and more and more we're [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3665.6800000000003s)]
*  seeing that right so we are still suspended but maybe the asian american initiative books the room [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3669.5200000000004s)]
*  this day or you know um there you know we have we have other groups that are able to to do these [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3674.32s)]
*  sorts of things and so um yeah i think i think i think that coalition is what's going to keep us [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3680.8s)]
*  strong going forward and i think it's made them realize they can't uh shut us up like they really [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3688.08s)]
*  just thought that like um even the sanctions you know i feel like they thought that if they just [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3693.12s)]
*  got rid of the visible leaders that would be enough to make everything go away um it clearly [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3697.44s)]
*  isn't um i think administration has a skewed view of how many people on campus are pro palestine [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3702.08s)]
*  so i mentioned how like 12 percent of the undergraduate body has signed on to this pledge [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3708.72s)]
*  we recently had like an undergraduate referendum basically calling on the cutting of those research [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3713.44s)]
*  ties that i mentioned before standing in solidarity with pro palestine organizers facing repression [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3718.88s)]
*  as well as just calling for joining the global call for a ceasefire and that that referendum [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3724.0s)]
*  passed like two to one it got like record turnout in a year where like um basically we have like our [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3729.84s)]
*  like class body like presidents and vice president elections at the same time there was nobody running [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3736.56s)]
*  for like any other position like the class council positions were like all uncontested except for like [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3741.28s)]
*  one and the like student body president was also uncontested so like the only reason people had to [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3745.6800000000003s)]
*  vote in this election was for the two referenda that were on the ballot ours and there was also [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3750.96s)]
*  an unrelated one um and it got record turnout like like 45 percent of the student body and [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3755.6000000000004s)]
*  undergraduate body at mit voted which is very good normally it's like 20 something percent um [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3761.36s)]
*  and with that 1200 people voted yes on our referendum which apparently admin thought that [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3767.04s)]
*  there was like five percent of the undergraduates max that might um be in solidarity with the cia [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3772.9599999999996s)]
*  and so i think these sorts of shows um just continue to show the administration that like [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3779.8399999999997s)]
*  you can try to target like a specific organization or specific leaders but that's not going to [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3784.7999999999997s)]
*  actually do anything um for the campus and uh like we had our undergraduate one but now the [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3789.52s)]
*  graduate students are basically doing a similar thing but through their union which also adds [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3795.84s)]
*  another layer of protection um as like a graduate student union um and so there's i'm pretty [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3799.6800000000003s)]
*  confident that um they will be able to get theirs passed as well it's been a rough battle they've [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3806.0s)]
*  also had their their share of zionist attacks and we had a lot of zionist interference with [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3810.4s)]
*  the undergraduate referendum uh there were these trucks um roaming around the uh the street during [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3815.6000000000004s)]
*  our referendum telling people to vote no which is just just like monetarily it's such an insane [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3822.48s)]
*  amount of money to spend to like enter like an undergraduate student body election and then to [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3827.28s)]
*  still get completely body slammed with the vote turnout um but yeah a lot of a lot of things i [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3832.16s)]
*  could say but i think just being creative in the ways that we organize um and just showing that [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3838.16s)]
*  like an organization is not just its leaders or even it's like leading organization like like a [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3844.96s)]
*  movement is much bigger than that and i think we've shown that despite the suspension of the [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3850.0s)]
*  caa and the sanctions against individual leaders like the fact that the movement is still going [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3854.8s)]
*  has shown that this is actually a very broad movement it's not something that's [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3861.04s)]
*  all like solely determined by the leading figures in it i think that shows that we're pretty strong [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3865.04s)]
*  right thank you so much so sophia and and caa is the coalition against apartheid at mit um [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3870.88s)]
*  and and finally sabir you know i know you're uh you're studying abroad but you're still very [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3878.96s)]
*  much a part of the student body organizing sphere at the university of pennsylvania [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3886.64s)]
*  how are students uh at upenn organizing and and fighting back and has the atmosphere of repression [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3894.24s)]
*  um silenced the movement at all or how do you see it right now you know amazingly the short answer [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3904.4s)]
*  is no um it's really interesting because last year was an amazing year for direct action on our [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3913.12s)]
*  campus and um myself i was put in disciplinary processes for what's happening last year and [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3921.36s)]
*  last year we were advocating against displacement which is a theme that is present in the history [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3930.48s)]
*  of palestinian advocacy displacement um again mentioning the placement of um pen on the black [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3938.56s)]
*  bottom the historic black bottom of philadelphia and just in general like the lenni and lennope land [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3945.6s)]
*  in philadelphia um the university again like prides itself on these liberal values but is very [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3952.4s)]
*  violent towards the actual residents of philadelphia and the black community so last [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3959.7599999999998s)]
*  year there was a lot of repression um students were targeted in their homes they were um like i was [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3965.2799999999997s)]
*  suspended from a student group that was totally unaffiliated from um the actual like protest [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3972.16s)]
*  it's similar to what sofia had mentioned that like you know students who are leaders of the [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3978.88s)]
*  political advocacy are removed from student society they're not allowed to be students [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3983.76s)]
*  but because we had last year it was so much more not easier but it was more familiar about the [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3989.1200000000003s)]
*  repression because this has happened before um disruption direct action is not something new to [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=3996.88s)]
*  pen um there's been a lot of administration changes with liz mcgill you know uh leaving [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=4002.88s)]
*  not even just a year after she was put in our university uh campus but to be honest last year [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=4009.52s)]
*  was really difficult for her because we disrupted convocation you know her entire inauguration was [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=4015.8399999999997s)]
*  disrupted um we camped on campus for over 30 days and then you know had an amazing action right at [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=4022.16s)]
*  the end um you know penn students are proud to have um you know resisted against increased [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=4031.2s)]
*  police presence on our campus against this genocide against uh penn's complicity in um [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=4040.16s)]
*  you know israeli aggression against palestinians and it's um you know funding towards apartheid [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=4047.4399999999996s)]
*  genocide and military like assistance and innovation towards the settler settler [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=4055.12s)]
*  colonialist um project um penn students are very firm in that and it's kind of exactly what everyone [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=4062.4s)]
*  has said you can't just target the leaders because there is no leader in our campus you know we're [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=4069.68s)]
*  all together we're all students faculty staff you know um it's great to have um you know someone [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=4075.04s)]

*  say from philadelphia to palestine occupation is um occupation is not justified um and that's that's [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=4165.2s)]
*  really the entire motto of the student body obviously like um in conversation with the [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=4176.24s)]
*  zionist community members because you know zionist presence on our campus is very loud um with um [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=4183.12s)]

*  really repressed when it just started and it wasn't even that radical um you know we started off with [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=4207.92s)]
*  the two-sidedism you know just talking coins and walking around that but now we have really grown [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=4213.76s)]
*  into a stronger and more firm stances about what freedom for palestine actually looks like um so [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=4222.96s)]
*  this isn't new repression isn't new and it's not scary for any of us it's more of like it affirms [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=4230.56s)]
*  our community it affirms that we don't find liberation within these elite institutions [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=4236.0s)]
*  although many of us um are grateful to be part of these institutions you know myself included [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=4241.52s)]
*  being a fgli student we recognize that it is a privilege to be in these spaces but it's not a [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=4247.200000000001s)]
*  privilege it's not justified to use that privilege to you know be complicit in what the university's [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=4252.320000000001s)]
*  you know wants itself to stand for um you know as these students we are in a unique position [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=4258.64s)]
*  especially within the city of philadelphia um that you know pen doesn't pay any taxes [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7BIjQLSg18&t=4264.64s)]
