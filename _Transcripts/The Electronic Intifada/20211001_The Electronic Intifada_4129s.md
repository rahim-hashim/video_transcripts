Video Description: Tamara and Asa speak to leading Palestinian intellectual Joseph Massad for a wide-ranging discussion on the true role of the Palestinian Authority as a collaborationist body with Israeli apartheid, repression and colonization.
Massad teaches modern Arab politics and intellectual history at Columbia University in New York. He is the author of several books, including Desiring Arabs and Islam and Liberalism.
He writes a regular column for Middle East Eye and has also written for The Electronic Intifada.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve been describing the Palestinian Authority as a collaborating authority ever since its inception back in 1994,‚Äù Massad tells us. He explains that the PA was always intended to protect Israel and stop Palestinians from resisting occupation.
He explains the long history of Israeli and Zionist efforts and how they so often failed due to the chosen collaborators‚Äô lack of popular support and national legitimacy among Palestinians.
But the PA has proven the ideal collaborator for Israel, since it has been able to draw on the legitimacy provided by the Palestine Liberation Organization‚Äôs history of revolutionary struggle.
The PA allowed Israel to ‚Äútransform the PLO itself into an anti-PLO collaborationist leadership,‚Äù Massad explains.

**The Electronic Intifada:** [October 01, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4)
*  Question 2 [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=0.0s)]
*  Question 3 [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=13.620000000000001s)]
*  Welcome back to the Electronic Intifada Podcast. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=21.62s)]
*  My name is Tamara Nassar. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=43.66s)]
*  I am subbing for my colleague, Nora Beros Friedman, and this is Asa Winstanley. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=45.14s)]
*  We are delighted to welcome our very special guest today, Rzaif Mas'ad. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=50.38s)]
*  Professor Mas'ad teaches modern Arab politics and intellectual history at Columbia University [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=56.38s)]
*  in New York City. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=61.620000000000005s)]
*  He is the author of several books, including Desiring Arabs and Islam and Liberalism. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=63.22s)]
*  He is also one of the leading Palestinian intellectuals of our time. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=69.66s)]
*  Professor Mas'ad, thank you for joining us back on the show. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=75.58s)]
*  It's a pleasure to be back. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=78.86s)]
*  Thank you Tamara for having me. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=79.86s)]
*  Thanks for joining us. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=82.06s)]
*  We know you're very busy and it's a real privilege for us to have you back on the show again. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=83.06s)]
*  Always a pleasure. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=89.66s)]
*  Always a pleasure, Asa. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=90.66s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=91.66s)]
*  So the Palestinian Authority has been in the news since the horrific murder of a prominent [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=92.66s)]
*  Palestinian dissident in the custody of security forces on June 24th earlier this year. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=98.06s)]
*  The killing of Banat and the PA's subsequent attacks, arrests, beatings of demonstrators [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=106.10000000000001s)]
*  protesting his killing have exposed more than ever the purpose of the PA's existence fundamentally [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=113.7s)]
*  as Israel's collaborator. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=121.18s)]
*  So today's discussion will give a brief overview of what these past few months have revealed [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=124.58000000000001s)]
*  about the Palestinian Authority and its origins, but it will also give an overview of the position [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=129.8s)]
*  that the PA occupies today. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=139.24s)]
*  So in a recent Middle East eyepiece in June, you described the Palestinian Authority as [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=142.8s)]
*  a collaborating body with the Israeli apartheid regime under US sponsorship. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=148.96s)]
*  Could you please start by explaining how the PA acts for Israel and not for the Palestinian [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=154.8s)]
*  citizens? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=159.76s)]
*  Well, I've been describing the Palestinian Authority as a collaborating authority ever [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=160.76s)]
*  since its inception back in 1994 when it took over power after the PLO signed the Oslo Agreement [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=166.39999999999998s)]
*  in September 1993, around 28 years this week, 28 years ago. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=175.67999999999998s)]
*  I think that the PA was created precisely as a collaborating body through the Oslo mechanism. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=184.51999999999998s)]
*  I remember the Israelis had been always looking, always on the lookout, searching for collaborating [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=192.92s)]
*  Palestinians and they found a good number since the 1920s. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=199.16s)]
*  However, they were unable and were unsuccessful in finding Palestinians with much national [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=203.76s)]
*  legitimacy to collaborate with them. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=210.36s)]
*  Ever since the PLO was created in 1964 and subsequently since 1969 when the guerrilla [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=214.76000000000002s)]
*  groups took over the PLO and it began to represent the effort of Palestinians to resist and combat [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=222.92000000000002s)]
*  Israeli colonialism, the Israelis began to look very seriously for an alternative to [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=234.16000000000003s)]
*  the PLO. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=240.48s)]
*  This became more pressing in the early 1970s, early to mid 1970s, as the PLO began to get [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=241.48s)]
*  international recognition. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=247.56s)]
*  In 1973, it received recognition from that non-aligned movement. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=249.35999999999999s)]
*  In 1974, it received it from both the League of Arab States as well as the United Nations. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=254.11999999999998s)]
*  Therefore, the Israelis were most concerned about the ascending international legitimacy [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=261.47999999999996s)]
*  of the Palestinian cause as represented by the guerrilla dominated PLO. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=268.16s)]
*  They went through a number of strategies, one of which was having mayoral elections [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=274.32s)]
*  in the West Bank and Gaza. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=282.52000000000004s)]
*  Initially successful in 1972, they brought about mayors that were loyalists to the Hashemite [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=285.08000000000004s)]
*  regime in Jordan, which had been on very good terms with the Israelis and with the Zionists [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=293.32s)]
*  since the 1920s and therefore tried to or hoped that they could in fact stand in for [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=298.44s)]
*  Palestinian interests rather than the PLO, especially as their political position would [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=309.0s)]
*  not have been inimical to that of Israel, but rather cooperative. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=314.84000000000003s)]
*  It didn't work. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=319.96s)]
*  By 1976, the entire slate of mayors that were elected were elected on a PLO platform. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=320.96s)]
*  The elections backfired on Israel, who had at the time hoped to project a kind of image [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=328.64s)]
*  of a benign military occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=335.88s)]
*  They tried again with the failure of the mayoral and municipal elections. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=341.84s)]
*  They tried with something they called the Village Leagues in 1978, which also fell through [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=346.96s)]
*  in the early 80s as most of the participants in the Village League project were immediately [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=352.44s)]
*  identified as collaborators and traitors by the PLO and were threatened if they were to [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=358.08s)]
*  participate in that body. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=365.12s)]
*  All these attempts had failed and we can speak perhaps later on the history of earlier attempts [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=369.4s)]
*  to co-opt Palestinian leaders. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=375.68s)]
*  The Israelis decided in the 1980s they went back to the Jordan option, which had been [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=379.92s)]
*  given up by King Hussein in the middle of the 1970s, not out of his own will, but as [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=385.56s)]
*  a result of the will of the League of Arab States, which chose at the time to recognize [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=391.84000000000003s)]
*  the PLO as the small legitimate representative of the Palestinians. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=396.08s)]
*  Nonetheless, after the Israeli invasion of Lebanon and the defeat of the PLO and its [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=400.36s)]
*  exile, and certainly after it was fragmented in 1983 through a kind of a civil war between [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=405.28000000000003s)]
*  the different factions of the PLO, the Jordanians decided in the middle of the 1980s to perhaps [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=413.52000000000004s)]
*  extend a rope to save it from drowning by allowing it to hold a PNC meeting in Aamman [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=420.56s)]
*  when other countries in the Arab world had refused. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=428.6s)]
*  This was in preparation for some kind of final, what was called at the time pragmatic position [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=432.28s)]
*  that the PLO would adopt. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=440.32s)]
*  Things accelerated quickly. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=443.79999999999995s)]
*  Finally, the Jordan option was no longer available in 1987 with the Palestinian uprising engulfing [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=446.76s)]
*  the occupied territories. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=454.2s)]
*  The Jordanian regime decided to delink itself from the West Bank. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=455.72s)]
*  And the Israelis now were in a bind that the Jordanian regime, which had historically spoken [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=463.72s)]
*  for the Palestinians, were now delinking. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=470.36s)]
*  The saving grace of this entire story was, of course, the Gulf War and the penalties that [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=475.28000000000003s)]
*  accumulated against the PLO as a result in terms of funding by Gulf governments, which stopped. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=481.56s)]
*  Iraq stopped funding because it was now under siege. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=489.03999999999996s)]
*  This was coupled with a major failure internationally in terms of its diplomatic stature with the [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=492.44s)]
*  collapse of the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=498.76s)]
*  So the PLO was finally exactly where Israel had always hoped it would be without funds, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=501.35999999999996s)]
*  without diplomatic backing. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=507.35999999999996s)]
*  It could now bend in any possible way that the Israelis would want to. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=509.92s)]
*  And indeed, it did. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=515.24s)]
*  So this is the time when even though in 91, they were not really sure and they still brought [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=516.68s)]
*  in the Jordanians to speak for the Palestinians at the Madrid conference. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=521.8s)]
*  I mean, they brought in a Palestinian delegation under the rubric of the Jordanian delegation. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=527.48s)]
*  But secretly, they were basically hammering out a deal to make sure the PLO surrendered [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=532.68s)]
*  completely on all the principles for which it had stood since the middle of the 1960s [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=539.6s)]
*  and certainly since 1969, which it obliged at Oslo. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=546.92s)]
*  So the PLO, in that sense, was transformed through the mechanism of Oslo from the liberation [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=551.0s)]
*  to a movement or an organization that would help enforce the occupation with which the [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=557.6800000000001s)]
*  Israelis in a way subcontracted Jewish settler colonialism in the occupied territories. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=568.4s)]
*  This was very important, of course, for the Israelis, a great achievement because the PLO [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=578.36s)]
*  had a huge amount of legitimacy prior to 1993 as a representative of the Palestinians. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=582.8000000000001s)]
*  And therefore, rather than find a counter organization to the PLO, which they had tried [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=588.88s)]
*  to do, which always lacked that kind of legitimacy, they hoped, and perhaps correctly to a certain [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=595.12s)]
*  extent, that the legitimacy of the period of struggle that the PLO had acquired would [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=601.8000000000001s)]
*  sort of have a large momentum that would carry it through its collaborationist future in a way. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=609.52s)]
*  And to a certain extent, that's exactly sort of how things unfolded. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=616.48s)]
*  But very, very quickly, of course, the PLO gave way to the Palestinian authority, which [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=620.08s)]
*  Oslo insisted on it as a body to be created and to be the future negotiator with Israel [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=626.48s)]
*  on whatever deal they would broker. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=633.68s)]
*  The PLO, as a representative of all Palestinians, was relegated to the background. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=636.32s)]
*  The PA came to speak for the Palestinians on the occupied territories minus East Jerusalem. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=641.2s)]
*  Of course, not the diaspora, not the refugees, and certainly not Palestinians inside Israel. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=648.5600000000001s)]
*  So in one stroke, not only did the PLO become a collaborating body, it ceased to, in doing so, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=654.0s)]
*  it contracted the Palestinian people by two-thirds, meaning it gave up its representative [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=662.56s)]
*  capacity for all Palestinians and claimed now, as Israel had been doing for decades, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=668.8s)]
*  that the Palestinian people are only those who live in the West Bank and Gaza, and therefore [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=674.8s)]
*  they're the only ones that Israel would be concerned with in terms of any possible deal [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=680.4799999999999s)]
*  in the future. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=686.64s)]
*  And the budget and the money that used to go into the coffers of the PLO were now dry [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=688.08s)]
*  and they were transferred to the PA. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=695.28s)]
*  So as a result, definitionally, the Palestinian authority was created as a collaborationist [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=697.36s)]
*  body to help enforce the occupation. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=706.5600000000001s)]
*  It was created through the Cairo agreement, or rather its police force was created through [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=710.64s)]
*  the Cairo agreement, and the responsibilities for its police force was precisely to safeguard [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=716.08s)]
*  Jewish colonial settlers in the occupied territories in Gaza and the West Bank, and to [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=722.08s)]
*  prevent all acts of Palestinian resistance against the Israeli occupation, and most [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=728.64s)]
*  importantly, to demobilize Palestinian society, which had been highly mobilized since December [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=734.64s)]
*  1987, after the eruption of the Palestinian revolt, known as the First Intifada. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=740.24s)]
*  So it quickly moved to perform all these tasks with aplomb, I would say. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=748.0s)]
*  So you've talked a little bit there about earlier in what you were saying about the [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=757.8399999999999s)]
*  village leagues, the failure of the village leagues as a kind of precursor, in a way, to [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=762.8s)]
*  the Palestinian authority as a collaborationist entity in the West Bank. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=768.72s)]
*  Could you talk about earlier efforts by Israel and the Zionist movement before 1948 to recruit [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=774.24s)]
*  Palestinian collaborators? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=782.1600000000001s)]
*  Indeed. I think the effort was really an important one, and it begins as soon as the [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=785.2s)]
*  British occupation of Palestine begins in December, late November, early December 1917, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=790.8000000000001s)]
*  by August 1918, much of Palestinian was under British occupation. The Zionist executive, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=797.84s)]
*  which was set up to represent the colonial settler Jewish population in Palestine, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=804.32s)]
*  began to pay closer attention to the question of co-opting Palestinian leaders or Palestinians [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=811.6800000000001s)]
*  whom the Zionists would make into leaders to speak for the Palestinians. One of the important [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=821.04s)]
*  responses that Palestinians had after the British occupation, and they continued their ongoing [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=827.76s)]
*  resistance to Jewish settler colonialism that had begun in the 1880s, was the creation of [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=833.4399999999999s)]
*  Muslim Christian associations. They had to do this because the British set up a sectarian system as [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=838.88s)]
*  soon as they came in. They insisted on Palestine being divided among its different religious [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=844.88s)]
*  sects, meaning Muslims, Christians, and Jews. There was a very tiny community of Jews who had [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=851.92s)]
*  been in Palestine since the 16th century. They numbered about 4,000 in the middle of the 19th [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=861.12s)]
*  century. There were probably about 10,000 at that time, but there was, of course, a growing body of [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=868.4s)]
*  Jewish colonial settlers who now seem to have amalgamated, according to the British in Palestinian [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=874.32s)]
*  society, that they constituted a separate, almost indigenous sect rather than a colonial settler [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=880.4000000000001s)]
*  sect. In that sense, what the British were doing in Palestine in the early 20s is not unlike what [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=887.36s)]
*  the Americans tried to do in Iraq after the occupation of segmenting it along ethnic or [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=892.48s)]
*  religious lines. However, in doing so, Sunni Shia, and it's more complicated in Iraq because they [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=897.9200000000001s)]
*  did it religiously in terms of Sunni and Shia, and then they did the Kurdish versus Arab, although [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=903.84s)]
*  it was just like those Kurdish parties and the Arabs were divided into Sunni and Shiites. This [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=909.84s)]
*  way, the Iraqi people now became three different segments in the name of American-style democracy, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=914.72s)]
*  if you will. So the British had done something very similar. To counter that, early on, Palestinian [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=922.64s)]
*  Muslims and Christians immediately set up Muslim-Christian associations, first of all, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=928.72s)]
*  to gain legitimacy in the new sectarian system that the British had established, and at the same [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=933.84s)]
*  time, to show unity of purpose and of political goals in fighting the Balfour Declaration, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=939.6800000000001s)]
*  British occupation, as well as the facilitation of Jewish settler colonialism, which the British [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=946.0s)]
*  occupation and mandate promised to sponsor and were indeed already sponsoring. So as [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=951.28s)]
*  a result, the Zionist executive was very concerned about the solidarity among Palestinian Christians [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=958.4s)]
*  and Muslims and began to work to undermine this show of communal solidarity among Palestinian [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=966.3199999999999s)]
*  Christians and Muslims. So they began to sponsor and finance Muslim national associations and [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=973.84s)]
*  excluded Christians with local collaborators. This would become a very important effort. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=980.0799999999999s)]
*  They would choose several Palestinians to collaborate with them on the Muslim national [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=986.8000000000001s)]
*  associations. One of them, of course, was a collaborator, a Palestinian mayor of Haifa [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=994.88s)]
*  by the name of Hassan Shoukri, who was already in office since 1914 by the Ottomans and who in 1921 [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1002.08s)]
*  thanked the British in a letter for issuing the Balfour Declaration and continued to collaborate [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1009.44s)]
*  with them until his death in 1940. There were several assassination attempts on him in the [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1014.64s)]
*  1930s that were unsuccessful. He died of natural causes in 1940 and remains a hero, a hero collaborator [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1020.88s)]
*  for Zionism and Israel who celebrate, continue to celebrate them to this day. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1028.4s)]
*  So there were others, of course, who were involved in this project, Hayim Kalwarisky, one of the most [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1035.68s)]
*  important Zionist colonial officials who was also in charge of the so-called Arab department [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1041.76s)]
*  in the Zionist executive that represented the colonial settler community. Palestine was the [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1046.88s)]
*  one in charge of co-opting Palestinians to put them on the payroll of the Zionist executive [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1053.3600000000001s)]
*  and to advance the agenda of Zionism. But Zionism was not a threat to the Palestinians [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1061.68s)]
*  at all, that they would improve Palestinian lives and that they should be [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1068.0s)]
*  viewed as friends and not as colonial conquerors, for example. Indeed, someone like Hassan Shoukri [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1073.6s)]
*  would later insist on adding Hebrew to official bureaucratic paperwork in the Haifa municipality [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1081.6s)]
*  in the 1930s, despite the fact that Arabic was always the official language and all the [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1089.68s)]
*  native population of Haifa spoke Arabic as their native language, regardless of if they were [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1096.88s)]
*  Jewish, even the small Jewish community who spoke Arabic versus the colonial settlers, of course, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1104.3200000000002s)]
*  who did not. So that's one aspect of this. They even set up with the help of a major Jerusalemite [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1108.96s)]
*  family, the Neshachibi family or its leaders, who were in opposition to another Palestinian [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1116.8000000000002s)]
*  Jerusalem family that the British also appointed to high office. They played both families against [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1123.6s)]
*  one another, but the Neshachibis would not only collaborate with the British, but especially with [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1130.6399999999999s)]
*  the Zionists, even in creating what was called then peasant parties or sometimes farmer parties [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1135.04s)]
*  that allegedly were organized by the Zionists against Palestinian landlords, although of course [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1141.52s)]
*  it was Palestinian big landlords who set them up as a front for Zionist interests. There were [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1146.1599999999999s)]
*  small, they did not have much following. It's not unlike what you have in all other colonial [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1153.2s)]
*  situations where the colonizing power sets up bodies of collaborators and tries to infiltrate [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1157.76s)]
*  all resistance against the colonial project. So the Muslim national associations were of course [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1164.48s)]
*  meant to alienate Palestinian Christians, that Muslims were having their own associations, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1173.28s)]
*  and slowly the British would only recognize a lot of these religious organizations separately. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1179.8400000000001s)]
*  They would set up something called the Islamic, the Supreme Islamic Council for [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1185.5200000000002s)]
*  Palestinian Muslims, Palestinian Christians divided into a number of denominations, the largest of [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1192.64s)]
*  which of course is the Eastern Orthodox Palestinian Christians, set up their own organizations that [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1198.72s)]
*  were in alliance with the Muslim organizations, but now were separate because the British demanded [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1204.48s)]
*  that even municipal elections be divided along sectarian lines. So the kind of sectarianism that [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1210.3200000000002s)]
*  the British and the Zionists introduced into Palestine was the main venue through which they [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1217.92s)]
*  had hoped collaboration with the colonizers would be most effective. To a certain extent, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1223.44s)]
*  they did create some sectarian divisions in the late 1920s and early 1930s, especially as the [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1230.48s)]
*  British would allow a major evangelical Protestant world or a conference to take place in Jerusalem [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1238.48s)]
*  at that time, sponsored mostly by the British founded YMCA, but sponsored by its American [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1248.16s)]
*  branches at the time, in the hope of sort of making Jerusalem a center for evangelical [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1256.56s)]
*  Christianity. Most Palestinian Christians, especially the Orthodox, whose laity had been [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1263.84s)]
*  targeted by Protestant evangelicals to be converted to their religion, immediately opposed the [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1272.32s)]
*  conference as did other Muslims, but of course there was all kinds of sectarian propaganda put [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1278.08s)]
*  forth that the evangelicals might have been supported by Palestinian Christians, which of [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1282.88s)]
*  course they were not, and indeed all the major bodies of Palestinian, representative bodies of [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1288.96s)]
*  Palestinian Muslims and Christians came together to condemn the conference and condemn the sectarian [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1294.64s)]
*  sort of campaign that ensued. After the Palestinian revolt began, initially in 1935 [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1301.68s)]
*  with the guerrilla groups under Azaddin al-Qassam and subsequently when the strike began in 1936 [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1314.48s)]
*  with the revolt becoming increasingly widespread across the country and British repression [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1321.92s)]
*  becoming more and more draconian, the British and the Zionists were able to fund and train [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1328.24s)]
*  a number of Palestinian collaborators, some of whom had been actually part of the Palestinian [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1336.96s)]
*  revolt, but were co-opted by the British representative in Damascus at the time, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1342.32s)]
*  sent back to Palestine to lead what was then called the peace bands or what Palestinian [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1347.44s)]
*  nationalists would refer to as the peace gangs, who began to target the Palestinian revolutionaries [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1352.88s)]
*  and shoot them and they were of course on the payroll of the Zionists and the British had helped [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1358.4s)]
*  train them. Ultimately two of the major leaders of the peace bands, Fakhri Nasha Shiwi and Fakhri [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1364.96s)]
*  Abdul Hadi would be assassinated in 1941 and 1943 by Palestinian loyalists for their collaboration. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1371.6000000000001s)]
*  They did not of course command a large following but they clearly were able to inflict some [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1381.84s)]
*  harm on the Palestinian revolution. After 1948, Palestinians living inside Israel were subjected, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1389.36s)]
*  those who were not expelled, the remaining Palestinians who were managed to not to be [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1397.9199999999998s)]
*  expelled inside Israel, also their leaders were being co-opted, especially village Mukhtars or [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1404.0s)]
*  the village elders, the mayors, through whom the Israelis tried to impose their apartheid policies [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1411.44s)]
*  and the past laws that they imposed on Palestinian citizens of Israel from 1948 to 1966, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1421.2s)]
*  which was extended actually to 1967 before it was finally removed. All of that happened through the [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1428.64s)]
*  Mukhtars and some other sort of collaborating Palestinians, which takes us to the occupied [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1433.52s)]
*  territories after 1967, where as I mentioned earlier the municipal elections would be the [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1442.0s)]
*  sort of major venue of the early 70s moving to the village league at the late 70s. So [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1449.52s)]
*  the Israelis had or the Zionists had never tired of finding Palestinians who would collaborate [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1455.04s)]
*  with them. The problem with all these attempts, as I was saying earlier, is that few of these [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1461.04s)]
*  collaborators had ever had any legitimacy in the eyes of the majority of the Palestinian people [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1467.36s)]
*  and no national representative body ever collaborated in this sense or the Israelis were unable to [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1473.12s)]
*  co-opt them until they co-opted the PLO and transformed it into the PA in the early 1990s. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1480.0s)]
*  So those first years when the Palestinian Authority was founded out of a transition [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1491.28s)]
*  from the Palestine Liberation Organization, what did they look like on the ground? And [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1497.52s)]
*  can you think of other comparable examples in history of a liberation movement going over [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1503.36s)]
*  to the side of oppressor? Well, I mean at the beginning of the PA rule or Oslo, like I said [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1510.56s)]
*  earlier, the Cairo Agreement and subsequently the Washington signing of it or ratification of it [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1520.4s)]
*  created the bodies of Palestinian security, sort of a core that would be used to repress the [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1526.16s)]
*  Palestinians and to prevent any resistance to them. I've written several times on the earliest [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1535.0400000000002s)]
*  of incidents when three Fatah militias shot this guy who refused to remove his car after he parked [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1542.8s)]
*  it in a place where they did not like in Gaza, they shot him in the legs. A few weeks later, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1551.52s)]
*  when Arafat arrived in Gaza and there was demonstrations by students against Oslo, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1558.1599999999999s)]
*  his police force killed between 13 or 14 Palestinian students, something for which he was [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1563.9199999999998s)]
*  commended by then Vice President Al Gore, who was happy with Arafat setting up military tribunals [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1571.52s)]
*  for those who opposed Oslo, which of course were depicted as terrorists or extremists who were [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1579.76s)]
*  anti-peace rather than anti-collaboration and anti-surrender. So that security body that was [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1584.8s)]
*  subsequently trained by the Americans and funded by the Americans of the EU over the years, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1594.6399999999999s)]
*  initially began as its mandate was its responsibility for internal security [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1599.76s)]
*  and for public order, meaning to prevent Palestinian resistance and to also protect Jewish [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1606.56s)]
*  colonial settlers, not in their settlements because they could not go there, but if they decide to go [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1612.56s)]
*  through Palestinian towns, whether shopping or to harass the indigenous Palestinians. So initially [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1617.44s)]
*  there was about 9,000 policemen, 7,000 of whom were brought in with the PLO from abroad from exile. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1624.24s)]
*  So these were clearly Palestinian guerrillas who were transformed through the mechanism of Oslo [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1633.28s)]
*  into mercenaries. This would be the birth certificate of the Palestinian security force. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1639.28s)]
*  But with regards to the question of precedents in other places, I mean, I think there's probably [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1647.6s)]
*  one prominent precedent, which is UNITA, which was one of the liberation movements in Angola. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1656.32s)]
*  It was one of two major liberation movements. There was the MPLA and UNITA. UNITA had been [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1663.12s)]
*  funded and supported by the Chinese from the middle of the 1960s or late 60s up to 1975 [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1668.24s)]
*  or 76. Upon the liberation of Angola, UNITA switched sides rather than from fighting the [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1676.08s)]
*  Portuguese for the liberation of Angola. As the MPLA took over the country after independence, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1681.84s)]
*  UNITA began to receive funding and training by apartheid South Africa and the US to undermine [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1689.1999999999998s)]
*  the revolution and the new independent country of Angola. And in that sense began to, when that only [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1696.32s)]
*  began, launched an actual war and raids on Angola with South Africa's apartheid backing at the time. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1701.76s)]
*  So, and of course, Angola was a settler colony as well. Most of the Portuguese settler colonists [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1713.68s)]
*  left after the end of Portuguese settler colonialism, but there had always been interest [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1721.04s)]
*  in Angola by South Africa, who had already been in occupation of Namibia, which was another white [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1728.64s)]
*  colonial settlement, bordering Angola. So in that sense, perhaps not as egregious as what the PLO did, [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1736.0800000000002s)]
*  but remember, most national, or not most, a large number of liberation groups who after, you know, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1744.48s)]
*  after they won independence in normal colonies, not in settler colonies, would come to serve as [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1750.8000000000002s)]
*  allies of the former colonial power after they come to power. The neo-destour of Tunisia, for example, [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1757.68s)]
*  which would become, of course, an ally of France. There are many, many examples. Tunisia also had been [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1765.04s)]
*  a French settler colony, not as large as France, not as large as the Italian settler colony of Libya, [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1770.5600000000002s)]
*  but nonetheless a settler colony. But you still saw this kind of collaboration by kind of a [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1777.52s)]
*  nationalist movement that was not committed necessarily to an evolutionary program, but rather [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1784.16s)]
*  to more of a garden variety titular national independence from formal colonialism, rather than [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1789.3600000000001s)]
*  any kind of economic independence which it did not call for. I want to bring it up to the [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1796.88s)]
*  present day a little bit, and how the Palestinian authority is perceived in the West, and by that, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1803.28s)]
*  I don't mean so much the Western governments, but I actually mean even the Palestine Solidarity [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1811.92s)]
*  Movement in Europe and North America. So why do some people in the Palestine Solidarity Movement [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1816.96s)]
*  view the PA as, quote unquote, the government of Palestine? I can give one example of this recently [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1826.16s)]
*  that happened in Britain, which was there was a solidarity event called the Big Ride for Palestine, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1833.28s)]
*  which was a kind of sponsored bike ride to raise funds. It was organized by the Palestine Solidarity [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1839.12s)]
*  Campaign, but at its final rally it hosted the PA's London ambassador Hassan Zomla as its [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1845.1999999999998s)]
*  star speaker. So you know, and it's just one of many examples, Hassan Zomla often attends [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1852.2399999999998s)]
*  Palestine Solidarity demonstrations in London and so forth, and his predecessor was the same, [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1858.32s)]
*  and he was welcomed by the PA, but by the PSC. So I mean, and you, one comparison people often make [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1865.92s)]
*  of the PA in terms of the South Africa example would be the Bantustans, the sort of collaborationist [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1878.3999999999999s)]
*  entities under the South African apartheid regime. So there's some similarities there with the PA, [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1885.76s)]
*  but you can't imagine the anti-apartheid movement in the 70s or 80s welcoming Bantustan leaders to [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1890.56s)]
*  London. So like, why do you think the true nature of the PA is not more widely understood [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1898.96s)]
*  in these areas, and why is it not viewed in a similar way to the Bantustan leaders? [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1905.84s)]
*  Well, I mean, several things. Remember that the PLO, again, this was the reason why the [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1910.1599999999999s)]
*  Israelis thought the best thing to do instead of finding an anti-PLO Palestinian collaborating [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1913.9199999999998s)]
*  leadership, why not transform the PLO itself into an anti-PLO collaborations leadership, [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1919.84s)]
*  because this way we could bank on its historic legitimacy. And indeed, remember the PLO in the [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1925.36s)]
*  60s and 70s and 80s was seen as not unlike all these other liberation movements from settler [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1930.32s)]
*  colonialism, whether it's the ANC, whether it was Swapo in Namibia, Frelimo in Mozambique, the MPLA [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1938.0s)]
*  in Angola, etc. So it was seen as, or Zanu, Anzapu in Rhodesia. So there's a great sort of [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1944.56s)]
*  reputation that these revolutionary groups had because of the struggle that they had engaged in [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1955.6799999999998s)]
*  to liberate their peoples from settler colonialism. This was part of the big reputation that the PLO [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1962.08s)]
*  had. Subsequently, after Oslo, the liberal propaganda insisted that what the PLO had done [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1968.64s)]
*  was basically a peace deal with Israel, where allegedly we were told there was a mutual [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1976.16s)]
*  recognition. Of course, there was no such thing at Oslo. At Oslo, the PLO recognized Israel's [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1982.0800000000002s)]
*  right to exist as a Jewish settler colony on the land of the Palestinians. In return, the Israelis [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1988.0s)]
*  only recognized the PLO as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. They [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1994.24s)]
*  did not recognize the Palestinian people's right to their homeland or a state or anything of the [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=1999.8400000000001s)]
*  sort. So it was not really mutual recognition. But US and European propaganda, as well as [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2007.1200000000001s)]
*  Arab official regime propaganda, began to put forth this idea that the PLO had not really changed. It [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2012.96s)]
*  was the same PLO and not a different one. People would begin to wake up to this perhaps after 2006 [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2020.88s)]
*  with Hamas elections that defeated Fatah. But by then, Islamophobia had been institutionalized [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2029.8400000000001s)]
*  much more so than ever before after 9-11. And therefore, the PLO or the PA maintained that it [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2037.5200000000002s)]
*  was still the legitimate Palestinian representative. The difference between the Bantustans [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2044.72s)]
*  and the ANC versus the PLO is that when the Bantustans existed, when the Nkafa movement or [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2050.88s)]
*  people like Butelezi were collaborating with apartheid South Africa, they were countered by [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2059.84s)]
*  the ANC, by Oliver Tambo, by Nelson Mandela's reputation even when he was imprisoned, [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2065.44s)]
*  which is exactly what happened when the village leagues were put about. The PLO was there to [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2073.2000000000003s)]
*  counter the village leagues. The PLO was there to counter the pro-Hashemite mayors of the early [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2076.96s)]
*  70s who had been elected in 1972. And therefore, this undermined them. But by the time the PLO [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2085.28s)]
*  itself became the Nkafa movement, if you will, or maybe to be more precise, when Arafat was [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2094.08s)]
*  transformed from Nelson Mandela into Butelezi, there was no counter to him. So as a result, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2105.04s)]
*  it gave legitimacy to the Bantustan project. Imagine if Nelson Mandela was the one who would [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2113.92s)]
*  agree to have presided over something like the Bantustans. So there was a lot of that, I think, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2118.72s)]
*  that went into people's perceptions of what the PA was. There was a lot less room for [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2127.2s)]
*  the Palestinian opposition to Oslo to be broadcast in the international Western-dominated media. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2134.4s)]
*  Perhaps there was a lot more of that in the Arab media, but less so in the international media. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2143.36s)]
*  I remember my first article against Oslo was in an academic journal, not in a journalistic [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2148.2400000000002s)]
*  mode, which I submitted, say, in October of 1993. It came out in early 94, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2155.2000000000003s)]
*  because it was a journal. It took more time to be published. But it would have been very, [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2161.84s)]
*  very difficult for me to have found newspaper outlets where I could express these views in the [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2166.48s)]
*  radical rejection of the premise of Oslo, which my article at the time had expressed. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2175.6s)]
*  Similarly, when Edward Said opposed Oslo immediately after the deal, the only place [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2181.84s)]
*  that would publish his rejection was a kind of a liberal Zionist newspaper where he had published [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2188.08s)]
*  before, which is The Nation magazine in London and New York. But he was also publishing in the [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2197.04s)]
*  Arabic press in London and in the Egyptian Al-Haram Weekly, where he expressed also [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2203.36s)]
*  his views on these questions. And indeed, most of his articles that were critical of the Palestinians, [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2209.68s)]
*  if you want the long version, you should read them in Al-Haram Weekly or in Al-Hayat in Arabic, [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2215.7599999999998s)]
*  and the much more highly, perhaps censored and shortened version would come out in The Nation [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2222.3999999999996s)]
*  magazine at that time. And I'm not really sure how many of his articles they might have rejected [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2229.6s)]
*  and how many they accepted. But that was the only venue, as I recall, where he published his [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2234.72s)]
*  early criticisms. The Palestinian Versailles called it, right? The Palestinian Versailles, yes. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2240.56s)]
*  I actually was critical of that analogy in writing when I wrote, and I discussed this with Said at [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2246.64s)]
*  the time, because I thought that Versailles was imposed on a Germany that began the war. The [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2255.04s)]
*  Palestinians never began the war. So yes, the effect of the humiliation of Germany after the [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2262.16s)]
*  war with Versailles might have been similar to the humiliation of the Palestinians. But of course, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2268.88s)]
*  a more apt analogy, I always thought, was the kinds of deals that were imposed on the ruler of [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2274.4s)]
*  Tunisia by France in the 1880s to welcome French occupation into his country as a more appropriate [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2280.48s)]
*  example, or the pressure on Egypt and the cooptation of the rulers of Egypt in the [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2290.8s)]
*  early 1880s, and which facilitated the British invasion and occupation of Egypt, ultimately, [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2297.52s)]
*  while maintaining its rulers and titular power. So I thought there were colonial precedents that [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2306.0s)]
*  could have been accessed that were perhaps more akin to what happened to the Palestinians and [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2312.08s)]
*  Versailles. Although, of course, Said's sentiment was correct in the sense that Versailles was an [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2317.84s)]
*  attempt to fully humiliate the Palestinians. Of course, the nation liked that analogy of Versailles, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2323.04s)]
*  they would repeat it several times. And I thought, of course, they had an ulterior motive, because [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2330.0s)]
*  usually what Versailles always meant was that the humiliation of Versailles is what gave ammunition [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2334.72s)]
*  to the Nazis to rise. So the idea was that the nation editors were always concerned about the [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2341.52s)]
*  Palestinians becoming Nazi rather than about the continued colonization by Zionist [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2347.36s)]
*  central colonialism of Palestinian land. So I was always not very positive about the use of the Versailles analogy. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2354.1600000000003s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2362.96s)]
*  So shifting gears a little bit, but why do you think the Palestinian authority has been [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2366.88s)]
*  so enduring almost 30 years since its inception? The recent protests against the PA in the wake of [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2376.32s)]
*  the killing of Mizar Banat and recent polls as well show that there is a profound rejection of [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2385.6s)]
*  the PA and its leader Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank. Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2393.6s)]
*  view the PA security thugs as spies, as collaborators. But at the same time, [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2401.04s)]
*  the Palestinian authority persists in its role in collaborating with Israel and its security forces [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2407.44s)]
*  acting as Israel's foot soldiers. And both the PA and its ruling party, Fatah, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2413.68s)]
*  provide some kind of or have some kind of base amongst some Palestinians in the West Bank. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2422.88s)]
*  When you compare this to the Village Leagues, there is some kind of persistence to the PA that [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2429.36s)]
*  is that would be interesting to examine. Why do you think it has endured so long? [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2436.96s)]
*  As I just mentioned, the Village Leagues had a, you know, both countered by the presence of the PLO [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2443.52s)]
*  and it was created in the late 70s, early 80s before the entrenchment of neoliberalism and [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2449.1200000000003s)]
*  the end of the Cold War. So the international context, the economic context within which it [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2456.56s)]
*  existed did not allow for its continuation in an easy fashion. And the presence of the PLO and its [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2462.0s)]
*  strong international legitimacy at the time was a major obstacle that could not be overcome. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2469.52s)]
*  The creation of the PA in the 90s after the fall of the Soviet Union, with the US being the sole [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2475.6s)]
*  superpower controlling the world, was a much easier transformation in terms of institutionalizing [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2483.84s)]
*  the interests of the PA. Remember, one of the important things that Oslo did was institutionalize [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2489.44s)]
*  the PA financially in the lives of the Palestinians. First of all, it demobilized the Palestinian [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2497.36s)]
*  revolution of the first intifada by co-opting many of its leaders into the PA political class [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2504.08s)]
*  or bureaucracy or the security apparatus and it co-opted all the technicians and the intellectuals [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2511.76s)]
*  into the mushrooming non-governmental organizations who had descended like the plague [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2519.28s)]
*  on the Palestinian territories, offering relatively very, very high incomes to activists. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2526.1600000000003s)]
*  The NGO industrial complex. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2535.44s)]
*  Absolutely, it is the NGO industrial complex. So as a result, you've created a population [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2537.52s)]
*  under occupation who is now fully dependent financially on income that comes to it from the [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2543.2s)]
*  peace process. The NGOs were created by the peace process. They were linked to it. The PA was created [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2550.72s)]
*  by the peace process. It was linked to it. The financial remuneration and financial aid that [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2556.56s)]
*  went into the PA coffers went into it as long as there was a peace process that was unfolding [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2563.12s)]
*  and ongoing. Therefore, now you've attached the majority of the Palestinian population [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2570.24s)]
*  whose economic situation was dire at the end of six years or five years of the first intifada [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2578.48s)]
*  and the destruction of much of the Palestinian, especially agricultural economy, but much of the [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2585.8399999999997s)]
*  economy in general. So this situation to rescue the Palestinians economically through employment [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2590.32s)]
*  by the PA and by the NGOs would link, I think, the Palestinians structurally and economically [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2598.48s)]
*  to the PA and the peace process. As a result, anyone who wanted to oppose the PA or to bring [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2606.4s)]
*  it down would lose their job and their livelihood. This way, you linked the livelihoods of people [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2613.6000000000004s)]
*  to their oppression, to their national oppression, and to the possibility of the continuation of [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2618.96s)]
*  their colonization by Jewish settler colonists. One of the interesting things that Oslo had done, [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2624.7200000000003s)]
*  having come about after the 1980s, after the fall of the Soviet Union, after the institutionalization [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2633.28s)]
*  and the expansion of neoliberalism, is the creation of a number of classes. Oslo created a number of [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2639.76s)]
*  classes to help institutionalize the PA as a permanent fixture. So what you had is basically [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2646.16s)]
*  a political elite that was created or brought from exile to staff the Palestinian authority, [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2658.3999999999996s)]
*  but also some of the political elites inside the West Bank and Gaza were also added to those who [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2666.16s)]
*  arrived from Tunisia. A second group was the bureaucracy that was needed to administer the [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2674.08s)]
*  population for the PA, composed mostly of local staff, but also of the attorneys that also used [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2679.92s)]
*  to staff the different PLO departments. A third segment was, of course, the security force, [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2686.96s)]
*  which was used to depress Palestinian resistance to Israel and to Oslo as it continues today, [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2694.64s)]
*  composed of former guerrillas turned mercenaries for Israel to be financed and trained by the [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2700.72s)]
*  Americans and the Europeans, employees of the non-governmental organizations, which as I've [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2706.7999999999997s)]
*  mentioned are most of the intellectual and technocratic class. They were all set up by [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2711.8399999999997s)]
*  the Americans and the Europeans, some by the Japanese. Mostly former activists and public [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2716.48s)]
*  intellectuals who participated in the first Intifada would become part of the new NGO staffs. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2722.64s)]
*  And then, of course, you have the Palestinian business class, the local and the diaspora class [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2731.04s)]
*  who returned from exile to profit off their people and off the Oslo process. And those sort of [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2737.6s)]
*  and the rich already in the West Bank and Gaza who had been already profiting under the occupation [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2744.96s)]
*  before Oslo would become a very important segment, which in fact, remember, Palestinian [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2750.08s)]
*  millionaires pushed Tarefat to sign Oslo, even if he had any doubts, which I'm not sure he did, [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2756.72s)]
*  but they pushed him to accept the deal because of how much benefit they saw in it for Palestinian [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2764.0s)]
*  businesses. So in this sense, as the Oslo Accords were signed at the height of the hegemony of [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2769.7599999999998s)]
*  international neoliberal, the international neoliberal order, the purpose, I think, of [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2776.96s)]
*  facilitating profit making for Palestinian businessmen. There was a number of programs to [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2783.28s)]
*  empower Palestinian women to become entrepreneurs, but they remain small. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2791.36s)]
*  But also sort of the linking of the Palestinian intelligentsia to the NGOs, all of that was able [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2796.2400000000002s)]
*  to ensure a relatively lean administrative staff inside the PA and an expansive security apparatus [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2801.68s)]
*  to repress resistance. Just to give you an example, a couple of years ago amidst the [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2810.56s)]
*  preparations for the deal of the centuries Bahrain conference, which Gerald Kushner had presided over [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2817.2s)]
*  on the orders of Trump. Just as they were preparing for this conference in Bahrain, [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2825.92s)]
*  the Israeli army chief of general staff, General Aviv Kochavi, had met with a prominent Palestinian [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2833.28s)]
*  millionaire in Ramallah to discuss the current economic situation in the West Bank. So we're [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2839.84s)]
*  speaking here about direct meetings between Palestinian businessmen and the Israeli military [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2844.88s)]
*  brass, not even the political brass, to discuss the economic situations and the profit making [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2850.56s)]
*  operations that the Palestinian bourgeoisie has benefited and continues to benefit from. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2856.32s)]
*  So in this sense, by the time Trump came and insisted that perhaps the PA's political class [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2862.64s)]
*  may no longer be necessary, all we need is the businessmen and the policemen, which is of course [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2870.32s)]
*  the same structure for neoliberalism everywhere in the world. The idea of having a lean government [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2875.76s)]
*  because the businessmen will be able to run things and those who oppose them will be [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2881.5200000000004s)]
*  shot by the police, hence the militarization of the police force in the US and in Europe, [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2885.2000000000003s)]
*  and the carte blanche given to business elites to run the affairs of the economy through a very [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2890.48s)]
*  friendly but lean bureaucratic staff that opposes the idea of big government, as they call it in the US. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2897.36s)]
*  So I think all of this sort of accounts for the persistence of the PA in these times, especially [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2905.76s)]
*  because the Palestinian situation and Jewish settler colonialism has persisted beyond [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2912.48s)]
*  even the last sort of liberation struggle in Africa and Asia, which was of course the [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2920.2400000000002s)]
*  South African struggle that had made a compromise that was also detrimental to the economic rights [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2926.5600000000004s)]
*  of Black South Africans in 1994. That deal that Mandela and the ANC concluded was one wherein they [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2934.32s)]
*  would trade off the granting of political rights to people of color, mostly Black people but also [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2942.56s)]
*  Indians and coloreds in South Africa in exchange for not getting any economic rights. The idea is [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2952.0s)]
*  if they accepted political rights but continued to allow economic white supremacy to prevail in [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2960.32s)]
*  South Africa, apartheid would end. That was the deal that they took and as we know of course today, [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2966.32s)]
*  poverty and the racial divisions in terms of income and property in South Africa [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2972.32s)]
*  are larger than they had been even under apartheid. Nonetheless, that was the deal that was accepted [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2980.32s)]
*  by the ANC. The Palestinians were not allowed even that kind of deal. Precisely at the time that the [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2985.76s)]
*  Bantustans were being destroyed and removed from the terrain of South Africa in 1994, they were [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=2991.1200000000003s)]
*  being created for the Palestinians through the mechanism of Oslo and the mechanism of the PLO [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3000.0800000000004s)]
*  or Arafat turned, Botelezi in the Palestinian case. But I think the international [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3006.48s)]
*  context was very important in rendering the PA longevity sort of as it has been. Namely that [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3013.28s)]
*  the age of revolutionary struggles of the 60s and 70s and even the few in the 80s had ended. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3024.2400000000002s)]
*  The bipolar world had ended. There was no longer an eastern bloc and at the time, [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3033.28s)]
*  these were the reasons why the PLO in fact ceased to be the PLO and became a collaborating authority. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3039.6s)]
*  As a result, its ability to continue in that role was enforced by the economic help [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3044.8s)]
*  that the EU and the US mostly provide to ensure Palestinian obedience and the end of Palestinian resistance. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3052.8s)]
*  What would it take for the PA to be overthrown and do you think it should be replaced before [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3062.88s)]
*  liberation or just done away with? I mean it seems to me if there is no money, the PA would not be [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3069.92s)]
*  able to survive but we do know that money continues to go into the coffers especially of the security [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3075.92s)]
*  apparatus. Now the question is, is there a way to get the PA to survive? I mean, I think the [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3082.1600000000003s)]
*  especially of the security apparatus. Now the question is, would the PA political apparatus [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3089.36s)]
*  continue to function? Trump thought they were not necessary at this point and of course, [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3094.56s)]
*  Biden seems to believe that perhaps they might need them for a bit longer. They need the security [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3103.36s)]
*  apparatus for sure but the political apparatus may prove counterproductive in that sense except [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3111.2s)]
*  for a very small sort of stuff. They would rather just keep the bureaucracy to run the [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3118.0s)]
*  everyday affairs of people mostly, like a transportation system, say the sewage system, [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3124.16s)]
*  water and electricity services, things of that sort. But aside from this, garbage collecting, [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3134.56s)]
*  besides that, they really don't need a political staff of this size whose corruption has been [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3140.88s)]
*  legendary in the last three decades and therefore you see this kind of weakness within the PA [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3146.24s)]
*  political leadership which is contrasted with amazing strength and hubris of the Palestinian [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3155.6s)]
*  security apparatus. For now, there has been no, I would say, threat coming from the security apparatus [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3162.9599999999996s)]
*  against the political apparatus even though the security apparatus understands very well [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3172.16s)]
*  that it is the favorite of the Israelis and the Americans and the political apparatus [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3176.56s)]
*  understands very well that they are not or no longer needed necessarily. Palestinian big business [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3181.3599999999997s)]
*  remains unclear on this new project. I think the big business, the Palestinian businessmen and [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3189.6s)]
*  billionaires and millionaires feel that they do need the political apparatus for now [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3198.32s)]
*  which is why I think it seems to continue to be maintained although there have been some [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3203.76s)]
*  complaints recently about its performance and indeed it's embarrassing, a repressive apparatus [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3210.2400000000002s)]
*  where it had become sort of headlines in the international press. They would rather a lot [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3218.0800000000004s)]
*  of this repression happen in a way that is not so clearly embarrassing to them. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3224.24s)]
*  So I think funding is the major criteria. If funding ends, it would end and as you saw, [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3232.24s)]
*  it almost did. It was rescued by Biden and I think had Trump continued to be in power, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3238.24s)]
*  it would not have survived for much longer and by it here, I mean the political apparatus, not the [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3243.4399999999996s)]
*  security bodies that have been set up and trained by the Americans. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3249.3599999999997s)]
*  I mean you described the embarrassing repressive apparatus and how it was covered in [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3255.04s)]
*  Western media even following the protests in reaction to Banat's killing and there was a sense [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3265.04s)]
*  that the PA's response in its crackdown on protesters was hysterical. I mean there was [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3273.12s)]
*  a really a mask-off moment. We understand the PA and the purpose for which it serves but there was [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3282.1600000000003s)]
*  really this hysterical response on protesters. You've sort of touched on this but following the US [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3290.0s)]
*  defeat in Afghanistan, do you think that the Palestinian Authority has some kind of [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3300.88s)]
*  collapse anxiety that its puppet government and it's not just its political apparatus but [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3307.36s)]
*  the entire apparatus will collapse as well? That anxiety has been there for some time I think. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3317.6800000000003s)]
*  I mean we begin to see this clearly with the failure of the PA to continue to pretend to be [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3325.6800000000003s)]
*  elected democratically in 2006 and with the end of all elections, I would remember the last time [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3335.12s)]
*  Abbas was elected or his mandate, electoral mandate ended in 2009 so as a result, [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3342.0s)]
*  he's been a sole dictator sort of without any kind of mandate ruling, well ruling is a strong word [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3350.0s)]
*  but presiding over this collaborationist authority since 2009. Now when I say these things were [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3356.88s)]
*  embarrassing, of course I think they're embarrassing to American and to the American government and [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3364.08s)]
*  American liberals and to European governments and the EU. They're not embarrassing to the PA necessarily. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3368.88s)]
*  The PA oppressive apparatus has been at it since Hafez arrived in Gaza in 1994. They have killed [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3375.84s)]
*  Palestinians, they have put them in jail, they have tried to control elections, they have attacked and [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3381.44s)]
*  tortured dissidents, they've attacked universities and students, they've tried to fix elections, [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3387.68s)]
*  they have collaborated with the Israelis in handing over Palestinians to them, they've [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3394.96s)]
*  shot the Palestinians who resisted Israelis, put them in jail, they gloat often and boast of having [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3402.8799999999997s)]
*  uncovered all kinds of resistance operations that they refer to as terrorists targeting the Israeli [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3410.08s)]
*  military occupation of the illegal colonial settlers. So none of this has caused them to feel [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3417.12s)]
*  scandalized or in any way embarrassed by these actions. The problem in the Banat assassination [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3425.52s)]
*  was of course that it embarrassed their sponsors, not the Israelis certainly who were [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3433.68s)]
*  absolutely fine with this and we did not hear much complaining from their side. However, the Americans [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3438.64s)]
*  I think were uncomfortable and disturbed and annoyed and so were the Europeans which is quite [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3446.16s)]
*  odd because of course this is exactly why they funded and trained these security officers [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3452.96s)]
*  to do. This is what they're there. The reason that is to repress any opposition to Oslo and to the PA [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3459.7599999999998s)]
*  and to the continued central colonization of the West Bank in Gaza. So it is indeed odd. Now [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3466.3999999999996s)]
*  the anxiety persists like I said especially when Trump came to power they realized that in fact [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3474.56s)]
*  their days were numbered, that their effectiveness and their usefulness [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3482.08s)]
*  for the Israelis and for the Americans was no longer paramount. Indeed ever since [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3489.04s)]
*  Netanyahu stopped wanting to have any negotiations with the PA they realized that they were no longer [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3495.36s)]
*  of any use to the Israelis. The Israelis got all that they could get from the PA, everything that [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3501.68s)]
*  it had basically, it no longer had much to offer. It surrendered all its cards very early on and [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3507.2s)]
*  they were done with it. The Americans needed or think they needed, Trump clearly was much more [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3513.2s)]
*  reasonable in realizing that there was no need for this apparatus. We know what this game is. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3520.56s)]
*  We want basically the Jewish set of colonialism to continue. We don't want the opposition to [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3526.3199999999997s)]
*  it so we need police to repress them but we also need businesses that support American capital to [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3531.92s)]
*  profit from this operation. Hence his deal was about having businessmen and policemen run [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3539.12s)]
*  the lives of Palestinians under the umbrella of the Israeli military occupation [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3545.92s)]
*  and the arbitrary rule of Jewish colonial sectors. So yes the anxiety continues I think [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3550.56s)]
*  because they they realize that they've outgrown their usefulness and objectively they have very [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3557.28s)]
*  little more to offer really as a political apparatus. The escape last week of six Palestinian men [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3563.76s)]
*  from one of Israel's most fortified prisons has fueled fears that those six men, if they were [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3574.32s)]
*  to cross into the occupied West Bank they would need to face a second enemy after the Israeli [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3583.6s)]
*  occupation forces which is of course the PA police forces that you've described. Four of the [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3589.36s)]
*  escapees have been captured by the Israelis but the remaining two could, I mean there's been [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3594.7999999999997s)]
*  speculation in the Israeli press about where they've got to and there's a lot of [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3600.3199999999997s)]
*  disinformation going around I suppose but some of them have said that at least one of them is [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3605.44s)]
*  suspected to have escaped to his hometown Jenin in the north of the West Bank. If in fact they do [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3609.6s)]
*  turn up in the West Bank do you think that will create problems for the Palestinian authority [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3616.3199999999997s)]
*  in terms of it increasingly open rebellion in the West Bank against them? [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3621.92s)]
*  It would because of course the PA security would arrest them and hand them over to the Israelis [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3627.7599999999998s)]
*  and they might try to broker a deal wherein [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3632.48s)]
*  the Israelis should not reveal that the PA security had helped them in recapturing them [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3634.72s)]
*  or that they would rather if they did capture them and the Palestinian POWs or perhaps more [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3643.68s)]
*  precisely hostages realized that they were captured by the PA security officers they might [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3650.08s)]
*  ask the Israelis to shoot them dead before they speak to their lawyers so that they would not [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3657.68s)]
*  reveal that they had been captured by them. Remember we are dealing with thugs I mean these [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3662.88s)]
*  people were actually trained by an American general as thugs I have in mind of course Keith Dayton [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3668.4s)]
*  who trained them to be a thuggish security apparatus to be criminal and collaborators [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3675.1200000000003s)]
*  with the enemy of their people right so and their mission is described by Abbas as a sacred mission [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3683.1200000000003s)]
*  of coordinating their security efforts with the Israelis so I think you're right if they do [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3690.32s)]
*  capture them and it is revealed that they had captured them this would galvanize and mobilize [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3695.76s)]
*  more and more rebellions and revolutionary action against the PA which would lead to more and more [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3703.44s)]
*  repression of course so I think they would do their best to make sure the news doesn't go out [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3710.1600000000003s)]
*  if they happen to capture them. Remember I mean there's a bit of a it's not a symmetrical [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3720.32s)]
*  precedent but the story of the PFLP leader Ahmad Saadat I was just thinking of that yeah back in [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3727.92s)]
*  2002 if you recall the Israelis had accused of masterminding the assassination of an Israeli [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3734.32s)]
*  minister and the PA was embarrassed and not handing him over they brokered a deal I think [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3743.1200000000003s)]
*  the Jericho deal with the British and the Americans to try him and jail him in PA jails [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3749.6s)]
*  the PA jail of course as the Palestinians or the PA is treated like you know the racial [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3757.2s)]
*  inferiors and as children by the Americans and the Brits UK and American observers monitored the [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3765.2799999999997s)]
*  PA prisons to make sure that Saadat remained in prison this situation remained in operation [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3773.76s)]
*  until 2006 after the elections of Hamas Hamas had of course pledged to release Saadat once it came [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3780.1600000000003s)]
*  to power however before that happened the UK and the US monitors of the jail decided to leave the [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3787.6800000000003s)]
*  jail claiming the situation was no longer stable allowing the Israelis to invade and abduct Saadat [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3796.88s)]
*  from the PA jail clearly he was handed over by their PA friends and taken to an Israeli jail [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3804.0s)]
*  where he remains a hostage today he was held in salt air confinement until 2012 [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3813.52s)]
*  tried and sentenced by an Israeli kangaroo court for 30 years in prison and remains today you know [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3820.4s)]
*  a hostage and a POW in Israeli jails but you know we'd never heard after the elections ended [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3826.4s)]
*  and after the American engineered coup overthrew Hamas in the West Bank but not in Gaza there's [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3835.6s)]
*  never been a request or any real effort to bring Saadat back to serve his time in a PA prison so [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3843.28s)]
*  there's been already collaboration you know with the Israelis on handing over or allowing the [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3854.56s)]
*  Israelis to take possession of Palestinian hostages who are even leaders of the Palestinian [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3860.24s)]
*  liberation movement or older leaders rather than the young some of the young prisoners that have [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3869.12s)]
*  now been in jail for some four decades and who had not necessarily been part of the [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3876.0s)]
*  PLO structure as such or high or high ranking in that sense so yes there's been a precedent [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3883.52s)]
*  of the sort and I suspect that PA security would be just as harsh as the Israeli [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3891.84s)]
*  army if they were to capture the Palestinian hostages that escaped. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3899.92s)]
*  So the Palestinian authority has also been in the news lately because 14 of its security members [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3912.16s)]
*  were charged in the killing of Nizar Banat and this largely appears to be a scapegoat [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3920.3199999999997s)]
*  trial kind of reminded me of the Khashoggi I'm not sure if that's an appropriate analogy but reminded [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3929.3599999999997s)]
*  me of the the Khashoggi scandal because it what's what's what seems to me is happening here is that [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3934.56s)]
*  this is an attempt by the PA to portray the killing of Banat as an isolated incident [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3943.44s)]
*  committed by a number of undisciplined members of its security forces rather than kind of the PA's [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3952.64s)]
*  MO so the trial was reportedly delayed on Tuesday after their defense lawyer refused to show up [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3960.7200000000003s)]
*  or failed to show up. What do you think of this trial and do you think it has any kind of [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3968.48s)]
*  greater significance than an attempt to whitewash the PA's legitimacy after it was [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3976.48s)]
*  tarnished by this by the scandal? It is precisely a whitewashing but it's a whitewashing that [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3983.28s)]
*  they're pressured to do by the Americans and by the EU it's not even necessarily on their own [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3988.96s)]
*  initiative. EU funders and American Democrats want to pretend that they are supporting [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=3995.76s)]
*  you know an authority that has some rule of law and therefore they need this show trial as [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=4004.32s)]
*  Trump tried to convince Saudi Arabia to have some form of a trial and arrests for the alleged [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=4011.6800000000003s)]
*  criminals who killed Khashoggi to continue with your comparison. So I think yes it is a whitewash [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=4018.88s)]
*  but it is a whitewash at the initiative of the EU and the Americans who need it to be able to [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=4028.48s)]
*  save face with the continuing funding and support that they give the PA in to continue to repress [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSLI4c-Je4&t=4034.0s)]
