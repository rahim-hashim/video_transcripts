# How Israel massacred Israeli children then blamed it on Hamas, with David Sheen
**The Electronic Intifada:** [July 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc)
*  Welcome to the Electronic Interfader podcast. I'm Asa Winstanley. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=0.0s)]
*  And I'm here today with producer Tamara Nassar behind the scenes and with the journalist David [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=4.16s)]
*  Sheen. David is a long time contributor to the Electronic Interfader. For many years, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=10.96s)]
*  he's been reporting on Jewish extremism inside the territories of historic Palestine, first [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  occupied in 1948. That is to say, inside present day Israel itself. Now, David's most recent article [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=20.8s)]
*  for us is titled, How an Israeli Colonel Invented the Burned Babies Lie to Justify Genocide. And you [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=28.24s)]
*  can read it. Go over to electronicinterfader.net and you can read this very long, very thorough, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=37.04s)]
*  and extremely brilliantly researched article. I recommend you all do that after watching this [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=43.839999999999996s)]
*  episode. Now, many of you in our audience will already know about the infamous 40 Beheaded Babies [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=50.32s)]
*  Lie, which was invented by Israeli propagandists and how it originated in Israeli disinformation [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=57.6s)]
*  campaigns, including from groups like Zaka, which we'll get more into later in this episode. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=64.0s)]
*  Now, of course, the idea on and soon after the 7th of October was that Palestinian fighters had [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=71.04s)]
*  carried out a massacre, executing Israeli children when they assaulted the Gaza Frontier [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=77.12s)]
*  settlements on the 7th of October, 2023. This was very swiftly debunked. But what your very long and [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=83.36s)]
*  detailed article proved, David, was that the head of Israel's National Rescue Unit in the Israeli [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=91.84s)]
*  Army himself was also deeply involved in this disinformation campaign, which was a key part of [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=100.4s)]
*  Israel's justification for its ongoing genocide in Gaza. Now, this man was and is Golanwag. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=107.92s)]
*  So please explain who Golanwag is and what his role was in inventing the fake story of the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=117.04s)]
*  executed Israeli babies. Well, Colonel Golanwag has a long sorted history before he ever came to [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=124.56s)]
*  my attention. But digging back to find out where his roots were, I came to find that he was born [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=133.52s)]
*  in Hebron. He was raised in the Jewish settlement outside. That was the first Jewish settlement [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=141.60000000000002s)]
*  created after the occupation of the 67 territories in Kyriat Arba. And his father was in fact the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=147.04000000000002s)]
*  mayor of Kyriat Arba. And so he was raised from birth in the most extremist household. In fact, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=154.96s)]
*  when his father became mayor of Kyriat Arba, the first thing he did was to sign an edict, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=165.52s)]
*  making it illegal to actually conduct business with any company that hires non-Jews and hires [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  Palestinians or that has trade with Palestinians. So this is the wellspring he's drawing from. And [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=178.56s)]
*  of course, as he grows up, he goes to where does he study? He studies at the Benei David Yeshiva in [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=184.24s)]
*  the settlement of Elie in the occupied West Bank. And this has come to the attention of the media [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=192.08s)]
*  in recent years because besides receiving the Israel, the founder of the school receiving the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=199.60000000000002s)]
*  Israel prize, the most important prize in the country, this is a school that has taught [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=204.8s)]
*  the most racist ideology to its students. It's a prep program for young Israelis who are entering [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  the army and what they're taught are messages that include that literal slavery should be [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=218.16s)]
*  reinstituted and that Palestinians should be the slaves of Jews. This is literally what's taught [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=224.96s)]
*  there. Golanbach remembers the years he spent there as the best years of his life. So this is [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=231.84s)]
*  where he's coming from. And of course, this is not an odd thing to find someone like him at the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=239.04s)]
*  highest positions in the army. It may have been an odd thing decades ago, but in recent decades, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=248.8s)]
*  the far right and the Kahana movement specifically have made strenuous efforts to infiltrate every [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=257.2s)]
*  aspect of society and to take over key positions. This mainly occurred following the so-called [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=264.0s)]
*  disengagement from Gaza when Israel removed its colonies from the Gaza Strip. The far right [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=270.8s)]
*  realized, well, if we can't prevent these withdrawals on our own because the masses of [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=277.04s)]
*  Israeli society don't care enough about these settlements. So the only way that we can prevent [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=284.8s)]
*  withdrawals and of course, support further invasions and conquests is to put people in [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=290.72s)]
*  education, in media, in academia, and of course, in the army as well. So Golanbach is probably [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=299.04s)]
*  one of the most, you know, the premier example of this phenomenon of the most racist right-wing [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=307.68s)]
*  people you can imagine entering key positions in Israeli society. And then at critical moments, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=314.08s)]
*  when they become indispensable to use their position as leverage to, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=322.71999999999997s)]
*  you know, construct a reality or to, you know, leverage their position to create, in this case, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=330.64s)]
*  horrific hoaxes that then were used to incite the genocide of the Gaza Strip that we've seen in [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=338.32s)]
*  recent months. That's the origin of Golanbach. But of course, he graduated that prep school and [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=345.04s)]
*  went to the army and went on to have, you know, a quarter century career in the army. And even after [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=352.40000000000003s)]
*  he... Go ahead. And these are some of the most extremist settlements in the West Bank that you're [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=360.16s)]
*  referring to, you know, Kirit Aba, for example, Eli, you know, these are the... I mean, you could [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=366.24s)]
*  call them the vanguard, a sort of right-wing vanguard of the settler movement of the West Bank. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=374.8s)]
*  Is that, you know, is that right? Is that an accurate way to characterize where Vahk is coming [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=380.40000000000003s)]
*  from politically and religiously? Most definitely. In fact, it's worthwhile saying that he actually [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=385.84000000000003s)]
*  has a lot of cultural clout as well, because he comes from a very prestigious family. In addition [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=392.8s)]
*  to his father being the mayor of this, you know, extremist settlement, Kiriat Aba, the family is [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=399.28000000000003s)]
*  also a musical troupe. Funny enough. Yeah. This is a really interesting part of your article. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=406.24s)]
*  Yeah, they're a kind of right-wing von Trapp family. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=413.6s)]
*  Mm hmm. Well, exactly. They play, you know, charming melodies of, you know, kind of like a [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=417.68s)]
*  folksy renditions of Bible verses. And it's like, you know, Golan Vahk is playing the guitar and [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=428.24s)]
*  his siblings is, you know, ten or so siblings, and his mom and dad are the choir. And what's [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=435.12s)]
*  interesting, the reason why I bring this up is not just like an a factoid, you know, that's okay, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=442.32s)]
*  that's kind of, well, it is interesting, but it's more interesting that his family has been heard [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=447.04s)]
*  in just about every religious family. And it like, there's almost no families in Israel from [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=454.08s)]
*  the right-wing religious sector that don't know who they are, that don't have a CD of theirs, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=461.44s)]
*  that haven't heard their music played at a wedding or at a social function or in some manner. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=466.48s)]
*  Everyone is familiar with them. That's how important they are to the, you know, Orthodox [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=472.56s)]
*  culture in Israel. So in that sense, he's already an important public figure. But in another sense, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=479.12s)]
*  he's, you know, has a lot of prestige on the international stage and the professional realm, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=487.68s)]
*  because as I said, he went on into the army and became a professional soldier and served [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=492.96s)]
*  for a quarter century in the army, but then went into the reserves. And in that time, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=498.79999999999995s)]
*  his last command in the army was for six years or so, he was the commander, as you mentioned, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=503.28s)]
*  of the National Rescue Unit of the army's civil defense. So what that means is that not only [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=510.24s)]
*  there is some kind of situation that requires extraction, some kind of building collapse, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=523.2s)]
*  but also if there's some kind of national emergency from a natural disaster. So not only is his team [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=530.32s)]
*  sent to rescue people in Palestine, but also around the world. Now, everywhere in the world, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=536.96s)]
*  every country has some kind of rescue squad that's sent in to extract people when, you know, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=546.96s)]
*  calamity befalls them. But Israel, I believe, is the only country in the world where it's a military [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=553.44s)]
*  unit that does that. And so it's, you know, it's pretty easy to assume that the reason they do that [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=559.6s)]
*  is in order to buff the image of the army to have this rescue squad that it sends to India and to [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=566.5600000000001s)]
*  Turkey and to even to the United States. So he's used to doing kind of PR for the Israeli [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=573.68s)]
*  military around the world, right? Exactly. Exactly. His face is the most recognized face [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=579.76s)]
*  of all the Israeli soldiers you could say anywhere in the world. You know, he's been [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=586.0799999999999s)]
*  feted by multiple Muslim heads of state. All right. So that's the prestige he has. And precisely [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=590.0s)]
*  because of that prestige and that facial recognition, that's why he was so important [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=597.76s)]
*  in the days that followed October 7th. Because as you mentioned, in the initial days that followed [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=605.4399999999999s)]
*  the Palestinian resistance attack on Israel, there were stories starting to come out, oh, there were [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=612.56s)]
*  40 beheaded babies, 40 murdered babies. And at that point, people still felt like, okay, well, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=621.44s)]
*  that's a very, very serious claim. We need some kind of documentation or we need some kind of [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=631.84s)]
*  proof before we state this as fact. And so when there was pushback from the media, those stories [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=638.4000000000001s)]
*  fell apart because they were invented from scratch because that had never occurred. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=645.44s)]
*  And we, of course, we know this because there's we now know this because after some weeks, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=651.36s)]
*  you know, a list of all the Israeli fatalities was developed. And then it was known that, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=657.7600000000001s)]
*  no, there were no babies. There was one baby that was killed in Kibbutz Berry, and there was one [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=663.7600000000001s)]
*  fetus that was almost live and she was killed in her mother's stomach when the mother was shot [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=672.32s)]
*  through a car. So there were two babies and none of them were decapitated and none of them were [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=679.44s)]
*  burned. And so, but immediately, none of them were executed executed. None of them were executed. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=686.32s)]
*  That's also true. None of them were purposefully executed. The baby that was killed at Kibbutz Berry, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=693.0400000000001s)]
*  of course, is a horrific story, but she was held in her mother's arms as her mother was holding her [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=698.64s)]
*  in a safe room in her home. And Hamas and the men shot through the door. And that's how they [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=703.92s)]
*  killed her. So, of course, it's horrific, but it's not a savage execution or anything barbaric like [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=710.0s)]
*  that. Just to put things in the proper context. And of course, that was the allegation of the [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=716.24s)]
*  Israeli government, not accidentally. The idea was to pump up, you know, to invent the worst possible [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=720.96s)]
*  atrocities in order to manufacture consent for what would quickly come afterwards. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=728.4s)]
*  Yeah, and it's not the top. It's not going to be the topic of this episode, but this is also the [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=733.52s)]
*  time when there was the first, you know, rumors and stories and fake stories of the idea that [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=738.0s)]
*  there was a mass rape campaign by Palestinian resistance fighters during those days, which is, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=745.76s)]
*  you know, we've debunked very comprehensively in episodes of our live stream and podcast. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=752.08s)]
*  But, you know, there was all these kind of, it's very important, like you say, there was all these [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=761.2s)]
*  kind of atrocity stories being spread online, you know, by pro-Israel people, by people on, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=765.6s)]
*  by Israelis on the ground, you know, who have these kind of worst fears of the kind of settler [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=773.76s)]
*  colonial imagination happening and they're being spread all over the place. But in steps, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=779.84s)]
*  the highest levels after, as you said, you know, these stories fell apart because there was no [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=786.08s)]
*  evidence of them because they had not happened. They started to fall apart very quickly [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=790.8s)]
*  because of, you know, inquiries of journalists saying, well, where's the evidence of this? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=796.96s)]
*  And so in steps, higher levels of Israeli government and Israeli government aligned [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=801.04s)]
*  agencies such as this man, Golan Vak, so what does he do in the aftermath of the September, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=807.36s)]
*  of the October the 7th assault? And what does he say? And what is his role in this campaign? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=813.36s)]
*  Well, essentially, he begins even before on October 7th itself, he heads down to [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=821.76s)]
*  the area around Gaza that was affected these hundreds of kilometers that resistance fighters [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=830.0s)]
*  managed to secure for several hours on October 7th. And by the time he gets there, it's, you know, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=836.48s)]
*  a flame, everything is in ruins. But as the head of the rescue squad, he takes it upon himself to [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=844.8000000000001s)]
*  start collecting bodies, collecting corpses. And of course, there is an Israeli army unit that is [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=852.72s)]
*  highly trained for this specific task. They go through rigorous training in order to prepare them [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=863.36s)]
*  for the gruesome task of collecting corpses. But on that day, they were not brought into [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=868.8000000000001s)]
*  the battlefield. And in fact, in the days that followed, they were apparently, according to [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=880.08s)]
*  reporting, begging to be brought to the battlefield to carry out the task in which they were trained. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=885.04s)]
*  Egon Vach headed that off of the past. Instead of bringing in that unit, he brought in [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=890.64s)]
*  Zaka. And as we know, because EI has discussed this in detail in previous episodes of the podcast, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=898.0s)]
*  Zaka is an organization that was founded by a massive rapist and child rapist and [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=906.4799999999999s)]
*  Jewish supremacist terrorist by the name of Yehuda Mashi Sahab. And after four decades of [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=916.72s)]
*  wreaking terror and sexual terror, but he'd also managed over those years in accumulating power to [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=925.6s)]
*  insinuate himself and become one of the arms of the Israeli state essentially, or a quasi-armor [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=934.08s)]
*  of the Israeli state in the sense that he was one of these Jewish terrorists who leveraged his [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=942.32s)]
*  clout to become a first responder of the state. Zaka eventually became this group that everyone [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=949.44s)]
*  turns to when they need bodies collected after a natural disaster or after the case of a terrorist [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=958.72s)]
*  attack or a resistance attack on Israel. So this group was brought in for the purpose of collecting [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=967.44s)]
*  corpses, even though they were not professionally trained to deal with the kind of horror that [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=976.72s)]
*  befalls you when all of a sudden you see the ground littered with bloody bodies. They did not go [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=984.08s)]
*  through any training for this, and of course they didn't go through any training to give them the [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=989.2800000000001s)]
*  skills to look at a battlefield or a crime scene and determine who did what and what was the cause [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=994.72s)]
*  of death. Of course they have none of those. Their only motive is to collect Jewish body parts because [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1001.52s)]
*  they believe that their purpose, you know, because there are Jewish burial rituals according to the [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1007.6800000000001s)]
*  religious rights of Orthodox Judaism, that is their sole purpose. But because they shared Golan Bach's [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1013.28s)]
*  religious right-wing agenda and everything that implies, that's the reason that they were tapped. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1020.96s)]
*  It would be easier for them to spin these atrocity tales, and in fact that's what happened. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1029.44s)]
*  That's exactly what happened as you reported in depth. So Golan Bach brings in Zaka, but he himself, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1038.64s)]
*  Zaka is responsible for some of the most gruesome tales that we've heard so far and [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1050.48s)]
*  since of course been debunked, but Golan Bach himself, the commander of the rescue unit who [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1054.56s)]
*  brought them in, he was responsible for the worst atrocity hoaxes of all. He invented the [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1059.84s)]
*  tallest tales and the most gruesome stories, and he did so not only to incite genocide on the Gaza [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1065.84s)]
*  Strip, but he also did so in order to cover up the worst failures of the government and the most [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1074.96s)]
*  bloodthirsty crimes that it committed, that its army committed on that day, the Israeli army committed, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1081.2s)]
*  and I'm speaking specifically about what happened at Kibbutz Be'erih in the house of Pesik Cohen. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1087.8400000000001s)]
*  Right, well that's very nicely brought us on to my next question to you, which is that to say that [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1095.76s)]
*  your reporting alongside, you know, often, you know, co-writing with our colleague Ali Abu-Namah [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1102.56s)]
*  was also crucial in the very early stages of the genocide in Gaza, in proving that Israel had [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1110.24s)]
*  actually killed its own civilians and some of its own soldiers during the course of that assault. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1116.8s)]
*  Now on the 16th of October 2023, you and Ali published this article, and you were the first [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1125.6799999999998s)]
*  to report this, you know, outside social media, but you were the first to report it in, you know, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1133.6799999999998s)]
*  an actual journalistic and thorough fashion with a professional translation, which was, you know, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1139.4399999999998s)]
*  done by yourself. You are, of course, a fluent Hebrew speaker and reader, and, yes, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1146.48s)]
*  and you provide us with, you know, many of our, you along with our colleague Dina and Daniel [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1154.0800000000002s)]
*  Shunra provide us with, you know, most of our Hebrew translations for the electronic [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1161.52s)]
*  intervada, and you and Ali published this article reporting on interviews with Yasmin Parat, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1167.52s)]
*  who was one of only two survivors of the infamous, now infamous Pesik Cohen House massacre [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1174.64s)]
*  in Kibbutz Be'eri near Gaza. That is to say a massacre by the Israeli military. Now explain [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1184.0s)]
*  who Parat is and how her testimony contradicts Vah's claims. Sure. So on October 14th, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1191.92s)]
*  you know, Colonel Golanwag stood in front of that home, and he escorted dozens, if not hundreds, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1202.3200000000002s)]
*  of journalists and VIPs, officials from the United, from European Union and other countries, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1212.0800000000002s)]
*  and he claimed that within that house, first of all, that Hamas Teres had, you know, in his [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1220.72s)]
*  language, Hamas Teres had murdered and executed all the, you know, people in that house, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1228.8s)]
*  Jewish civilians, but furthermore, he claimed that they had done so by congregating them [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1236.48s)]
*  and by purposefully torching them to death, and that amongst these over a dozen Israelis that, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1244.48s)]
*  you know, Hamas resistance fighters had torched to death were eight babies, and he also claimed [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1253.76s)]
*  that he himself with his own hands extracted those babies from that house, that, you know, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1261.84s)]
*  that he should be believed because it is his word. He saw it with his own eyes, he held them with [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1270.32s)]
*  his own hands, and so based on that, as I said, you know, Golanwag is an allegedly reputable actor, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1277.12s)]
*  he's the commander of his old rescue force, and he has, you know, there's photographs of him [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1284.8799999999999s)]
*  receiving awards from the president of Turkey, this president of them being embraced by the president [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1290.08s)]
*  of Albania, and, you know, so who, why wouldn't a major media outlet take his word for it, and so [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1296.7199999999998s)]
*  they did, but of course what occurred there is nothing of the sort, and so for that we go back [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1305.84s)]
*  to October 7th. On October 7th, essentially what occurred without going into too much detail, but [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1312.72s)]
*  just enough detail to so that folks understand how different it is than what was alleged, so of course [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1319.76s)]
*  on that day Hamas fighters entered the kibbutz from numerous directions, and they [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1326.0s)]
*  attempted to take hostages, and they did take many hostages. While taking hostages, they shot and killed [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1334.32s)]
*  many people, and in that effort to round up hostages, they ended up bringing 15 [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1342.24s)]
*  captives to the house of this one woman, Pesik Owen. Most of the people in that, first of all, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1353.76s)]
*  first of all there was Pesik herself, several members of her family, some of the neighbors [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1360.24s)]
*  to her east and west, and also three others that were not from the kibbutz. One of them [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1366.56s)]
*  was actually a Palestinian from Jerusalem who had been ferrying partygoers to the Nova [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1374.8799999999999s)]
*  Rave, not too far from Kibbutz Be'eri. So just to interject a little bit there, just [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1383.68s)]
*  for our viewers and listeners who may not understand the context of that, Palestinians in East Jerusalem [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1390.96s)]
*  have a separate pass than, you know Israel has this apartheid path system where the different [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1398.72s)]
*  segments of Palestinian society have different passes. Palestinians in East Jerusalem are, in short, [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1406.8s)]
*  they are residents, they have a blue pass, and they have certain access to, let's just say they [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1412.64s)]
*  have certain access to areas of Israeli society which Palestinians in the West Bank don't, and [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1420.5600000000002s)]
*  Palestinians in Gaza certainly don't for the most part. Thank you for mentioning that, it's important [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1428.24s)]
*  to so that people understand the context, that's absolutely correct. So he ended up, he was a bus [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1435.92s)]
*  driver, he was a bus driver and he has the ability to enter 48 territories and so he did so to make [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1441.6s)]
*  a living and he was ferrying Jewish Israelis to the Nova party. And at that point he was caught [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1448.48s)]
*  by resistance fighters who came upon him, you know, they verify, they don't believe, you know, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1457.04s)]
*  they hear him speaking Arabic, but is he really a Palestinian? They end up calling his family and [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1463.6799999999998s)]
*  they confirm yes, that in fact this is our son and he is Palestinian. Anyways, they're like, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1469.2s)]
*  okay well you'll see him later, you know, and then they, for the rest of the day, they used him as a [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1473.3600000000001s)]
*  translator so that every time they encountered Israelis whom they hoped to take back to Gaza as [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1479.68s)]
*  captives and use as, you know, leverage to exchange for Palestinian prisoners inside Israel in a future [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1486.24s)]
*  deal so he would be used to translate between Arabic and Hebrew. And that's exactly what happened, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1493.52s)]
*  they brought him to Kibbutz Be'eri and they used him for that purpose. But just to mention the other, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1499.6s)]
*  two others besides him, Suheib Adlerazim was the name of that Palestinian man, the two others who [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1506.56s)]
*  were from, also from outside the Kibbutz were these two, this couple, Yasmin Porat and Tal Katz. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1512.8s)]
*  And these, this man and woman were, you know, they're lovers and they attend a party, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1522.32s)]
*  they go to the Nova party and then they, the rockets start coming in the morning so they flee [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1529.52s)]
*  the party and they flee to Kibbutz Be'eri. Yasmin is a Kibbutz member from the north of the country [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1534.08s)]
*  and so she feels she will find safety there. She enters, she knocks on the house of a resident and [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1541.2s)]
*  they allow her to come inside, you know, they're running away from the rockets so they come inside [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1547.4399999999998s)]
*  the house. Of course they don't realize at that point, no one realized, none of the Israelis [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1552.2399999999998s)]
*  realized the extent that, you know, thousands of resistance fighters had crossed the border and [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1556.6399999999999s)]
*  that this was not just 10 or 12 infiltrations. So Yasmin and her partner Tal Katz are also caught up [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1563.12s)]
*  in the assault. Hamas fighters find them and the people that are harboring them and they bring them [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1573.2s)]
*  all together into one house. So they go house to house, they capture people and they bring them [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1579.6s)]
*  together. At this point they're 15 people held hostage in the house of Pesikowin. Now what's [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1584.8s)]
*  important to remember is that we are now talking about midday when Hamas and her, sorry, when Yasmin [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1589.84s)]
*  and her partner are taken captive. Meaning that at that point most of the Israelis who would later [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1598.48s)]
*  be the captives held in Gaza were already there or on their way there and because that had occurred [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1606.56s)]
*  already from the morning, you know, from six o'clock in the morning the assault begins. So [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1615.1200000000001s)]
*  by mid-afternoon they're already gone. The only ones really that are left are the fighters who [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1620.56s)]
*  held the front, you know, and so it was those fighters who wanted to negotiate their own [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1626.96s)]
*  safe return back to Gaza and so they collected the, you know, a few more Israelis and they initiated [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1634.16s)]
*  contact with the Israeli army, with the police rather. They phoned the police multiple times saying, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1642.08s)]
*  well they actually got Yasmin to say it because they didn't speak Hebrew, but on their behalf [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1649.8400000000001s)]
*  she said we are being held here captive and there's dozens of terrorists here who are holding us [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1656.4s)]
*  captive and we're in Kibbutz Be'eri, please come. They want you to secure safe passage for them [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1664.0s)]
*  to Gaza and to bring us with them to Gaza and then once they're there safely they'll release us [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1673.1200000000001s)]
*  the next day. That's their demand and so would you please come? And so [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1680.32s)]
*  they don't really respond. It takes Yasmin calling back again and again and again, you know, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1687.68s)]
*  five or six times before they actually respond. Over the phone they, you know, demands, make their [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1693.76s)]
*  demands and there, you know, I guess at that point it's unclear how it will resolve itself, but [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1702.08s)]
*  when Israeli forces arrived eventually in the mid-afternoon they arrived guns blazing, so [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1710.3999999999999s)]
*  if there was a chance of some kind of negotiations that wasn't going to work out. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1718.3999999999999s)]
*  And this is all according to the testimony of Yasmin Porat and the one other survivor of this? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1724.56s)]
*  Exactly. As I'll go on to explain, there were no, besides those two women, there were no other [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1732.8799999999999s)]
*  civilian survivors, but thankfully there are. If it wasn't for those two we would still be accepting [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1739.4399999999998s)]
*  Colonel Vox claims as accurate perhaps because we would have no one to refute them and in fact [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1750.3999999999999s)]
*  that's the case with probably, you know, no small number of Israelis who were killed on October 7th. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1756.24s)]
*  I think one of the great unsolved and unacknowledged and unreported and probably even biased [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1763.36s)]
*  aspects of this is that, is the fact that we know so much about this particular Israeli massacre of [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1771.36s)]
*  Israelis on the 7th of October, we only know so much about it because there was two civilians [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1778.88s)]
*  who survived. How many other similar massacres were there when none of the Israeli civilians [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1784.4s)]
*  survived and we're just, you know, we're then told that they were all killed by Palestinians. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1790.24s)]
*  Yeah, I mean that's more of a rhetorical question, but yeah, if you, for now anyway, I mean [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1795.8400000000001s)]
*  this is an issue I hope to investigate more at a certain point, but [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1802.3999999999999s)]
*  continue with the story. Sure, so at this point, again, 15 hostages are being held [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1807.6799999999998s)]
*  and they're being held by about 40 or more Hamas fighters and, you know, they are set upon by [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1816.3999999999999s)]
*  Israeli forces and at first over the course of the battle, the fierce battle of crossfire in [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1826.08s)]
*  both directions according to Yasmin, you know, hundreds of thousands of bullets are flying. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1835.36s)]
*  When they arrive, when the Israelis arrive, some of the captives are held outside the house on the [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1841.44s)]
*  front lawn, the grassy lawn in front of the house, and some of them are held inside the house. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1850.96s)]
*  But all of the Hamas fighters are inside the house and so over the course of hours, [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1858.56s)]
*  bullets flying about an hour into it, the commander of the Qassam forces, you know, is on the phone, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1864.48s)]
*  presumably with an Israeli negotiator and he negotiates his own surrender. He decides, okay, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1874.8s)]
*  well, Khales, you know, there's nothing we can do. We're overwhelmed. They finally arrived. They're [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1882.56s)]
*  not going to allow us to go. I guess that was his thinking. I might as well, you know, end this [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1887.6s)]
*  alive. And so apparently what they tell him over the phone is to take a captive and, or maybe they [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1892.64s)]
*  don't tell him to take a captive, but they tell him to come outside the house, removing his clothing [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1899.6s)]
*  to gradually become naked. And he does so, but he takes Yasmin as a human shield. I suppose they [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1906.16s)]
*  didn't instruct him to do so, but for his own safety, he takes Yasmin and, you know, he doesn't [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1912.8s)]
*  grab her. He asks her to come in, but he, you know, he holds her with his hand around her neck [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1919.28s)]
*  and gradually, you know, very, very slowly, step by step by step, they, they walk forward out of the [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1925.2s)]
*  house and all of the other Qassam fighters are like, what are you doing? Stop. You know, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1932.0s)]
*  they're screaming. Yasmin doesn't speak Arabic, she doesn't understand, but they're objecting. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1937.04s)]
*  They're telling him not to surrender, but he still does it. They could have shot him. They didn't. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1941.1200000000001s)]
*  He keeps walking forward step by step by step by step. And finally he crosses the threshold. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1944.72s)]
*  He's outside the house. He crosses a little road and pushes Yasmin. They grab her and Israeli [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1951.44s)]
*  forces grab him as well, subdue him. And so now one, the commander of the forces is, you know, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1958.4s)]
*  is arrested, but the 39 or more Hamas fighters are still there, still holding 14 Israeli hostages. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1966.64s)]
*  In any case, the battle goes on for several more hours, but I guess the Israeli forces aren't able [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1975.68s)]
*  to decide the battle because they're still receiving lots of gunfire in return. And so at [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1985.04s)]
*  a certain point, after several hours, the commander of the Israeli forces at that point, who is a [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=1993.6s)]
*  general, Brigadier General Barak Hiram, he decides for his own reasons that he's not going to wait [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2001.2s)]
*  any longer. He's not going to hold out. He's just going to shift the balance by ending the battle, [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2009.8400000000001s)]
*  by using overwhelming force, by having one of the tanks at his disposal, fire shells at the house. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2019.44s)]
*  And according to Barak Hiram, he said this to the New York Times, as we reported in December, [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2028.32s)]
*  he said, you know, even at the cost of civilian casualties, he was willing to use that mega lethal [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2034.8799999999999s)]
*  force, even if it would mean that all the Israeli captives inside would die. And it wasn't that he [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2043.04s)]
*  didn't know. He knew very well because once Yasmin, you know, came over to the Israeli side, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2049.36s)]
*  she in great detail explained, well, she drew a map for them. This is the house. This is this room. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2056.56s)]
*  This is that room. This is where this person is hiding. This is where this person is, you know, [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2063.52s)]
*  lying down under a couch. This is, you know, she explained everything in great detail, how many [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2067.6s)]
*  there were on each side. And she did it again and again for every Israeli commander. She went up the [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2072.56s)]
*  chain of command and explained this all to them, you know, behind Israeli lines and in front of [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2078.7999999999997s)]
*  Pesik Cohen's house. So they knew it had incredible intelligence. They knew exactly who was alive [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2084.8799999999997s)]
*  there and who was alive was at that point, 13 of the 14 remaining Israeli or remaining civilian [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2090.7999999999997s)]
*  captives. Only one Israeli civilian captive died right at the beginning. Again, just like the one [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2099.4399999999996s)]
*  year old baby, Mila Cohen, also at Be'eri. So this, it's Haq Sitton, who was Pesik's brother-in-law. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2107.2s)]
*  He also died because again, when Hamas fighters attacked the house, again, they shot through the [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2116.0s)]
*  safe door that they were hiding in and the bullet went through, killed him. It wasn't an execution, [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2122.3999999999996s)]
*  but they did kill him, certainly. And he died. But again, only he died from Hamas bullet. All the [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2126.72s)]
*  other Israelis who died and all the other civilians who died there, there was a dozen [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2134.0s)]
*  other civilians besides Haq Sitton who died at that house. And all of them seemingly died from [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2140.48s)]
*  Israeli fire. And most of them, if not 10 of them, if not, you know, up to 10 of them died in the [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2147.52s)]
*  last, the final stroke of the battle. Because at that point, at the end of the battle, when, you [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2156.24s)]
*  know, after hours of gunfire and it was clear to Barak Hiram that as the sun was setting, [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2162.08s)]
*  that he was, this could go on indefinitely. Clearly they had enough ammunition there to hold [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2169.36s)]
*  off and it would, you know, it could last till the next day. And of course he wanted to continue [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2174.16s)]
*  on to the next battle. He wanted to close this off and move on and, you know, make a little V and [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2180.48s)]
*  continue killing. So he decides, shoot the house with these tank shells. Now, when they did so, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2187.04s)]
*  it ripped, it created shrapnel that ripped through the bodies of at least, we know 100% [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2197.2799999999997s)]
*  at least two of those Israeli captives because the other survivor besides Yasmin Porat, her name was [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2204.4s)]
*  Hadassah Dagan. She was the woman who took Yasmin and her partner in that day and welcomed them in. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2212.2400000000002s)]
*  So she was, when the Israeli forces came firing, she was on the ground outside. She was on the [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2218.2400000000002s)]
*  lawn. And so she was laying on the lawn for hours during this gun battle. And on either side of her [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2225.6800000000003s)]
*  were her partner, her husband, Adi Dagan, and on the other side, Yasmin Porat's partner, Tal Katz. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2233.1200000000003s)]
*  So she knows for a fact that they were alive up until that moment. The entire gun battle, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2240.48s)]
*  all three of them and another man are lying on the ground, still trying to avoid the bullets flying [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2247.04s)]
*  over their head, but they're alive. Up until the final stroke of the battle, General Barak Hiram [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2254.48s)]
*  gives the order to fire that tank. The shrapnel from it shreds through the body of Tal and the [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2260.0s)]
*  body of Adi. And she graphically explains how her husband bleeds to death all over her. So we know [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2267.44s)]
*  for sure that those civilians were killed by the final stroke, by the tank shelling. We also know [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2275.12s)]
*  for sure that the Hatshroni family, three members of the family who live right next door to Pesikowin, [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2281.28s)]
*  they too were killed by that final tank shelling. The reason we know that is because they burned [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2288.96s)]
*  to death. They were incinerated because their families received only ashes weeks after the [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2297.36s)]
*  battle. Yeah, Tamara, if you could put the next one on screen. Israeli child burned completely by [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2304.88s)]
*  Israeli tank fire. Another early article by yourself and Ali, which showed in and proved in detail [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2311.84s)]
*  how Yael Hatshroni was burned to death not by Palestinian fighters but by an Israeli tank shell. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2321.36s)]
*  And you've explained that in quite some detail there, Tamara. If you could scroll down to the [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2328.6400000000003s)]
*  first tweet by the at Israel account in this piece, it shows, what it shows is that the tragic [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2335.52s)]
*  death of this child along with the other 12, including her twin, yes, absolutely, whose name [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2346.48s)]
*  was Yanai. They were all killed by this, by the, well, as you've put it, certainly probably 10 of [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2357.28s)]
*  the 13 were killed by the final tank shelling and they were all killed in this onslaught by the [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2372.8s)]
*  Israeli troops on this home. And yet, as we can see here in this tweet and in other similar tweets, [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2382.48s)]
*  Israeli government accounts, social media accounts claim the opposite, that she was [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2389.84s)]
*  burned to death, as they put it here. Well, and this one is not explicit, but, you know, [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2394.8s)]
*  they're implicitly saying, well, they do say hashtag Hamas massacre. This little girl's body [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2400.72s)]
*  was burned so badly it took forensic archaeologists more than six weeks to identify her. All that [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2406.08s)]
*  remains of 12-year-old Yael Hatshroni is ash and bone and fragments. No doubt that part is true, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2411.12s)]
*  but they're saying that she was killed by Hamas, which is completely untrue, as we know from the [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2416.08s)]
*  eyewitnesses. And here's a very similar tweet by the former Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2420.8799999999997s)]
*  who's explicitly claiming that she was murdered in a home by Hamas monsters. Completely untrue. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2427.68s)]
*  By that stage, everybody knew it was untrue, but it is simply being reported as a fact by so many. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2433.9199999999996s)]
*  And your reporting has been really crucial in debunking this. And all it really required, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2440.7999999999997s)]
*  I should add, is by listening to Israeli women. We keep being told listen to and we say listen to [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2447.7599999999998s)]
*  not those Israeli women, David. Right, right. So we've been listening to Yasmine Porat and [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2456.0s)]
*  we're listening to Hadassah Dagan and just chronicling what they say. And what they say is that [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2461.6s)]
*  first of all, Yasmine notes that she was, that the Hatshronis were on the other side of the house, [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2470.08s)]
*  is where they were hiding. But Hadassah Dagan and Yasmine both note that [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2475.12s)]
*  it. Liel Hatshroni, the 12 year old girl that we just saw a photograph of, one of the hostages, [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2478.4s)]
*  that she was screaming throughout the hours long battle. The entire time, help us, scream. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2487.76s)]
*  Yasmine calls them the teenagers. She thought they were about 15 years old based on their build and [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2499.6800000000003s)]
*  maturity level, I guess. So the entire time she's screaming, and according to Hadassah, who [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2505.44s)]
*  was present for the entire battle up to the very last stroke, she says that the Hatshronis screamed [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2515.2s)]
*  up to the last moment. Meaning that she was alive up to the last moment, meaning that she definitely [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2521.68s)]
*  died from that tank fire. There's no ands or ifs about that. And so what we have at the end of a [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2527.04s)]
*  battle is dozens of Hamas fighters dead and over a dozen, you know, a dozen Israelis dead [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2536.24s)]
*  and a Palestinian citizen of Jerusalem is dead, all civilians. And now the Israeli army has to [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2546.48s)]
*  account for it. It's one thing to, you know, kill them off and conquer the territory, but now how [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2554.24s)]
*  is this going to be explained? Both to the families of the dead, also to the Israeli public eventually, [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2560.08s)]
*  and more importantly to the media who will be asking questions soon. And more to the point, [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2568.24s)]
*  we'll be arriving at Kibbutz Be'eri in just a few days time and we'll want to hear from the Israeli [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2574.96s)]
*  army as to what happened there and they will take Golan Bakh's word for what happened. And of course, [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2583.44s)]
*  this is when he spins his tall tale. He, you know, he claims that he himself took the bodies out of [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2588.32s)]
*  Pesikowin's house, but there were no babies there. There were no babies in the house. And in fact, [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2596.8s)]
*  everyone in the house was an adult, the only exception, or the two 12-year-old twins. As I [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2605.52s)]
*  said from Yasmin Porat's perspective, they look 15. So these were not runts of the litter, you know, [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2612.4s)]
*  they were healthy adolescents and there's no way anyone could mistake them for twins. Yeah, in any [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2618.8s)]
*  case, this is one of the things that comes out later when specifically the propagandists from [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2625.44s)]
*  Zaka get called out on their lives many months later. They say things like, [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2632.8s)]
*  oh, well, you know, when there's burned remains, you can't necessarily tell, you know, you can't [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2642.1600000000003s)]
*  tell whether they're a child or a baby, you know, there's no way these 12-year-old pre-teens could [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2647.6800000000003s)]
*  be mistaken for babies. Exactly. And, you know, I find that really insidious, that discourse that [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2656.0s)]
*  occurred, because, you know, on one hand, you are specifically drilling down into details and claiming [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2662.64s)]
*  that, you know, the casualties were of infancy age, and you are also specifying that they were [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2672.0s)]
*  executed, and you are discerning that they were, that this was done in the most gruesome way. And [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2682.4s)]
*  then when actual evidence is brought before you to show you that that's the furthest from the truth, [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2688.48s)]
*  then you're like, oh, well, why do you care about the specifics? Isn't everything else bad enough? [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2693.76s)]
*  You know, so you can't have it both ways. If you're going to drill down into specifics, then you have [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2699.36s)]
*  to be held accountable, because these are not neutral, you know, claims. These claims are [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2704.4s)]
*  very incendiary, and if you're going to make them, you're going to be held accountable for them, but [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2713.6s)]
*  no one has. And certainly Golan Bach has not, because after he did this, you know, tour de force [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2716.8s)]
*  hasbara mission to explain away the mass cannibaling of, you know, a dozen plus [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2724.7200000000003s)]
*  civilian captives just at that one location only, you know, is more Israelis were killed at that [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2732.4s)]
*  structure than any other place on October 7th. So first of all, you explain that away, and you [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2740.7200000000003s)]
*  cover it up and turn, you know, leverage that into incitement to genocide. So, of course, [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2746.48s)]
*  the next step that occurred, you know, after the Golan Bach went to the media, then it actually put [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2754.0s)]
*  the general who commanded the Israeli forces there and who instructed the tank commander to [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2762.32s)]
*  fire these shells that, you know, killed these Israeli captives. It put him in an awkward situation, [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2769.2s)]
*  because even though, yes, from minute one, he had gone to the media himself to kind of cover his [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2775.12s)]
*  own butt, and he had invent already invented lies about we found babies shot in strollers and [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2781.8399999999997s)]
*  carriages, you know, stuff that of course, did not occur. He invented it outright. So he is already [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2788.7999999999997s)]
*  inventing blood libel's himself. But and of course, he was already big upping himself and taking [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2795.7599999999998s)]
*  credits. Oh, yeah, I acted so heroically, I, you know, saved these hostages. He's taking credit for [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2801.84s)]
*  those two those two survivors, and as if it was something that he did that that kept them alive, [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2810.0s)]
*  you know, when just the opposite occurred. So he's already, you know, inventing lies from minute one. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2816.08s)]
*  But what once Golan Bach tells the world that what he found there were, you know, 19 or more [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2822.48s)]
*  birth incinerated civilians, including eight burned babies. So now the commander there, [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2832.1600000000003s)]
*  Barack Hiram, he's in a spot because he never said anything about burn babies before he never said [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2839.76s)]
*  about burn anyone before and he never certainly never talked about infants. So now he's got to [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2846.1600000000003s)]
*  cover himself in his own story. And so then he has an interview with Ilana Diane, [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2853.6800000000003s)]
*  who is the head of, you know, the chief investigator of who've done it's like Israel's [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2860.72s)]
*  60 minutes, you know, the most respected investigative news program. And so she [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2866.0s)]
*  interviews him and it's the most softball interview you can imagine, you know, she's almost like [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2872.3999999999996s)]
*  massaging him through it. And almost, you know, this is, you know, she's holding his hand the [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2877.6s)]
*  whole time, essentially, and she allows him to spin additional tall tales. And now he brings in [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2884.72s)]
*  he's kind of grandfathered those eight infants that according to General Bach were, you know, [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2891.7599999999998s)]
*  burned to death. Now, he doesn't say burned to death, I guess that was too that would have been [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2898.7999999999997s)]
*  too much to say so but he does accept the number of eight. And he doesn't call them babies, he [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2902.72s)]
*  calls them children, but he claims, just like Bach, that resistance fighters that Palestinians [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2908.32s)]
*  gathered together concentrated these children, all the Israeli civilians that they concentrated [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2915.76s)]
*  them but including these eight children, and bound them up, and then shot them to death, executed [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2922.32s)]
*  them. So he grandfathers Bach's blood libel just downplaying a little from burnt to bound and [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2930.6400000000003s)]
*  shot to death and but but that's his claim. And again, this is never challenged in the media. Now, [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2938.56s)]
*  since that time, you know, after our reporting and the reporting of others, you know, it came out that [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2947.36s)]
*  what really happened at the Pesik Owen house, so it was no longer tenable for him to claim that, [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2953.6000000000004s)]
*  you know, eight people were, eight babies were bound and shot to death there. So when he's [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2959.84s)]
*  interviewed by the New York Times, an article that was released on December 22nd, if memory serves, [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2967.04s)]
*  of 2023. So he's no longer claiming these eight babies, but at the same time, New York Times is [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2973.44s)]
*  not holding him to account for those eight babies. And so now, you know, comes correct and says, yes, [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2978.56s)]
*  I gave the order to fire the tank shell. And I did it, you know, regardless of whether there were [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2984.4s)]
*  civilians still alive there. But no one has ever held him to account for his lies. And no one has [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2989.36s)]
*  ever held to account. Ilana Diane, Israel's premier journalist for shepherding that line, you know, [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=2995.76s)]
*  for for bringing that to the fore. And she's never apologized for that or never corrected the record. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3003.5200000000004s)]
*  Yeah, second, yes. So the mainstream media, as you said, has never questioned this or held them to [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3010.4s)]
*  account in any way. And it's been down to us and a few other independent outlets like the gray zone, [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3016.96s)]
*  and wonder why it's to do so. Now, you've mentioned it already in passing, but the background to all [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3023.2799999999997s)]
*  of this, of course, is the Hannibal directive, which is a secretive military doctrine, which was [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3030.0s)]
*  established by the Israeli military initially in secret, it later came out in the mid 1980s. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3038.64s)]
*  And it was named after an ancient Carthaginian general Hannibal, who poisoned himself rather [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3045.44s)]
*  than be captured alive by the Roman Empire. The order aims at stopping Israelis from being [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3050.88s)]
*  taken captive by resistance fighters who could later use the captives as leveraging prisoner [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3056.48s)]
*  swap deals. And I wrote a piece on it. Well, well, we've I mean, you know, you in your Golan [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3063.52s)]
*  Vach piece, you get into the background of it. I've written a few pieces on it, several others [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3071.84s)]
*  have written pieces on it. This is probably one of the more significant ones where I wrote about [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3076.48s)]
*  in January. And it's it really confirms from Israeli reporting from Ynet specifically, and [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3081.52s)]
*  from no less than Ronan Bergman, who is also a New York Times reporter, that the [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3091.28s)]
*  Hannibal directive was not only not only happened, it didn't only happen on the 7th of October, but it [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3098.48s)]
*  was ordered from the top. It was ordered from the headquarters in Tel Aviv from midday. And as [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3107.44s)]
*  actually we're filming this, you know, six months after my article here, the Haaretz, the Israeli [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3114.72s)]
*  liberal designers newspaper daily newspaper, Tel Aviv newspaper has finally reported taking [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3126.0s)]
*  them all these many months, finally reported in English, confirming something quite similar, [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3131.28s)]
*  and actually revealing some a couple of new points. We'll get into that article in another [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3136.56s)]
*  episode, I think. But there was there was a second piece that I wrote as well, which gets into some [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3143.76s)]
*  of the detailed history of how the Hannibal directive relies on a long history of a sort of [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3152.56s)]
*  national murder suicide pact among Israelis. But in your article in the Golan Vah article, [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3158.0s)]
*  that you wrote, there was a quote that tomorrow, I don't know if you could go back to the Golan Vah [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3166.7999999999997s)]
*  article and scroll down to this particular quote that I'm about to read. If you there was something [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3172.24s)]
*  in your reporting on, you know, the what Golan Vah did and Barak Hiram and this whole long story [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3179.92s)]
*  that you've been explaining, where it says there was a quote, I just want to read out the whole [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3186.48s)]
*  because it really, it really stuck with me. Right. And it's funny. Yes, that's right. I'll be [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3191.2000000000003s)]
*  chiffoning. Exactly. It says, a relative of three of the civilian Israel, three of the civilians [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3199.84s)]
*  Israel incinerated by tank shell inside the Cohen house, the Pesik Cohen house, 12 year old [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3207.92s)]
*  Hatsaroni twins, Yanai and Liel and their 73 year old great aunt and guardian Ayala complained to [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3213.92s)]
*  Israel's national broadcaster, Can, that Israel's actions on the battlefield were a failure from a [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3221.6s)]
*  cost benefit analysis. So this this is what he said, Omri Shafrani, this is what he's the relative [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3227.92s)]
*  of these dead twins. He says, quote, I am willing to pay a price that we will kill our civilians in [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3234.24s)]
*  exchange for something else. Omri Shafrani told Can, the Israeli broadcaster, but what is the [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3240.3999999999996s)]
*  something else to advance quickly? Why? Why did we with certainty save anyone by shooting a shell [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3247.6s)]
*  here? That's end of quote. That's what he said. Now, we can't quite show the clip because it was [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3254.64s)]
*  on Israeli TV and that I checked their YouTube channel that the link that you sent us and it's [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3260.24s)]
*  actually blocked to people from outside Israel from watching the clip, but you've watched it [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3266.24s)]
*  and you translated that quote. So what do you make of that astonishing willingness to pay such a price? [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3274.56s)]
*  Well, it's a really interesting phenomenon because, you know, since we can say that, you know, the [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3281.6800000000003s)]
*  tactical or the strategic mistake that Hamas made on that day was overestimating the importance [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3291.76s)]
*  that Israeli lives have to the Israeli government and maybe even also to the Israeli people. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3301.76s)]
*  And here Omri is, you know, explaining it perfectly. He's saying, look, I am willing to [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3309.12s)]
*  pay a price. I'm willing to sacrifice the lives of my cousins and bitter as it would be. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3319.76s)]
*  It can be justified or at least excused or at least understood or contextualized. If [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3328.16s)]
*  we, you know, if we benefited in some way, but how did we benefit? There was no benefit and that's [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3334.7999999999997s)]
*  there was a benefit, but the benefit was not to the people. The benefit was in the minds of all [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3340.72s)]
*  the people who have told people like Omri Shifroni to shut the hell up since then, because as you [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3347.2799999999997s)]
*  might imagine, just like Omri, there are other Israelis who feel that the price paid was too [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3353.68s)]
*  high, that in the event that Israeli civilians are caught and taken captive, that they should not be [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3359.84s)]
*  immediately executed, you know, by decision of an army commander, just in order to quickly capture [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3365.6000000000004s)]
*  territory and to avoid having to pay a price. No, not everyone agrees to that. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3374.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, we've got a tomorrow, if you can show that tweet, that not everyone agrees to that. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3378.6400000000003s)]
*  As you said, the same with Omri Shifroni, there's a photo in this tweet from recent Israeli [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3385.6s)]
*  protests criticizing the Israeli government for carrying out the Hannibal Directive. And you can [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3391.6s)]
*  see here the translation, the what it says on the road Hannibal government, and this is in front of [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3397.6s)]
*  the Israeli military headquarters in Tel Aviv. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3403.2s)]
*  So obviously, there are some Israelis who are, you know, horrified, you know, these are generally, [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3408.8s)]
*  you know, secular Israelis who, for the most part, are probably relatives of hostages, some of them, [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3414.0s)]
*  right? Some of them, certainly. Yeah, definitely. But the point is that, you know, if you serve in [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3419.44s)]
*  the Israeli army, and still most secular Israelis do, then it means that you're not going to be [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3425.6s)]
*  willing to potentially die on the battlefield yourself. So everyone from that camp is more or less willing to [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3432.56s)]
*  make some kind of sacrifice. The question is for what? So here we have people saying, no, you can't. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3438.4s)]
*  But what we found in the days that followed is that this seemingly becoming a minority opinion in Israel, [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3443.2s)]
*  because in response, there was an immense amount of pushback from the Israeli army, [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3451.52s)]
*  of course, from the government ministers on the far right and, you know, leading figures on the, [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3458.3199999999997s)]
*  you know, the religious camp. But their voices were much louder, you know, and the discourse has been, [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3463.7599999999998s)]
*  no, we must support such commanders who make these decisions. These are the kinds of commanders who [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3474.48s)]
*  we want to lead the Israeli army. We need more of him. And he should be praised, Barak, because now, [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3481.44s)]
*  you know, thanks to Omri and other family members of those who died at the Pesikon House, they did [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3488.7200000000003s)]
*  succeed in the sense that they managed to force the army to investigate this particular battle before [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3495.04s)]
*  the end of the overall onslaught. So, you know, the fact that the Israeli army is not going to be [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3501.52s)]
*  this particular battle before the end of the overall onslaught on the Gaza Strip, you know, [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3507.84s)]
*  the army initially said, we're not looking into anything until after this is all over, [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3513.1200000000003s)]
*  but they demanded, they said, they insisted, and they preserved the Pesikon House so that it [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3517.52s)]
*  wouldn't be demolished and the evidence wouldn't be erased. So they, and in fact, in the days to [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3522.2400000000002s)]
*  come, just in days from now, we will see the publication of the final army report, which [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3527.52s)]
*  will be a whitewash. Yeah, I want to, okay, well, you've answered my final question really there, [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3533.7599999999998s)]
*  but just before we get on to that tomorrow, if you could show that article that I dropped in the chat [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3538.24s)]
*  earlier about the Israeli general who killed Israelis and then lied about it. This is what [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3546.64s)]
*  you're referring to. So, you know, these are two very senior Israeli officers. So the main article [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3552.56s)]
*  we've been discussing today is about Golan Vah, Colonel Golan Vah, and this other article from [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3561.12s)]
*  December last year, Israeli general killed Israelis on 7th of October. This is about Brigadier [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3570.64s)]
*  General Barak Hiram, who actually fired the tank shell or ordered the firing of the tank shell, [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3575.8399999999997s)]
*  certainly on the ground anyway. And this is the man who was really responsible for those 13 deaths [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3581.3599999999997s)]
*  of 12 Israeli civilians and the one Palestinian Jerusalemite in the Pesik Cohen house on the 7th [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3590.88s)]
*  of October. And he then, as you mentioned, went on Israeli high profile, Israeli national TV, [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3599.6800000000003s)]
*  lied about it and who is now being investigated because it had, as we discussed earlier, because [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3605.6800000000003s)]
*  it has been such a, this is the one of these massacres, these Hannibal massacres, you could say, [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3613.28s)]
*  that we know about in so much detail and for certain, you know, for 100% definite that it was [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3620.64s)]
*  a Hannibal massacre of Israelis by Israel, we know in detail because of these two surviving civilians. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3627.2s)]
*  So because there has been so much exposure, there is an investigation that has been going on into [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3636.16s)]
*  this tank fire on the Pesik Cohen house, very limited in scope in that way, but nonetheless, [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3643.2s)]
*  it has happened of the investigation by Brigadier General Barak Hiram. Now, my late, [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3648.88s)]
*  what I heard earlier this week, my latest information is that the investigation has [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3656.8s)]
*  concluded, has been handed in to the top of the Israeli military, but it hasn't been released as [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3660.8s)]
*  of this filming. So we expect that may happen soon. So what do you expect from the investigation? I [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3665.76s)]
*  mean, you've already said there that you think it's going to be a whitewash. I do. And, you know, [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3672.8s)]
*  the main reason is because we've already seen leaks from it. You know, over the course of weeks [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3679.1200000000003s)]
*  and months, the Israeli army has purposefully leaked certain aspects of their report. So they, [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3683.52s)]
*  you know, they're basing their judgment on some of the others, the Israeli soldiers who fought there. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3690.8s)]
*  And, you know, they've come to the media themselves on their own accord in order to defend [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3698.7200000000003s)]
*  the record of Barak Hiram as his actions are called into question. So, of course, [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3704.56s)]
*  the things that they've said are, again, complete lies and completely detached from reality. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3710.32s)]
*  You know, essentially they're, you know, at least the soldiers that have been quoted so far [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3717.12s)]
*  are essentially trying to create a narrative in which it was only after the firing of the [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3723.52s)]
*  tank shells that the Israeli captives were killed and that they were killed by bullet holes. Okay. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3731.92s)]
*  Well, first of all, we're never going to really know what happened because the people who conducted [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3739.84s)]
*  those autopsies and who examined those bodies were from Israel's, you know, antiquities, [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3745.44s)]
*  Department of Antiquities. Well, the Department of Antiquities is run by the Jewish Power Party, [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3754.16s)]
*  the Kahanes Party, the most explicitly racist party that, you know, openly advocates for, [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3760.08s)]
*  you know, trying to expel non-Jews, Palestinians from all areas of the country. So this is the [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3768.64s)]
*  people who are, you know, issuing these reports. But beyond that, it makes no sense because, again, [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3776.0s)]
*  we talked about the survivor, Yasmin Porat, and the other survivor, Hadass Dagan. Hadass, as I said, [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3785.04s)]
*  she laid there the entire time on the grass outside the house and she was the only person to serve, [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3791.44s)]
*  was the only civilian to survive until the end of the battle. And she says that after those tanks, [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3799.84s)]
*  shells were fired, that that was it, that there were no other sounds. And she says that there was [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3805.44s)]
*  one more gunshot and that's it. So we can presume that every single person in the house, [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3812.64s)]
*  including all the Israeli captives and all of the Palestinian resistance fighters were killed. One [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3820.08s)]
*  of the resistance fighters was badly wounded and did not want to be taken captive or was, you know, [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3825.8399999999997s)]
*  bleeding out and wanted to end his life. So that's who he shot. And that was because it was only one [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3833.12s)]
*  bullet. He could not have shot an Israeli hostage and then shot himself because that would have been [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3838.32s)]
*  two bullets. Hadass Dagan says there was one bullet fired at the end. That's it. So there is [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3844.4s)]
*  absolutely no way to claim that, you know, what occurred there was a tank fire and then the Hamas [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3850.0800000000004s)]
*  men decided to shoot all the Israelis that were still alive and then shoot them. No. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3858.0800000000004s)]
*  Makes no sense. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3863.36s)]
*  It makes no sense. It's complete garbage. And [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3864.32s)]
*  our reporting is also brought to the fore. One of the Israelis who fought on the Israeli side, [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3868.32s)]
*  soldiers who fought on the Israeli side, who completely reject that assertion. So there's no [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3875.28s)]
*  way that it could occur. But again, that's what that's the story that the army seems to be putting [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3880.48s)]
*  together and will likely be released at the end of the week. So they're hoping to paper over [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3887.44s)]
*  everything. Now, will that suffice? You know, it's very difficult to say because [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3893.04s)]
*  if you look at, as I mentioned, you know, the army relented and agreed to conduct this investigation [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3900.64s)]
*  even before the whole campaign was over. When they agreed to that, you know, the families [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3907.04s)]
*  said, okay, well, we'll wait for the results of, you know, the conclusions of the army. So that [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3914.56s)]
*  was back in January, if memory serves. At that point, there were no protests in the streets. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3919.12s)]
*  There were no Israeli centrists who were demanding the end of the war. You know, there were no [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3924.08s)]
*  hostage families. You know, maybe hostage families were silently protesting outside the, you know, [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3931.44s)]
*  military compounds in Tel Aviv, but there were no masses in the streets burning tires. You know, [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3938.08s)]
*  there were no people screaming in throngs, we demand new elections for a new government. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3944.56s)]
*  And that has occurred in recent weeks. So we'll be in a different situation when the army releases [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3950.8799999999997s)]
*  its report in some days. And as if it is as expected, and they deny any responsibility and, [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF52hZ8Dqfc&t=3958.7999999999997s)]
