# Student intifada sweeps US campuses
**The Electronic Intifada:** [May 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q)
*  Hello and welcome back to the Electronic Intifada podcast. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Nora Barrows-Freedman. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3.6s)]
*  Across the US and around the world, students and faculty have been engaging in a wave of [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=5.72s)]
*  protests, demonstrations, and encampments on their campuses to demand that their institutions [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=10.98s)]
*  divest from companies that profit from Israel's apartheid and genocide, and they've been met [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=17.12s)]
*  with nothing but violent repression from police and smears from corporate media, pro-genocide [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=22.44s)]
*  lawmakers, and Zionist groups. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=28.16s)]
*  Let's get right into it. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=31.0s)]
*  Joining me to talk about all of this is Bryce Green, a student at the University of Indiana [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=32.16s)]
*  and a writer with Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=36.68s)]
*  He was on the Electronic Intifada livestream about a month ago. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=40.2s)]
*  Welcome back, Bryce. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=43.22s)]
*  We're also joined by Bikram Gill, an assistant professor of political science at Virginia [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=44.22s)]
*  Tech. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=49.56s)]
*  Both Bryce and Bikram were arrested on their respective campuses for protesting against [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=50.56s)]
*  the genocide. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=55.04s)]
*  We're also joined by Sharif I, an organizer and filmmaker with Columbia University Apartheid [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=56.48s)]
*  Divest, Jake E., a member of Students for Justice in Palestine at CSU Los Angeles, and [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=62.08s)]
*  Samuel Ahmed, a member of Stewards for Justice in Palestine at UCLA. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=68.96s)]
*  Thank you all for being with us today on the Electronic Intifada podcast. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=74.34s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=77.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, good to be here. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=82.92s)]
*  I want to begin with the students in LA and at Columbia to talk about what happened in [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=83.92s)]
*  the past few days at your encampments. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=91.04s)]
*  Samuel, you're at UCLA. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=94.28s)]
*  Let's start with you. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  Can you tell us about the attack first by Zionist thugs on Tuesday night and then the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=98.76s)]
*  brutal use of force by the LAPD after that to clear the encampment? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=105.0s)]
*  What happened over the last few days? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=110.3s)]
*  Okay, sorry. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=113.92s)]
*  I couldn't find the unmute button. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=114.92s)]
*  It's okay. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=118.6s)]
*  Yeah, honestly, as much as the Zionist attacks and the police response was abhorrent, I can't [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=119.6s)]
*  say that we were all surprised inside the encampment. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=126.88s)]
*  Starting from Thursday morning when we set our camp up all the way until the final escalation, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=130.72s)]
*  we have just seen an unprecedented amount of harassment. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=138.08s)]
*  We were called names. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=143.16s)]
*  I personally was called a couple of slurs, many in the camp report the same by these [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=144.16s)]
*  Zionist agitators, aggressors, whatever you'd like to call them. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=149.12s)]
*  And we saw that as the UCLA administration refused to police them in any way, they grew [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=153.84s)]
*  bolder and bolder. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=160.04s)]
*  Over Friday night, we had music blasting all night and loudspeakers. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=161.98s)]
*  Saturday night, we had an amount of Zionist protesters that we'd never seen before just [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=166.04s)]
*  taunting us and rushing our barricades and playing music until maybe 5 or 6 a.m. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=174.32s)]
*  And then that was quickly followed by a need to expand in order to keep our encampment [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=181.23999999999998s)]
*  safe and then falling into Sunday with the largest Zionist rally we saw. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=187.0s)]
*  And then on Monday, much of the same into the escalation on Tuesday where they assaulted [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=193.88s)]
*  us with fireworks, with tear gas, with mace, with pepper spray. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=201.74s)]
*  I personally actually don't even know anyone that I've talked to that hadn't been pepper [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=205.16s)]
*  sprayed or maced or tear gassed that night. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=209.26s)]
*  I personally had a pallet thrown at my head. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=211.88s)]
*  There were bricks thrown, rocks thrown, and the police stood by idly watching. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=214.35999999999999s)]
*  Campus security stood by idly watching. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=220.68s)]
*  The extra security they had hired stood by and actually seemed almost entertained by [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=223.16s)]
*  the attacks, laughing. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=228.04s)]
*  We have video of all that. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=229.92s)]
*  And the university just refused to do anything for five hours, just let us get attacked. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=232.51999999999998s)]
*  It was frankly unbelievable. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=238.76s)]
*  And it seems like almost sanctioned by the university. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=240.68s)]
*  And then I was just showing a video of the LAPD shooting tear gas canisters and rubber, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=245.04s)]
*  they call them rubber bullets, but they're pretty, I mean, they call them also less than [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=253.92s)]
*  lethal weapons, but they cause a lot of damage to people's bodies and faces. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=259.08s)]
*  Yeah, can you talk a little bit about the response by the LAPD and what happened? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=267.32s)]
*  Yeah, well, the administration has deemed that we were unlawful and we were supposed [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=274.35999999999996s)]
*  to disperse, apparently because the Zionists attacked us the night before, which was an [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=282.35999999999996s)]
*  unbelievable reason. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=287.96s)]
*  They called us a focal point for attacks, which was simply unbelievable for them to [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=288.96s)]
*  first allow us to be attacked and then use that for the reason. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=296.35999999999996s)]
*  And then the police came in and started to attack us in a sweep, just highlighting their [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=299.52s)]
*  hypocrisy. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=305.15999999999997s)]
*  And when the sweep came, it was hundreds and hundreds of fully riot-geared police. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=306.15999999999997s)]
*  We frankly just held our own line as we had done the night before and we had to do time [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=313.44s)]
*  and time again. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=320.2s)]
*  And they started off by releasing a barrage of just flashbangs, just trying to use intimidation [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=322.2s)]
*  against our barriers over and over again as we held our line. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=328.12s)]
*  They fired plenty of rubber bullets. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=332.72s)]
*  Apparently they're supposed to fire them towards the ground. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=336.36s)]
*  They absolutely did not. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=338.64s)]
*  At one point, we witnessed them aim at people's heads and we have a couple injuries that reflect [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=339.64s)]
*  that, that people had to go to the ER. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=347.36s)]
*  And their push over the course of the night, their use of intimidation against a group [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=350.72s)]
*  of entirely peaceful protesters fighting for divestment of our schools, money of our investment [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=357.44s)]
*  in weapons of destruction, of indiscriminate bombing, of the genocide in Gaza. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=364.92s)]
*  Evil was probably the only word that I could really describe what had happened. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=373.20000000000005s)]
*  We had over 200 arrests that night and I can't speak too much on that because of the legality, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=377.04s)]
*  but it was incredible, unbelievable. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=383.16s)]
*  And in terms of now, where does the encampment sit at this point? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=388.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean, what's happening now after the LAPD, after these Zionist thugs attacked the encampment? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=395.36s)]
*  What has happened to that momentum and that protest at UCLA? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=402.88s)]
*  I mean, honestly, we were a bit surprised just by the administration's approach to this. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=408.32s)]
*  They probably approached it in the worst way that they could, allowing our encampment to [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=415.08s)]
*  stand strong for as long as it did, showing people throughout the school, the community, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=419.23999999999995s)]
*  the strength of our movement and allowing everyone to see what we're really about, what [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=425.23999999999995s)]
*  we were calling for is just like a just cause. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=429.47999999999996s)]
*  And then allowing the Zionists to attack us and sweep, it just has rallied the community [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=432.67999999999995s)]
*  to our side in a way that we haven't seen before. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=436.76s)]
*  So, I mean, I can't believe what they were thinking and our community is stronger than [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=439.32s)]
*  ever, people just reaching out in support, asking what they can do. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=443.71999999999997s)]
*  And we plan to use that momentum to call for this divestment, to call for transparency [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=447.08s)]
*  in our investments, to call for the abolition of a leasing of pro-Palestinian voices, to [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=452.12s)]
*  call for the boycott of university affiliated Israeli programs and to make a statement from [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=456.59999999999997s)]
*  the university that names genocide as genocide and names occupation as occupation. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=464.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=469.72s)]
*  Thanks so much, Samuel. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=471.08000000000004s)]
*  I want to turn to Sharif at Columbia University. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=473.16s)]
*  You're a member, an organizer with the Columbia University Apartheid Divest, which is not a [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=477.40000000000003s)]
*  new coalition. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=482.36s)]
*  It's been around for years. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=483.64000000000004s)]
*  Can you talk about, I mean, it was just a historic two-week encampment [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=487.88s)]
*  on campus at Columbia that was just attacked in the most vicious way, not just by the NYPD, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=493.79999999999995s)]
*  which came and arrested and beat protesters up, but also by the administration, by Menou [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=504.59999999999997s)]
*  Shafik, the president of the university, who has not just invited the NYPD onto campus to [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=512.8399999999999s)]
*  clear the encampment and beat up her own students, but also has essentially militarized the campus. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=521.32s)]
*  Now, NYPD is going to have a presence on campus until after graduation. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=528.2s)]
*  Can you talk a little bit about what's been happening at Columbia? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=535.24s)]
*  In the aftermath, there have been allegations of sexual assault against the NYPD, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=540.7600000000001s)]
*  and so much of it has been very difficult for students to process not being able to go to their [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=547.0799999999999s)]
*  own campus. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=552.84s)]
*  The campus has been locked down for a few days now, and so they're only letting essential [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=553.48s)]
*  personnel and students who live in the dormitories actually stay on campus. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=558.36s)]
*  In terms of how things went down, of course, this is the between the last arrest round and this one. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=563.16s)]
*  It's the first time in 50 years that the NYPD has come onto the campus. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=572.68s)]
*  It's the first time we have seen them come in and kind of take ownership of the entire place [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=576.92s)]
*  and make it their own and arrest us during the removal of everyone inside. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=581.88s)]
*  A gunshot went off inside the building. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=590.28s)]
*  We found out that was confirmed by the DA. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=592.4399999999999s)]
*  Students were thrown downstairs, beaten. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=595.0799999999999s)]
*  Of course, so much of it happened so quickly, and so we also don't know the scale of everything [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=597.96s)]
*  that happened. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=604.04s)]
*  At least 1,000 cops made their way onto the campus. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=605.0s)]
*  Basically, before that, the university had laid siege to the students that were inside [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=609.64s)]
*  the campus as well by making it completely inaccessible and not allowing for little water [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=614.12s)]
*  inside. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=618.28s)]
*  A lot of it was just incredibly vicious, very fascist, and frankly, in the same beat, the [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=619.26s)]
*  president, Manu Shafik, constantly said that she was doing this to keep students safe. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=629.26s)]
*  It just is so ironic and so much of a contradiction to have the university president [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=635.42s)]
*  frame this entire situation in this way. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=640.86s)]
*  The camp was the safest place on campus. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=643.26s)]
*  It was loving, beautiful, created an amazing sense of community, and so much of us had [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=645.82s)]
*  felt for the first time that we had a space on the campus because so much of what has [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=651.2600000000001s)]
*  happened over the past few months has been very intense repression, a lot of disciplinary [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=655.2600000000001s)]
*  charges, suspensions, and of course, the arrests. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=659.98s)]
*  It's come to a head, and the entire university now is in dismay. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=663.2600000000001s)]
*  At the same time, a lot of divestment resolutions have passed through individual schools. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=668.38s)]
*  Barnard passed a divestment resolution with over a 90% passing rate. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=672.78s)]
*  The Columbia Law School also passed a divestment resolution. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=678.38s)]
*  Columbia College passed one, I think it was over 72%. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=681.3399999999999s)]
*  It's becoming crystal clear that the entire university wants divestment to happen, and [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=685.5s)]
*  that Manu Shafik is beholden to the billionaire donors that are very much very angry at us [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=689.9s)]
*  for speaking up for challenging the university and for challenging the status quo. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=695.98s)]
*  At the same time, for us now, we're doing a lot of smaller autonomous action. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=700.7s)]
*  Students are taking organizing to their own hands. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=705.5s)]
*  Outside of Mir Shafik's mansion last night, I want to say at least 100 students gathered [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=708.94s)]
*  and did a midnight scream to basically make sure that she wouldn't be able to sleep too [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=714.14s)]
*  well in spite of everything she's been doing to us. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=719.74s)]
*  We're going to keep up the organizing every single day. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=724.86s)]
*  For us, a lot of it is about also slowing down and taking care of each other and making sure [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=728.62s)]
*  that we are good because a lot of us have not slept properly, have not eaten properly. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=732.78s)]
*  It's been very difficult for us. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=738.4599999999999s)]
*  I want to echo what was said by Samuel from UCLA. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=740.38s)]
*  The outpouring of love and support from New York City and the entire country and the world [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=744.54s)]
*  has been incredible to behold. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=749.18s)]
*  That's really moved us. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=751.9s)]
*  It says so much about where the people in the streets and the camps are going and how [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=753.26s)]
*  far away university administrations and the politicians on every level are from recognizing [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=758.78s)]
*  that they have to reckon with their own actions and their own truth. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=763.9s)]
*  I showed a tweet of a vote of no confidence that the American Association of University [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=768.86s)]
*  Professors just voted on against President Shafik at Columbia. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=776.78s)]
*  Can you talk about the movement to hold her accountable and what this says about where [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=783.42s)]
*  university presidents are at? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=796.14s)]
*  They're willing to throw their students and faculty into extremely violent situations. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=798.22s)]
*  As you said, all in the name of supposedly student safety. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=804.54s)]
*  As a coalition, we have not pushed for her removal as university president because we [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=811.42s)]
*  want to center divestment as our main demand. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=817.5s)]
*  An amnesty for all the students have been charged and suspended and arrested. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=821.3399999999999s)]
*  We also have been pushing for Columbia to stop its gentrification of Harlem. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=825.3399999999999s)]
*  Columbia has an eminent domain over 30 city blocks which potentially allows them to displace [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=829.9000000000001s)]
*  tens of thousands of people. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=836.3000000000001s)]
*  We want to get rid of that eminent domain as well. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=838.86s)]
*  We want the NYPD off campus. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=842.1400000000001s)]
*  We've been very focused on those demands primarily. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=843.9000000000001s)]
*  We have not supported the effort to remove her as university president. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=846.86s)]
*  Although we do understand the sentiment and we do think she has been incredibly problematic. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=851.9000000000001s)]
*  We have waited for the CC of Columbia. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=856.1400000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=860.46s)]
*  Baroness Shafik. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=861.6600000000001s)]
*  Thank you so much, Sharif. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=864.7800000000001s)]
*  Jake, I want to turn to you. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=866.46s)]
*  The encampment at CSULA is fairly new and very visible. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=868.46s)]
*  Talk to us about the encampment, how it's been so far, and how students there are organizing [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=878.86s)]
*  when you see how the LAPD has been brutalizing students at your nearby campus and at UCLA. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=886.7s)]
*  Your audio is a little... [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=899.6600000000001s)]
*  There you go. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=904.22s)]
*  It's gotten wise to what I'm doing and is trying to understand. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=904.7s)]
*  There you go. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=907.98s)]
*  Okay, we'll make it work. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=909.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=911.02s)]
*  So the encampment is fairly new. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=913.02s)]
*  It's only three days old. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=915.02s)]
*  We started on May Day. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=916.6999999999999s)]
*  The organizing has been... [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=919.26s)]
*  It's been surprisingly smooth thus far. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=923.9s)]
*  I think because the LAPD has been focused on a lot of the other campuses, we've been new. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=927.9s)]
*  It's been really, really helpful to get a lot of advice and a lot of training [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=937.42s)]
*  from the other campuses that know how to deal with the police, know what to expect, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=944.22s)]
*  things of that nature, as well as getting solidary and support and material support [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=949.1s)]
*  from the other campuses. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=954.78s)]
*  For right now, I think we're mostly focused on trying to get as many people as we can out [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=957.1800000000001s)]
*  because there's power in numbers and that's the only way we're going to be able to [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=961.5s)]
*  do anything effective. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=966.78s)]
*  As it stands now, I don't think the university sees us as much of a threat. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=968.7s)]
*  I think we have seen a little bit of police presence on campus, not openly, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=974.22s)]
*  but there have been a lot of plainclothes officers, a couple of police cruisers around [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=980.86s)]
*  campus, although they haven't come right in front near the encampment thus far. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=986.0600000000001s)]
*  But it's hard to say. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=993.1s)]
*  I think as it stands now, we're all very... [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=998.3000000000001s)]
*  We're not exactly worried thus far about police violence. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1001.1s)]
*  We think that probably we have some time before the police try anything on us, but [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1010.5400000000001s)]
*  yeah, I don't know. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1020.7800000000001s)]
*  I think we're just trying to prepare and get as many people out as we can, get as [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1021.58s)]
*  much supplies as we can, have a good barricade training, things of that nature. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1024.86s)]
*  That's great. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1032.86s)]
*  Excellent. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1034.4599999999998s)]
*  Thank you so much, Jake. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1035.02s)]
*  And Bryce, tell us about what you went through at Indiana University. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1037.6599999999999s)]
*  I want to get your... [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1046.62s)]
*  Not just have you talk about what you've been part of, but also you're a media analyst, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1048.22s)]
*  you're a media critic. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1056.22s)]
*  I also want to ask you about how you're seeing the propaganda machine work at full speed [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1059.8999999999999s)]
*  against the student encampments. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1068.9399999999998s)]
*  But let's start first by having you explain what happened at Indiana University. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1070.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1076.54s)]
*  So Indiana University's IU Divestment Coalition, we put together an encampment on Thursday morning, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1077.4199999999998s)]
*  typically in the spot that's designated for quote, free speech activities. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1085.8999999999999s)]
*  But what we didn't know is that the day before the encampment was supposed to get up, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1090.78s)]
*  the administration had decided to change the policy in the middle of the night. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1096.54s)]
*  They had a select committee to change the policy of that meadow, it's called Dunn Meadow, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1100.22s)]
*  to prevent temporary structures from coming up during the day, which was previously allowed. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1106.22s)]
*  And so we put the structures up, the university called the police department on this, the local [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1111.74s)]
*  IU PD, what they ended up calling the state police, the Indiana state police, who came in with [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1117.02s)]
*  armored vehicles, military level assault weaponry, shotguns, assault rifles, they had choppers [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1124.78s)]
*  circling in the sky, they even had a sniper on the roof aiming at children. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1131.34s)]
*  And this was for the sole reason that there were tents in an unauthorized space on campus. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1135.98s)]
*  So the police moved in, they arrested about two dozen people on that first day, and then they [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1142.9399999999998s)]
*  cleared out. Of course, we're resilient and the camp went up again the next day and, you know, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1149.1799999999998s)]
*  there was no harassment from the police. And of course, but the next day, the police came back [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1156.38s)]
*  again, the state police, again with this military level of force, the assault weapon, snipers on the [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1162.7s)]
*  roof again, you know, armored vehicles, etc, etc. Again, just because we put two tents up in a park. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1168.6200000000001s)]
*  And the police moved in and this is when I was personally arrested. Students were hit with [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1177.0200000000002s)]
*  trespassing charges. I was hit with a five-year ban while everyone else was hit with a one-year [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1182.86s)]
*  ban from campus. And we're currently- Five-year ban? [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1189.58s)]
*  A five-year ban from the IU Bloomington's campus. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1193.26s)]
*  Wow. Yeah. And, but I mean, it's clearly, these are clearly tactics designed to intimidate students [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1196.78s)]
*  to make them fear the very act of speaking out. You know, I made a comparison a while ago, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1203.74s)]
*  while the orders of magnitude of the suffering can't be compared, the logic of imperial violence [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1210.8600000000001s)]
*  can be. And I compared what's going on here to what's called mowing the lawn in Gaza, where for [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1217.26s)]
*  the very crime of even raising their heads up and daring to speak out and resist their oppressors, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1223.5s)]
*  the Palestinians are regularly murdered by Israel just to prevent them from getting the idea that [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1229.5800000000002s)]
*  they can resist. A minuscule version of that is replaying on campus, where students decide that [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1235.02s)]
*  they want to take their university into their own hands and they don't want to be complicit in [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1241.58s)]
*  genocide. For that very act of speaking up, they're met with riot shields, again, military levels [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1246.1399999999999s)]
*  of force. This isn't designed to safeguard the student's safety, as they always say. They always [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1252.94s)]
*  use safety as a pretext. But again, the only violence that came from the, that came in Dunmeto [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1259.26s)]
*  came from the police that were sick on the students by the administration. And now we've [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1266.54s)]
*  endured other things, including the police. We've had many pro-Israel students come by. And again, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1272.3s)]
*  one of your earlier guests mentioned something that we have experienced as well is the use of [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1280.14s)]
*  extremely obnoxiously loud speakers to blast music throughout the night right by the camp. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1285.58s)]
*  They blast music during prayers. They will come over and yell racial slurs. They will sexually [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1291.98s)]
*  harass some of our female organizers. It's pretty awful. But the university doesn't seem to be [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1298.22s)]
*  concerned about that. That doesn't warrant snipers. That doesn't warrant military assault vehicles. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1304.86s)]
*  What warrants the military response is too tense in protest of a genocide. And I think a lot of [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1309.58s)]
*  these students are realizing the true nature of the state and realizing the true nature of their [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1315.5s)]
*  universities. And now you mentioned the media angle to this. Now I haven't been as plugged into the [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1320.54s)]
*  media ecosystem over the last week because of this encampment. Even though I'm not allowed on campus [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1328.78s)]
*  after Saturday, the encampments have still continued to stand. And I am on city property [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1336.86s)]
*  on the sidewalk as much as I can in solidarity. But the media angle is still surprising. It's [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1343.82s)]
*  one thing to be a media analyst and hear cop statements and you know, oh yes, cops lie all [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1351.5s)]
*  the time. It's one thing to know that maybe journalists might not fully understand the [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1357.26s)]
*  context of a protest movement that they're covering. It's one thing to understand that [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1361.9799999999998s)]
*  on an intellectual level and see it happen in other cases. It's an entirely other thing to have [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1365.9s)]
*  it happen to you. To have a news outlet say that Intifada translates to death to all Jews while [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1371.42s)]
*  putting your face on the screen, a picture of me chanting on the screen, accepting police statements [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1379.9s)]
*  at face value without any evidence. The police, even though they made it clear that they were [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1387.1000000000001s)]
*  there because of the tense, what they tried to tell the media and the general public is that [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1392.22s)]
*  they went in because they were worried that our hate speech would turn into violence. There was [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1397.74s)]
*  no mention of that by the police on that day. Of course, any journalists on the ground could tell [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1403.42s)]
*  you that student journalists have been documenting this pretty well. But the larger media outlets, [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1408.3s)]
*  they didn't seem interested in what the actual facts were. They heard a quote from the cop, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1414.6200000000001s)]
*  so they just stuck it in. They did their job according to them. But that's what I think is [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1418.86s)]
*  the larger trend of the media coverage of these protests. I don't know if friends in UCLA, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1425.02s)]
*  Columbia and others could corroborate that, but local media doesn't seem to be well equipped to [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1431.26s)]
*  understand serious protest movements for social justice and especially the issue of Palestine and [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1439.1799999999998s)]
*  the ongoing genocide in Gaza. Thanks so much, Bryce. Bikram, I want to get your two cents on [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1445.5s)]
*  your arrest at Virginia Tech. You are a member of faculty. What happened last week at Virginia Tech [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1454.86s)]
*  and talk about the solidarity by faculty to protect their students' rights to protest this [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1464.14s)]
*  genocide and to protect them against state repression. Right. I'll start by just sharing [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1478.7800000000002s)]
*  that I was actually at Cornell University the two days before the arrest happened. I wasn't there [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1489.74s)]
*  when the encampment started. I had been invited by some student groups there to speak on Palestinian [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1499.66s)]
*  resistance there. I was there when many of the students at Cornell were suspended. But when I [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1504.6200000000001s)]
*  was at Cornell, one thing that I saw was that faculty were very prominent in protecting the [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1510.54s)]
*  encampment and being present to make sure their students were not going to be left alone [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1516.1399999999999s)]
*  to deal with this. We saw that at NYU a couple weeks before then where 12 faculty, I believe, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1522.1399999999999s)]
*  were arrested as they had formed some sort of protective ring around the encampment and their [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1527.02s)]
*  students. That was something that many of us were thinking about here at Virginia Tech. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1533.34s)]
*  Just some background on that is Virginia Tech has since October taken a very clear line in favor of [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1538.7s)]
*  the genocide like most institutions have. But they've been very explicit about it, releasing [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1547.66s)]
*  a statement in October condemning Palestinian violence, expressing sorrow and grief for [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1553.18s)]
*  Israeli lives that are lost, lighting up the administrative building in Israeli colors, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1560.7800000000002s)]
*  and then when there's a demand from students to condemn Israel's genocide against Palestinians to [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1565.66s)]
*  express sorrow and grief for Palestinian lives, to light up the buildings in Palestinian colors. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1572.38s)]
*  Of course, this is denied repeatedly. It doesn't matter what the change in terms of the level of [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1578.6200000000001s)]
*  violence being inflicted on Palestinians, whatnot. The administration has taken a clear line since [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1584.94s)]
*  then. Some of us faculty have since then took a position to make clear to our Palestinian students [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1592.46s)]
*  and their allies and organizers on campus that we were going to be here with them, to stand with them [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1599.58s)]
*  so they would not have to deal with what is quite frankly anti-Palestinian racism. This is a very [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1605.5s)]
*  specific category of racism we should be discussing here on campus. That's been the setting. It's a [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1611.42s)]
*  very hostile climate since October. I think as faculty, we've viewed it as our duty to be there [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1617.42s)]
*  with our students, particularly if we're serious about the things we teach such as decolonization, [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1624.38s)]
*  those of us who are scholars of race, imperialism, etc. That's one setting. Then as it's proceeded [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1631.74s)]
*  since October, the students have been denied and obstructed and discriminated against every time [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1639.42s)]
*  they've tried to raise the demands in any formal place of university governance. The undergraduate [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1646.22s)]
*  student center elsewhere, the university consistently comes in to undermine our Palestinian students and [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1653.9s)]
*  Palestinian organizers when they try to press demands around divestment, when they try to ask [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1659.18s)]
*  for a condemnation of the genocide, etc. We have been working with these students for several months. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1663.42s)]
*  Then I think as the encampments took hold and started spreading, of course students here [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1671.02s)]
*  felt motivated not just by the national and global movement, but I think as happens on other campuses, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1678.8600000000001s)]
*  an impetus was again that they had tried through various channels and means to press these demands, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1685.5s)]
*  but they found an administration that broke its own rules repeatedly to deny even the hearing of [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1691.3400000000001s)]
*  these demands in governance spaces. In that light, I think that's what's forming and informing [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1698.7s)]
*  why students took it upon themselves to organize the encampment. Now what I can say about what [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1706.06s)]
*  happens is the encampment went up one week ago today, it went up last Friday, and what I can [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1710.14s)]
*  say what happens is the encampment goes up and eventually the police come. I want to echo what I [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1716.94s)]
*  think was said from Columbia and maybe elsewhere that the encampment, from both what I saw and what [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1723.58s)]
*  I heard, was a very beautiful space with people coming together, probably the most diverse space [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1729.4199999999998s)]
*  on Virginia Tech campus, coming together to fight a genocide that their institution is complicit in, [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1734.54s)]
*  people are learning and reading and praying together on site. It's a form of a public university, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1740.46s)]
*  I like what somebody said, taking back the university, seeking to democratize the university, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1747.02s)]
*  and this is something that, you know, it was a very powerful space and when the police come on Friday, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1753.42s)]
*  there was an agreement that was made that if the students chucked down the tents, they could stay [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1759.74s)]
*  there for as long as they want, and so you know that was not something the students are necessarily [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1765.3400000000001s)]
*  happy to do, but they did so and still managed to camp out and stay overnight and continue with the [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1768.8600000000001s)]
*  spirit of the encampment, but with the understanding that this would provide them safety on campus. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1773.5s)]
*  When I return and I go to the encampment on Sunday, again I encounter a really inspired, [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1779.8200000000002s)]
*  motivated, beautiful space and then the police show up on 2 30 and basically go back on their [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1786.94s)]
*  word of what they said on Friday and they come and they say it's time for you all to leave [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1793.98s)]
*  within two hours and everybody was quite shocked and this felt like, you know, this was like going [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1798.6200000000001s)]
*  back on their word and you know, so we all kind of all everybody was assembled there, gathered [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1804.9399999999998s)]
*  to speak about what was going to happen and the students made a decision that they were not going [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1811.58s)]
*  to leave because this was the university that once again had lied, which they had been repeatedly [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1816.9399999999998s)]
*  doing for several months, once again went back on its word, was once again applying the rules [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1822.3799999999999s)]
*  specifically differently when it comes to Palestinian students, so they decided it was [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1827.58s)]
*  time to take a stand to hold this space and also I think what everybody is mentioning here, we can't [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1831.58s)]
*  lose sight that the primary issue is standing against this horrendous genocide and pushing for [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1836.3s)]
*  demands that will finally end the impunity with which Israel is able to repeatedly inflict such [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1842.9399999999998s)]
*  massacres and horrendous violence, both of a daily sort and of the sort we've seen over the past [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1849.1799999999998s)]
*  several months, so a decision was made to make this stand and I think for us as faculty, for those [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1855.02s)]
*  you know as myself and four other faculty who were arrested, two from my own department, to the [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1860.3s)]
*  department of political science, you know we made the decision that there was no way we could watch [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1864.14s)]
*  our students get arrested, so we made a decision to stand with our students and to you know to be [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1868.94s)]
*  there in solidarity with them because you know they had not done anything wrong, if anything it's [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1876.94s)]
*  the administration that should be brought up on charges and investigated for the way they have [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1882.8600000000001s)]
*  violated their own rules over the past several months but especially this past weekend and you [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1889.26s)]
*  know even a bigger point than that is if our students are to oppose a genocide in which [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1894.7s)]
*  children have been killed at a rate that you know no one has seen in recent memory, you know [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1901.02s)]
*  Palestinians would be starved at a rate I don't have to share, I know this is all very familiar [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1906.3s)]
*  to the electronic and to the audience, you know that this is actually the correct stand to make [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1909.98s)]
*  and the university is making a decision here to use retression to continue its investment in the [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1916.78s)]
*  genocide, so what I would just say very very clearly is that this faculty you know it is our [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1922.1399999999999s)]
*  duty to be there for our students especially when the administration abandons them and at that [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1927.02s)]
*  moment we weren't we were not going to leave them to what ended up being actually quite a hostile [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1932.06s)]
*  police takeover of the encampment on their own. Yeah thanks so much for that Bikram. Yes Sharif [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1939.18s)]
*  at Columbia I want to come back to you there is already some federal complaints being filed to [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1947.1s)]
*  the Department of Education on behalf of students with civil rights organizations like Palestine [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1956.3799999999999s)]
*  Legal. Can you talk a little bit about the ways that students and civil rights organizations, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1962.4599999999998s)]
*  lawyers, legal experts are fighting against this kind of repression? [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1971.98s)]
*  Yes for context a few months ago there was a chemical attack in which two former IDF soldiers [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1978.3s)]
*  and current students basically used a skunk bomb of some kind, a chemical weapon, and set it on [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1987.74s)]
*  students that were at a pro-Palestine protest and the university named NYPD said that they would [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=1997.9s)]
*  investigate and nothing is covered the investigation and AJ plus actually made a documentary in which [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2003.8200000000002s)]
*  they gathered all the different footage that they could find and confirmed that it was in fact the [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2009.66s)]
*  two students threw the clothes they were wearing and then removing their masks and putting their [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2015.1000000000001s)]
*  mask back on and then them having something in their hands that they didn't set on students. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2018.94s)]
*  Of course the university has failed to come up with anything conclusive, the NYPD has also failed [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2025.3400000000001s)]
*  and so it's very similar to what happened to UCLA recently in terms of the Zionist attack and then [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2031.58s)]
*  being labeled a clash by the media being misrepresented in the university and the police [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2035.98s)]
*  failing to do anything whatsoever. So in terms of anti-Arab, anti-Palestinian, anti-Muslim racism, [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2041.3400000000001s)]
*  students have been getting docs for months, they've had their addresses put out, they've had [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2048.94s)]
*  death threats sent to them and it's been very very consistently the case. The university failed [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2055.9s)]
*  to do anything other than come up with the anti-doxing resource group which is measly and [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2060.46s)]
*  practically maudlin. There is however an anti-Semitism task force in which a Jewish [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2067.26s)]
*  professor reached out to this task force and asked for a definition of anti-Semitism and the [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2073.26s)]
*  university failed to respond with any sort of definition or the term and so he then asked the [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2078.14s)]
*  right question and said in this case it seems you're going to very likely include anti-Semitism [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2083.74s)]
*  under the umbrella of anti-Semitism and that's a problem and they again failed to come up with a [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2089.42s)]
*  suitable answer and so when we talk about what's happening in Columbia of course there were different [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2095.58s)]
*  hijabi students, some women, who were asked at one point to remove their hijabs to be able to [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2101.1s)]
*  be allowed to enter the campus and so we're seeing so much of this racism each and every single day [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2109.5s)]
*  as a student of color. A lot of the people in the encampment were students of color, a lot of the [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2116.38s)]
*  students who were doing security were students of color and there was also a student who was [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2122.46s)]
*  physically assaulted by two frat boys who managed to sneak into the campus and of course the university [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2125.98s)]
*  has said and done nothing about it whatsoever so when we think about the way the policing has [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2130.62s)]
*  gone down, we think about the way everything the university has done has been absolute failure. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2136.22s)]
*  When we put it all together it just seems like it's by design. It's by design that the university [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2142.2999999999997s)]
*  is racist, it's by design that they fail to investigate anything and everything that happens [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2148.38s)]
*  to Arab Muslim and pro-Alestinian students and that it's by design because we are all primarily [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2152.62s)]
*  students of color. Zionist students on the other hand can make claims that have no basis of truths [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2159.1s)]
*  whatsoever, there's no evidence of them and those claims will then be investigated as fact [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2167.1s)]
*  and it's happened quite often. It's very much the case that the opposing narrative gets centered, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2174.62s)]
*  it gets held, it gets heard and followed through upon and that's not the case for us and so when we [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2181.02s)]
*  see what's happening with Palo Legal and this federal investigation we're happy with it, we [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2187.66s)]
*  hope it actually amounts to something that's true to the experience we have all collectively had. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2191.58s)]
*  We do not have faith in the investigation actually being able to do that but we hope it does [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2199.02s)]
*  and so a lot of it for us has been like a question of how do we actually hold the university [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2207.58s)]
*  accountable first and foremost as students? How do we confront Meneer Shafik's inability to actually [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2214.06s)]
*  care for students of color as their lives are getting destroyed left and right and how do we [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2220.22s)]
*  also deal with the fact that the university is simultaneously willing to stick the NYPD on us [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2225.42s)]
*  and claim that it's for safety? So everything the university does is the opposite of what it says it [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2231.18s)]
*  is doing. Everything the NYPD has claimed about us has been insane. I think there was one 63-year-old [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2236.94s)]
*  Palestinian woman who was labeled a terrorist even though she just came to eat some hummus and stop [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2245.9s)]
*  by the camp and see everything and just enjoy herself and so a lot of it has just been deeply, [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2251.7400000000002s)]
*  deeply racist and we've seen that in the comments made by Eric Adams, we've seen it in the comments [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2257.98s)]
*  made by the White House. Everything about our encampment has been incredibly peaceful. There [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2262.62s)]
*  was a report recently said that 99% of all pro-Palestine activism on student campuses [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2267.18s)]
*  has been peaceful and yet we are constantly being called violent even though it is these Zionist [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2272.94s)]
*  students who have been repeatedly violent, have been repeatedly doxing students, entering students' [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2277.5s)]
*  tents and photographing the inside of tents, posing as press even though they are not press and then [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2281.5s)]
*  revealing themselves in the way that they are going about filming people. So it's been very [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2287.58s)]
*  unsafe for us, been consistently unsafe. Nothing about this has been welcoming or done for our own [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2292.22s)]
*  safety whatsoever and we just hope that that's crystal clear to the public because the media [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2298.8599999999997s)]
*  plays into this narrative very intensely and will label us racial slurs. We use words like [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2303.8199999999997s)]
*  terrorists and so for us, you know, a lot of us being Muslim, having been labeled those slurs for [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2311.3399999999997s)]
*  all of our lives, we recognize that it's racism, we're aware it's racism and we draw upon, you know, [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2316.7799999999997s)]
*  the work of Edward Said in terms of talking about covering Islam and Orientalism. It's the same [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2322.14s)]
*  thing. It's just happening here and it is in fact a boomerang like Foucault said. It is the university [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2326.8599999999997s)]
*  and the NYPD and the government doing everything to scare us and doing everything to make sure [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2333.1s)]
*  that whatever Zionists do was unpunished and at the same time that they can do it with complete [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2337.74s)]
*  support and impunity. Thanks so much Sharif. Yeah, Samuel, I want to ask you about how students [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2344.78s)]
*  are, and this is a question I think for everyone, like how students are looking at, you know, [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2356.78s)]
*  what do these administrations think they're going to do by calling in, you know, these [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2364.7000000000003s)]
*  militarized police forces by smearing students in the media? Like do they really think that students [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2374.22s)]
*  are just going to say, yeah, you know, you're right, it's fine to support a genocide, we're happy with [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2380.4599999999996s)]
*  how our, you know, tuition dollars are spent and we'll just shut up and, you know, go home now. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2386.8599999999997s)]
*  Like what do they actually think? Do you think that there's some specific intention or is it [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2394.3799999999997s)]
*  just kind of like this, you know, reflexive response when students are engaged in protest [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2401.18s)]
*  that the response is just to shut it down if it's some, you know, if it's an issue that [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2409.8999999999996s)]
*  the administration doesn't agree with? Yeah, I mean, sorry, it's one that these institutions are [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2414.2999999999997s)]
*  so ingrained in their systems of power, their punitive, like histories that, frankly, I think [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2424.6200000000003s)]
*  they're good, it's just hard for them to even consider other options, but two, they just believe [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2433.98s)]
*  that intimidation here is key. I think they both undermine like the intelligence of their students [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2438.78s)]
*  and especially at such a prestigious university, I think they just don't, they believe that [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2447.82s)]
*  intimidation just works on students despite the boatload of courses at UCLA that are offered that, [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2455.34s)]
*  you know, center human life, the values of human life, empathy, and the values that higher education [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2463.6600000000003s)]
*  systems are going to care about. Gene D. Block is obviously, he's a chancellor and his press [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2470.54s)]
*  releases or emails out of his students have just been a very clear emphatist of the fact that he's [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2480.46s)]
*  an extension of the Zionist project. He's incredibly complicit in his near tactics as well as the denial [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2487.74s)]
*  of any sort of genocide in Daza or the occupation of the Palestinian people. And so he hopes to [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2496.3s)]
*  reinforce that in every message that he sends and intimidate the students that he can and hopefully [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2503.5800000000004s)]
*  misinform the students that maybe in the Netherlands are intimidated. But obviously, [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2511.42s)]
*  the way that they've handled this over the past couple of days and the support, the influx of [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2517.7400000000002s)]
*  support that we've gotten has just been a testament to the intelligence of students and [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2521.66s)]
*  a continuation of the long history of movements that are currently repressed and then later [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2530.22s)]
*  celebrated and championed as, you know, in writing to the South African apartheid and even recently [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2534.94s)]
*  but their ability to digest from fossil fuels. So we expect to be a continuation of that history. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2542.14s)]
*  So it's not surprising. Thanks for that, Samuel. Bryce, what's your take on the intention behind [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2548.3s)]
*  these just like, I mean, disproportionate isn't, it doesn't even cover it. It's just like, you know, [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2556.54s)]
*  assault on students wherever they are doing these encampments. Yeah, I made the comparison earlier [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2563.1800000000003s)]
*  to mowing the lawn in Gaza. Yeah. I think it applies. You know, if you're Israel and you want [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2569.5800000000004s)]
*  to make sure that all of your people are safe, that there is no more violence in the region and [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2577.34s)]
*  that no one wants to, you know, attack Israel for any reason. Well, there's behavioral changes that [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2582.3s)]
*  they could make that would make that less likely to happen. They could end the occupation, they [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2589.42s)]
*  could lift the seeds, they could implement equality for everybody between the river and the sea, [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2593.6600000000003s)]
*  but they choose not to. They choose to come down with violence. They choose to incite [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2598.46s)]
*  rave. They choose to murder families and kill people. I mean, it's, it's not rational. It's [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2603.58s)]
*  not logical from an outsider perspective, but the internal logic of these people and [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2608.86s)]
*  Israel of state violence in general, which America has a key part is that any descent [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2615.34s)]
*  needs to be met with massive displays of violence. That's the only way you can [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2621.02s)]
*  maintain what the Israelis call deterrence capability. Another word for that is fear. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2626.06s)]
*  The students have to fear the universities. Otherwise the people running the universities [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2632.54s)]
*  feel like they're not doing their job the same way. The same way the Palestinians have to fear [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2637.1s)]
*  the Israelis. Otherwise the Israeli generals aren't doing their job. Is this going to lead to [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2641.98s)]
*  peace and justice? No. Is this going to lead to a better university environment? No. But the [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2647.34s)]
*  administrators don't seem to care. They are that committed to this project of Israel that even [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2653.58s)]
*  sending in riot squads to disperse a peaceful student engagement. It's not crazy. It's normal. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2661.1s)]
*  That's a rational thing for them to do. The same way it's rational for an Israeli Zionist lunatic [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2669.02s)]
*  to use white phosphorus on a hospital. It's difficult to make sense of for the average person, [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2675.42s)]
*  but just because we don't understand it doesn't mean that they don't. This logic is embedded in [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2682.94s)]
*  Zionism and in America and in the empire at large. It's in every history book and we're seeing the [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2688.3s)]
*  same thing. Yeah, absolutely. Jake, I want to come back to you as well. Talking about these state [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2695.5s)]
*  campuses, CUNY schools in New York and CSUs in California, there's also a [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2706.46s)]
*  class dimension that's at play too. Most state schools are where a lot of working class folks go [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2717.5s)]
*  and they've been just looking at what's happening at Cal Poly Humboldt in Northern California [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2730.22s)]
*  and the just outrageous repression by state forces and the administration. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2736.86s)]
*  What's the significance of smaller, less visible state schools also getting involved in this? [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2743.1s)]
*  How important is it to expand these encampments? [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2749.66s)]
*  I think there is a couple of different ways in which this is significant. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2757.66s)]
*  One, a lot of the way it's optics. A lot of the way the mainstream media has tried to frame these [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2765.9s)]
*  is, oh, it's just a bunch of entitled rich kids on rich campuses. They're just coming out to [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2771.9s)]
*  try and make this about them and they're just hopping on a track, etc. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2781.1000000000004s)]
*  That's certainly not true. I know, I think the violence from the police proves that. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2788.3s)]
*  But regardless, this also proves that being on these state campuses with students who [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2801.26s)]
*  are in a lot more vulnerable positions, maybe not more vulnerable positions, but also in [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2807.6600000000003s)]
*  vulnerable positions are obviously a lot more non-white, a lot more working class, [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2814.06s)]
*  and maybe more visibly have a lot more to lose. I think that that can help counter that [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2823.5s)]
*  framing of the issue. I think also it's important to get as many people in as many campuses as we [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2833.58s)]
*  can involved. One, to gain a lot of experience from this. But two, also because if it's only [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2843.74s)]
*  one campus and the police come in and they violently break it up, that may not necessarily [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2854.22s)]
*  be the end of it. They may start another encampment. But it also means that it's only one thing for the [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2861.9799999999996s)]
*  police to focus on. It's only one thing for the news to focus on. And so I think having a lot of [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2869.5s)]
*  different campuses involved helps with spreading the movement, spreading visibility, but also [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2875.18s)]
*  fitting the police presence so they can't necessarily impose violence on everywhere all at once. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2883.26s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, no, that's a really good point. Thank you so much for that, Jake. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2890.78s)]
*  Bikram, I also want to ask you about ideological intentions behind the state repression. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2895.82s)]
*  Where the student movement goes from here? You've been involved for a long time [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2908.7s)]
*  as a student and now as a member of faculty. Can you talk about the turning point right now [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2914.62s)]
*  that students and faculty are finding themselves in when it comes to the broadening and more [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2924.78s)]
*  militant movement for justice in Palestine? Yeah, what do you see there? Oh, you're muted. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2931.34s)]
*  Yeah, so I think I would, you know, I think to begin with, you know, something Bryce mentioned around, [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2943.1000000000004s)]
*  and I really appreciate this point, like there's a similarity in terms of the logic through which [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2949.42s)]
*  you see, you know, the Israeli state, how it practices a mowing the lawn tactics, always [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2956.2200000000003s)]
*  trying to restore a deterrence capacity, you know, thinking about how that's happening [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2965.82s)]
*  on campuses today. And I think that's really important because, you know, [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2971.7400000000002s)]
*  I really appreciate that link because, you know, we often say that the Palestinian resistance, [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2974.94s)]
*  the Palestinian refusal to submit is actually exposing many contradictions across the entire [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2980.54s)]
*  world system, right? So we're seeing that it's bringing, you know, many, the U.S. imperialism [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2987.18s)]
*  to crisis, and it's bringing institutions in the U.S. to crisis because they're being exposed [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2993.26s)]
*  to what they really are, which are, you know, institutions that like to claim [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=2997.9s)]
*  to be about diversity, equity, inclusion, or whatever, but really in the end cannot move [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3003.26s)]
*  beyond upholding U.S. imperialism, especially as that requires a certain kind of anti-Palestinian [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3007.6600000000003s)]
*  racism and obviously the violence that is inflicted on Palestinians. But at the same time, [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3015.0200000000004s)]
*  as we have seen in Palestine, the forces of repression, the forces of imperialism [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3021.7400000000002s)]
*  are encountering today a very different reality in which, let's say, in Palestine itself, [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3027.5s)]
*  the Palestinian resistance and Palestinian society as a whole, we take a whole-of-society approach, [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3034.78s)]
*  is proving itself to be capable of withstanding and responding to the violence of the Israeli [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3039.74s)]
*  state and U.S. imperialism, right? We're seeing, of course, really unacceptable, horrific levels [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3047.5s)]
*  of violence, this is a horrendous genocide, like we said, so much starvation and targeting [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3055.66s)]
*  of children, doctors, journalists, etc. But we're not seeing, actually, Israel achieve any military [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3065.02s)]
*  objectives on the ground in Gaza. That's very clear. That is why they are constantly threatening [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3071.8199999999997s)]
*  to invade Ra'afah. That's why they're dangling all of these threats because they're not able [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3076.22s)]
*  to actually impose victory. They're trying to impose their terms through other means, [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3080.14s)]
*  whether through starvation or otherwise, right? But the problem they're in is that it is the [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3085.8199999999997s)]
*  resistance, whether in Palestine or in Yemen or across the region, that responds to each act of [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3091.3399999999997s)]
*  repression by only growing stronger. We're seeing this over the past couple of decades and especially [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3096.7s)]
*  into today, that is the forces of resistance of anti-imperialism, anti-colonialism in the region [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3102.22s)]
*  that are more rational, that are more strategic, that respond to each round by deepening their base [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3107.98s)]
*  and refining their tactics and advancing their strategic aims. Now, I would maybe piggyback on [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3115.18s)]
*  some of Bryce's points in saying we're seeing a similar dynamic unfolding in the student movement [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3122.78s)]
*  in the United States across campuses. You know, there's that slogan, the more they try to silence [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3127.98s)]
*  us, the louder we will be. The more that they repress, it's very clear that it is the case that [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3132.62s)]
*  there's more resistance, right? So I'm thinking, I'm seeing on the one hand, whether Columbia or [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3138.38s)]
*  elsewhere, each act of repression is met with the growing of the movement. And we saw that here at [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3144.14s)]
*  Virginia Tech. On Sunday, when the police moved in to clear the encampment, we had upwards of a [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3149.9s)]
*  thousand students come out to support the encampment, which is really unprecedented for Virginia Tech. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3156.38s)]
*  So the repression, the police sweep, the arrests, as they're seeking to now repress the ability of [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3161.1s)]
*  students to organize and speak out, it only mobilizes further parts of the campus, both here [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3169.66s)]
*  and elsewhere. So I think it's important to recognize that fact, that there's a severe [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3174.22s)]
*  contradiction these campuses are facing, is that this mobilizing is not going to go away. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3181.74s)]
*  And the demands for divestment are not going to either go away either, right? So whatever comes [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3186.7799999999997s)]
*  next, there's a broader base now that has been mobilized. Now the question is, what do organizers [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3194.22s)]
*  do with that broader base or things to be worked out with, worked through at this moment, right? [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3199.9s)]
*  So I think, you know, some encouraging things, I know the speaker who was talking about California [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3206.46s)]
*  system, bringing more campuses into conversation with each other, having more kind of inter-campus [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3209.9s)]
*  solidarity and coordination is going to be very important. So I see, I think that's one thing. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3215.58s)]
*  I think another important thing to keep in mind is that the Palestinian student movement itself [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3221.58s)]
*  is reaching out to the student movement here, and you can see this growing kind of convergence [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3226.14s)]
*  on an international scale of resistance to the genocide. So I think where this will go next is, [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3231.58s)]
*  I believe the movement will continue to grow. I believe that people have lost fear, [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3237.66s)]
*  from repression, and once that fear is overcome and numbers grow and people really understand that [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3243.26s)]
*  an attack on one is an attack on all, you know, there's something very limiting in what the [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3247.5800000000004s)]
*  administrations could do now, right? I'll, you know, the resistance in the region in 1987 in Lebanon [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3252.94s)]
*  and elsewhere, they said, you know, the problem in the region is people have accepted a defeatism, [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3260.86s)]
*  and so it's a moment at which you believe that you can resist and win that a psychological change [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3265.0200000000004s)]
*  happens. And this is something I have not seen in my lifetime that we're truly seeing across campuses, [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3270.54s)]
*  is that there's a refusal to submit, because the equation that you find yourself in otherwise [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3274.7s)]
*  is that you're constantly begging the administration. You're constantly begging those who control power [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3279.1s)]
*  and control force to recognize you, to offer you rights. Can you, but what we're seeing now is [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3283.42s)]
*  the protesters and movements have raised up a counter force. It raised up a counter power that's [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3291.34s)]
*  going to move from begging and appealing to commending and, you know, reclaiming, again, [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3296.78s)]
*  the university as a space of a public university. So the Palestinians in remaining steadfast and [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3302.94s)]
*  resisting have opened up a space for students here to reclaim their own universities, and I think [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3308.54s)]
*  that's the direction ideally that will continue to move towards. Yeah, thank you so much for that. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3312.3s)]
*  And Sharif, yeah, I wanted to ask you about the ways in which you and your comrades on campuses saw [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3319.18s)]
*  the differences in the way that New York City Police Department repressed students at Columbia [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3327.9s)]
*  versus City College of New York, which was, you know, very, very close by, and also CUNY campuses. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3336.62s)]
*  You know, very, very close by and also CUNY campuses. Can you talk a little bit about that? [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3342.86s)]
*  So our understanding of it is that part of it has to do with the fact that Columbia is a [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3350.94s)]
*  quote-unquote Ivy League school and it has this prestige and that its students are, you know, [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3355.9s)]
*  locked up in the ivory tower. But materially, the difference has been that the students who [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3361.5s)]
*  were arrested at Columbia were given misdemeanor charges and students who were arrested at CUNY [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3366.46s)]
*  were given felony charges. And so off the bat, a very big difference in terms of how students [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3371.1s)]
*  are going to be dealing with the legal ramifications of them just speaking up for Palestine [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3376.7799999999997s)]
*  and opposing the genocide. And I think it's something that we're going to continue seeing [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3382.14s)]
*  because state schools do not necessarily protect their students in any way, shape, [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3387.1s)]
*  or form by way of their reputational value. They don't have that sort of unintentional [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3392.62s)]
*  defense of their own students, if that makes sense. Whereas at Columbia, it is a scandal. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3397.98s)]
*  Everything that's happening is a scandal because Columbia is undoing of its own reputation. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3404.3s)]
*  It's Columbia shaming itself and making it clear what Columbia actually is. It reveals who runs [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3408.7s)]
*  the university. It's the board of trustees, the donors. Whereas CUNY doesn't have that same system [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3414.78s)]
*  in place. It doesn't have these massively wealthy donors that are calling the shots in the same [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3420.7s)]
*  exact way. Although of course, they're likely our donors. It also doesn't have a university [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3425.5s)]
*  president that is prominently behaving like a fascist. And so these things are all embarrassing [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3431.58s)]
*  Columbia in a way. And I think a lot of the ways the NYPD, at least in a way that it messages [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3437.42s)]
*  things and the way that it charges things seems to be to handle it with care. But in terms of how [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3443.1s)]
*  they actually conducted the arrests, they were just as vile, just as violent. And both the sweeps [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3448.3s)]
*  of the encampments happened at the same night, during the same night. So both at CUNY and Columbia, [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3453.74s)]
*  police swept the building. They swept the encampment to Columbia and they immediately moved over to [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3459.02s)]
*  City College and swept it. I think a lot of that speaks to so much. But going back to your previous [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3464.4599999999996s)]
*  question about the future of how organizing is going to grow. When we think about the number of [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3471.1s)]
*  SJPs in America just two decades ago, it was about 10 or less. And then in a matter of 10 years, [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3478.94s)]
*  there were 200 to 250 chapters. And in the same way with the encampments, there was only one [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3486.62s)]
*  encampment or two, and then it became 34. And now there's over 120, I believe. So it's the same exact [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3492.86s)]
*  thing. The more they repress, the more other students pick up where we leave off and continue [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3499.82s)]
*  to work. And they keep pressuring their universities. And in a very clear way, it makes it [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3504.78s)]
*  impossible for universities to hold off the status quo, keep repressing in the way they think they [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3512.38s)]
*  can because they have no clear strategy. Their strategy is literally just to hit students where [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3518.0600000000004s)]
*  it hurts, to suspend them, to take away their dining hall access, to cut off their financial aid, [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3523.34s)]
*  to evict them from their dorms. And yet their strategy is not working. And it's clear that [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3529.5s)]
*  it's not working because every time an encampment is swept, another encampment replaces it either [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3535.5s)]
*  in the same day or the next day. And they have no strategy to prepare for this because the world is [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3540.78s)]
*  with Palestine. The world is against this genocide put together by the Zionist state. And the sentiment [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3545.98s)]
*  for Palestine now is so popular to the point that they cannot do anything any longer to hold their [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3551.42s)]
*  status quo together. Nora, you're muted. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3557.26s)]
*  It was my turn to be muted now. Thank you. Yeah, we just have a few minutes, but I just [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3565.6600000000003s)]
*  wanted to kind of get your, and a couple of our guests had to leave, but to get your thoughts on [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3573.9s)]
*  what happens next, where this goes, and really at the core, I mean, the [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3582.3799999999997s)]
*  corporate media is always saying this is a distraction. What the students are doing [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3593.98s)]
*  is a distraction from what's happening in Gaza as if they're covering what's happening in Gaza. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3599.5s)]
*  You know, it's just kind of extreme gaslighting. But what is at the core of these encampments [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3605.26s)]
*  is focusing on Palestine, is trying to help end this genocide. And the US is, primarily the US's [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3614.3s)]
*  complicity in enabling and co-authoring of this genocide. So yeah, just in the last few minutes, [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3623.1800000000003s)]
*  Bryce, let's start with you. Where do you see this movement going? And how are students, [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3631.02s)]
*  like yourself and your comrades, continuing to center Palestine right now? [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3636.2999999999997s)]
*  Right. Well, we always keep trying to say to the media and to the people around us, [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3642.3799999999997s)]
*  we're getting a lot of concern and outpouring of support from members of the community, [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3647.58s)]
*  faculty, and they're saying, oh, it is so horrible that we're seeing such levels of violence being [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3652.62s)]
*  used against our own students. We can't stand for this. Well, our line of the divesting coalition [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3658.22s)]
*  is that, well, if you're so concerned about this violence against these students here, [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3663.8999999999996s)]
*  you should be doubly concerned for the violence against the students in Gaza, for which you're [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3670.8599999999997s)]
*  directly responsible and for which you have the ability to intervene in. And so we turn to say, [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3675.66s)]
*  you know, all these arrests, all these, even the brutality of the police against students, [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3682.46s)]
*  all of it pales in comparison to what's being done in Gaza. It's nothing. You know, my five-year ban, [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3690.2200000000003s)]
*  imagine being banned from your home for 75 years. I mean, like that's what they're going through. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3697.02s)]
*  And so people are sympathetic to us, but I mean, they should be sympathetic to the goals, [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3702.2200000000003s)]
*  to the struggle that we're actually engaging in. And I keep telling people that if there is [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3707.66s)]
*  any positivity in the world, if there is going to be a just liberation for Palestine, it'll be [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3713.74s)]
*  because of the work that we're doing now. It'll be because of the networks that we're building, [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3720.14s)]
*  the organizations, the institutions that we're able to solidify, the connections that we're making [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3724.7799999999997s)]
*  with each other and with other places around the country or on the world. All of that work [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3729.8199999999997s)]
*  is what will shape the future of this movement and will shape the future of Palestine. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3734.94s)]
*  Every American should take that seriously. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3740.7799999999997s)]
*  Thanks, Bryce. Bikram? [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3746.22s)]
*  I mean, I think that's very well said. I think, you know, I would just encourage, [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3749.3399999999997s)]
*  and maybe speak to a lot of the students who have been arrested across campuses and are dealing [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3755.74s)]
*  with oppression, you know, that the objective of the university is to make people feel like [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3761.1800000000003s)]
*  individualized and isolated and separated from one another as they go through their specific cases, [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3766.38s)]
*  to feel more scared, to kind of, you know, retreat into your shelf, talk to your family, [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3772.78s)]
*  and try to protect yourself. But we can't forget exactly what Bryce was saying is our strength [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3776.7000000000003s)]
*  is in the deep solidarity and the numbers that are growing, right? The collective force and the [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3781.7400000000002s)]
*  growing of the movement is where the attention has to stay in relation to Palestine, right? [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3787.66s)]
*  In a similar way, if the Palestinian resistance is in all of society, resistance from doctors [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3791.74s)]
*  to the resistance fighters to journalists and, you know, everybody kind of standing together [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3796.94s)]
*  and not allowing a division, not allowing anybody to be singled out or targeted. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3802.8599999999997s)]
*  I think that really is the sentiment that has to be held onto is that we are stronger and they're [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3808.06s)]
*  afraid, right? They do this because they fear, I think what Sharif was saying, they fear that this [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3812.3799999999997s)]
*  movement is growing and it's clearly not going to be stoppable, right? I think that has to be the [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3816.78s)]
*  case that emphasizes that and this exposes them further. So if there are faculty on Bryce's campus [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3821.26s)]
*  or former campus or whatever who are saying these sorts of things, if something is being opened up [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3828.6200000000003s)]
*  for them, that they've been quiet for six months, but they're seeing now why, what is that stake [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3834.46s)]
*  that the administration would arrest their own students rather than speaking to them? Who actually [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3839.26s)]
*  controls this university? Why is the United States so invested in a genocide against the Palestinians [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3843.42s)]
*  and providing 2,000 pound bombs to an engaged population? Like what, these are all opening up [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3849.5s)]
*  these questions, right? And so we cannot shrink away from it. And really I want to give like a big [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3854.3s)]
*  salute and to Columbia, to Indiana and everywhere, because I know for us here, we get inspired by [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3859.58s)]
*  what's happening elsewhere. Our students get inspired, right? So as hard as it seems in these [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3866.06s)]
*  days, keep in mind the bigger picture that some people said, like there was 10 SGPs, look at the [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3870.3s)]
*  growth of this, right? It is growing stronger. The resistance in Palestine is holding out. They are [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3874.7000000000003s)]
*  on the back foot. They are weak. And so we need to continue to stay together, continue to organize, [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3880.46s)]
*  continue to build the movement, which I believe is going to happen. I don't think this is going [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3885.5800000000004s)]
*  to be repressed. It's growing across the world. So whether in Palestine and Yemen or Lebanon or here, [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3890.46s)]
*  I think the forces of resistance and solidarity will only deepen and grow. And that's where I see [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3897.1s)]
*  this going. Yeah. Beautiful. Thanks so much, Vikram. And finally, Sharif, where do you see this [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3902.2999999999997s)]
*  movement going? I think it's going to be more successful than any of these administrators [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3908.14s)]
*  can possibly imagine. I think it starts with a ceasefire. I think it starts with these [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3913.3399999999997s)]
*  administrators actually reckoning with the moment. Our students are full of will. We are full of hope. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3919.1s)]
*  We are full of creativity and imagination. And I think that's something that they can't control. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3926.06s)]
*  To think that an encampment could terrify a university when it's a peaceful gathering of [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3930.94s)]
*  hundreds of students and faculty and community coming together to share space and to screen [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3936.38s)]
*  films and to observe students canceling the university events and doing their events with us [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3940.7s)]
*  in the encampment. It's beautiful. It's something that can't be stopped because it's really love [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3945.98s)]
*  that's driving this. It's something that can't be described really unless you get to go and see it [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3951.02s)]
*  for yourself. Unless of course you go with preconceived notions of what it is that's happening [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3955.66s)]
*  there and you insist that it is something that it is now. And so in that way, a lot of students [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3960.62s)]
*  have reckoned with their own selves in the moment. It's so critical. And they said, [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3966.14s)]
*  we don't care about our degrees. We care about Palestine. And I think that's what's driving [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3970.46s)]
*  these universities nuts. They're so used to being able to pick us apart. They're so used to being [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3974.54s)]
*  able to say, hey, we'll give you a scholarship if you leave the camp. And that's not working. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3979.26s)]
*  And it's something that's really driving them up the wall. We're seeing it now. And for us at [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3984.6200000000003s)]
*  Columbia, it's something that's becoming crystal clear. When Manu Shafik lies in the entire campus [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3990.78s)]
*  community knows that it's a lie again and again. And we make her out to be who she is. And the [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=3997.1000000000004s)]
*  board of trustees now are becoming pretty famous in terms of their stocks and weapons companies [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=4003.1000000000004s)]
*  and surveillance companies. And it's something that can't be tenable forever. It's something [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=4007.58s)]
*  that is going to break. It's going to bust and we're going to be the ones to see it, I hope. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=4011.98s)]
*  And if not, it'll be seen very soon because Palestine will be free within our lifetimes [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=4018.06s)]
*  very clearly. It's not something that can be sustained. And I think it's something that makes [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=4022.7s)]
*  the Zionist state afraid. It makes politicians here afraid. It makes our university administrators [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=4026.62s)]
*  here afraid. And it's something that we take pride in. We take pride in being able to do this [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=4031.2599999999998s)]
*  because it's an opportunity and a privilege to be able to speak up for Palestine. Because Palestinians [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=4036.7s)]
*  are being killed left to right and it has not stopped yet. And so it's not just that. It's also [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=4040.7799999999997s)]
*  a duty. It's a duty to say ceasefire now. It's a duty to say divest now. It's a duty to say cops [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih9cLcI-L_Q&t=4045.4199999999996s)]
