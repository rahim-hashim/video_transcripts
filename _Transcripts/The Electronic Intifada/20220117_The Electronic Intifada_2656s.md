# How UK activists closed an Israeli arms factory for good with Adie Mormech & Max Geller | EI Podcast
**The Electronic Intifada:** [January 17, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8)
*  What it would be like when finally they say enough is enough, we're getting out of here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=0.0s)]
*  Elbit, Israel's largest weapons company is leaving. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=14.64s)]
*  So today was raucous, today we were on fire, everybody was going for it. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=17.44s)]
*  It was Elbit out of Oldham. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=21.76s)]
*  The electronic intifada. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=24.96s)]
*  The electronic intifada. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=25.96s)]
*  The electronic intifada. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=26.96s)]
*  This is the electronic intifada podcast. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=28.92s)]
*  I'm Nora Barrows-Freedman. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=31.92s)]
*  And I'm Asa Wyn Stanley. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=34.24s)]
*  And welcome back to the electronic intifada podcast. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=40.56s)]
*  I'm Nora Barrows-Freedman with my co-host Asa Wyn Stanley. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=42.8s)]
*  And we are delighted to be joined by two members of Palestine Action in the UK, Max Geller [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=46.96s)]
*  and Aidy Mourmesh. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=53.36s)]
*  Aidy, you're actually outside right now. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=55.199999999999996s)]
*  You just came back from a demonstration celebrating a significant victory for Palestine Action [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=58.72s)]
*  and for the Palestine Solidarity Movement as a whole. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=65.44s)]
*  Tell us where you are and what this victory celebration was all about. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=68.76s)]
*  Well, yeah, I'm actually still in Oldham, remarkably. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=75.48s)]
*  There's quite a lot of people have gone home by now, but we stayed around. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=78.36s)]
*  There was a lot of the community came out today. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=81.92s)]
*  Everybody was just absolutely over the moon. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  I had a young woman that was up to me today and she said she just started crying straight away. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=87.72s)]
*  She'd been a lot to the demonstrations. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=92.16s)]
*  But I think for a lot of the people there, I don't think they know how it feels to actually [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=94.44s)]
*  gain a big victory because this is a hard fought campaign. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=99.16s)]
*  It was the last year, especially where the last two years, probably where things really upped [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=104.16s)]
*  and we upped the ante and there was a lot more activity, a lot more action, a lot more [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=109.08s)]
*  mobilization as a result from the community as well. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=113.8s)]
*  And it was nonstop. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=117.39999999999999s)]
*  And of course, with the brilliant direct action from Palestine Action, the actions that really [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  woke a lot of people up and really raised the game for everybody and everything that we were doing [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=125.24s)]
*  about this weapons factory here in Oldham, which is in the northwest of England, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=129.8s)]
*  and one of the only one in the north, actually. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=133.48s)]
*  And it was just a massive blot on the landscape for a huge part of the community. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=135.76s)]
*  But no one really saw or imagined the exact feeling of what it would be like when finally [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=140.76s)]
*  they say enough is enough. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=146.2s)]
*  We're getting out of here. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=147.68s)]
*  Albeit Israel's largest weapons company is leaving. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=148.88s)]
*  So today was raucous. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=151.6s)]
*  Today we were on fire. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=152.96s)]
*  Everybody was going for it. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=154.64s)]
*  It was a bit out of old and and just just the incredible feeling for people that you can [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=156.0s)]
*  achieve massive things against huge big businesses with huge resources, very, very, you know, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=162.32s)]
*  operating on such a high level of actually brutality and how to confront that as a local [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=168.52s)]
*  community with some help from the less than the Northwest. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=175.48000000000002s)]
*  It was stunning today. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=178.92000000000002s)]
*  Absolutely wonderful. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=180.20000000000002s)]
*  There's some great, great scenes on video as well. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=181.08s)]
*  The people in South Africa who fought and won against apartheid when nobody knew that [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=198.52s)]
*  victory was just around the corner. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=205.8s)]
*  And what have we just done now? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=207.8s)]
*  We have mobilized. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=209.8s)]
*  We have got everybody out. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=211.8s)]
*  And yes, we have direct action. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=213.8s)]
*  Yes, they smashed those weapons up. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=219.8s)]
*  Those weapons are killing people on the other side of the world and they are being sold to [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=221.8s)]
*  other awful regimes. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=226.60000000000002s)]
*  We have to stop all of these weapons being built. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=228.12s)]
*  We have to stop the profits that are going to warrant these corrupt companies that are [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=231.16s)]
*  basing their industry on murder and death. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=236.12s)]
*  And we won't stop until that ends. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=239.88s)]
*  And we won't stop until Palestine is free. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=242.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=245.96s)]
*  Tell us, you know, for our listeners who may not be aware, Max, take us to what happened [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=252.20000000000002s)]
*  in Oldham, why it's significant and what activists did to achieve this kind of victory [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=259.8s)]
*  against Elbit Systems, one of Israel's largest weapons manufacturers. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=270.68s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, there's a great article on EI by Asa actually about this, which I encourage [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=274.52s)]
*  everyone to check out for background. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=281.96s)]
*  But yesterday, after, as Adi said, years of campaigning, years of vigorous direct action [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=284.76s)]
*  campaigns, yesterday, Elbit sold its interests in Oldham. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=294.03999999999996s)]
*  They sold off its interests in the United States. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=300.76s)]
*  They sold off its factory and have permanently quit Oldham, shuttering its factory, selling [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=304.03999999999996s)]
*  off its assets at a big loss, by the way. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=313.08s)]
*  You know, they bought this factory for six million pounds more than they sold it. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=316.2s)]
*  So, right. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=322.91999999999996s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=323.96s)]
*  I had known that. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=325.0s)]
*  I should have included that in my article. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=325.71999999999997s)]
*  That's really significant. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=327.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, so we're just over the moon at having, you know, a real great result to prove to [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=329.88000000000005s)]
*  ourselves and the world that our tactics are working. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=338.76000000000005s)]
*  We have, there's nine more facilities in the UK that Elbit owns and operates that we are [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=342.12s)]
*  now still campaigning against, and we're not going to stop until we get rid of all of them. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=350.20000000000005s)]
*  And yesterday was just the first sort of concrete instance of it working. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=357.0s)]
*  Elbit has decided that the price tag is just too high. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=368.12s)]
*  The cost of business, knowing that every few weeks, activists are going to prevent workers [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=373.16s)]
*  from carrying out work and that literally every week, the community will come out and [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=379.32s)]
*  shut down the roads around the factory demanding that this factory close. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=386.2s)]
*  Eventually, Elbit just said, you know, that they threw up their hands and they sold it. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=391.0s)]
*  They sold the factory. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=394.84000000000003s)]
*  They said, we can't do this anymore. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=395.8s)]
*  And to me, it's the most exciting BDS victory that's taken place for years. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=397.8s)]
*  And I'm very excited and I'm excited about what's going to come next. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=406.12s)]
*  Well, 80, give us a sense of you mentioned a little bit people, you know, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=411.4s)]
*  celebrating this victory and how significant it was and it is for them. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=417.08s)]
*  Can you give us a sense of the kind of spirit that activists there in Oldham are galvanizing [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=422.92s)]
*  in terms of like, okay, one down, nine to go. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=434.44s)]
*  Talk about the movement right now and where this is going. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=437.0s)]
*  Well, it's just clear that this is what it takes. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=444.52000000000004s)]
*  This is the formula for winning. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=447.88s)]
*  You have to make the price too high, as Max said, because they're not going to wander out easily. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=450.52000000000004s)]
*  We've had, you know, we've been doing this campaign for five years and we had the stalls. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=456.68s)]
*  We were doing the demonstrations out the front. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=461.56s)]
*  We were obviously spreading awareness around the community and the city and Oldham itself. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=464.76s)]
*  And a lot of us are coming in from Manchester at the beginning. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=469.56s)]
*  But now, after a while of that, more and more people started getting involved in Oldham. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=472.59999999999997s)]
*  You know, there was a little bit of movement on a political level. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=477.24s)]
*  There was a lot of work done on that level, but not much was happening. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=479.64s)]
*  So there was time for upping the ante. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=483.48s)]
*  And we've got a history of direct action in Manchester, the suffragettes and many other, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=486.84s)]
*  you know, militant trade union movements and workers movements and anti-arms movements. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=491.72s)]
*  Historically, they are the sharp edge of how to get things done. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=495.72s)]
*  And obviously it worked especially well at Oldham because we had a lot of other work going on [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=499.64000000000004s)]
*  and groups that complemented each other and respected each other. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=504.44000000000005s)]
*  We had about 10 different groups there that we've worked together with really well from all over the [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=507.24s)]
*  northwest today. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=511.56s)]
*  Even they all turned up for the celebration. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=512.76s)]
*  But ultimately, over a long period, there was people coming from Liverpool, from Sheffield, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=514.44s)]
*  from Halifax, all over the different parts of the north that have contributed massively to these [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=518.36s)]
*  actions. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=525.08s)]
*  And we've always had a host of people supporting those taking the direct action outside for [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=525.72s)]
*  support at the police stations, court support. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=530.84s)]
*  And of course, crowds outside blocking the road every week, 31 weeks since May, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=533.5600000000001s)]
*  people from the community. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=539.0s)]
*  And of course, what are we doing there? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=540.28s)]
*  We're also educating while we're there. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=541.72s)]
*  We're talking about Elbit. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=543.16s)]
*  We're talking about Israel's arms. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=544.44s)]
*  We're talking about the situation in Palestine. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=545.8000000000001s)]
*  I was in Gaza for two years. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=547.96s)]
*  So my students were killed by these weapons. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=549.24s)]
*  And this was a direct connect for me and many others have been to Palestine who were there and [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=553.5600000000001s)]
*  were transmitting exactly what these weapons are doing because my line is always the same. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=558.84s)]
*  I was in Elsheif Hospital during the bombing in 2012 as the bodies were being brought in, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=563.48s)]
*  as the injured were being brought in. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=569.5600000000001s)]
*  I was in the intensive care units as little two-year-old Haneen was being rolled around [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=571.0s)]
*  gray and lifeless while her parents outside still had hope. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=575.16s)]
*  And we knew she'd gone with the brain hemorrhage. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=578.12s)]
*  This was real. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=580.36s)]
*  This is the connect. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=581.0s)]
*  And so my feeling was you treat these weapons companies like you're running out of Elsheif [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=581.88s)]
*  Hospital in Gaza, like you're right in the middle of it all. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=586.36s)]
*  Because if we are really all Palestinian, you need to take the appropriate action to show it. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=589.3199999999999s)]
*  And if you can't take that action, there's a million different support jobs to do and [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=593.56s)]
*  there's a million different actions to do to support the community. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=596.8399999999999s)]
*  So where are we at now? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=600.1999999999999s)]
*  We have got a green light to replicate because that's a lot of what we were doing. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=601.24s)]
*  We were up and replicating the Raytheon victory in Ireland in 2006. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=604.92s)]
*  And we brought in Colin Bryce, one of those activists and the others, who smashed all that [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=608.92s)]
*  factory, which galvanized the local population, who got mobilized and won and forced Raytheon [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=614.4399999999999s)]
*  out of Derry. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=619.56s)]
*  It's not difficult. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=620.28s)]
*  It does take a lot of work and it takes a bit of guts. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=621.8s)]
*  And it also takes a lot of sustainability to keep things going. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=624.28s)]
*  But it shows that it can be done. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=628.1999999999999s)]
*  And if it can be done, and Palestinians, when they are in the marches, I was in there on [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=629.7199999999999s)]
*  the demonstrations in Gaza, when they're walking towards the borders, they get shot and killed. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=633.16s)]
*  One of them did right next to me when we had similar kinds of demonstrations in 2010, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=637.3199999999999s)]
*  like the Great Return March, the Gaza Freedom March. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=642.36s)]
*  And so this is the reality when they demonstrate. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=645.24s)]
*  So the cost for us is less. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=649.0s)]
*  It's not easy. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=651.7199999999999s)]
*  And I'm not saying it's a walk in the park, but it is less and the effect can be huge. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=652.6s)]
*  And just look at the results here at the Albert Franti factory to prove it and look at the [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=657.16s)]
*  scenes on the streets today and the young people, especially that have come out a lot, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=662.6s)]
*  who now believe that they are not just observers, they are active agents who can do something about [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=666.6s)]
*  this horrible arms industry and Israel's complicit companies here in England. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=671.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, what I found really quite amusing yesterday. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=677.16s)]
*  Yesterday when I wrote my article, it was definitely the day of schadenfreude. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=683.32s)]
*  And it was great to see this factory, Albert pulling out of this factory. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=687.64s)]
*  I just found it quite funny, the press releases they put out, because of course, you know, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=694.2s)]
*  it's my job to read these things. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=698.92s)]
*  And the kind of corporate speak, the desperate spin they were putting on it as well was quite great. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=701.0s)]
*  It was really obvious as well. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=708.28s)]
*  It wasn't even that well hidden. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=709.56s)]
*  I thought they'd be cleverer by now. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=710.92s)]
*  Yeah, they said the cell was a quote reorganisation, which would help them [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=713.08s)]
*  quote focus activities on certain areas. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=719.08s)]
*  And they were quote consolidating their market position. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=722.92s)]
*  So, you know, great. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=727.96s)]
*  Long may they refocus their activities. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=732.2s)]
*  And after that, I wasn't surprised that their share price started plummeting after that. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=734.84s)]
*  Again, this was something that I hadn't thought to check, actually. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=739.96s)]
*  I only saw it on the Palestine Action Twitter afterwards. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=742.9200000000001s)]
*  I mean, fantastic. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=746.0400000000001s)]
*  This is the only thing these companies understand is to hit them in the bottom line. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=748.5200000000001s)]
*  And that's what Palestine Action has done. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=751.96s)]
*  We've taken over 70 actions in the last 12 months against Albert in the UK. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=755.48s)]
*  70 actions in which Palestine actionists have taken arrest. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=762.44s)]
*  And we've cost Albert tens of millions of pounds in doing this, costing them days at work, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=767.0799999999999s)]
*  the cost of not doing business. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=775.24s)]
*  One connection I think is really, really important to make is that this announcement comes one month [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=779.3199999999999s)]
*  after the acquittal of three Palestine actionists for shutting down a factory elsewhere in the UK. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=785.8s)]
*  It's clear that if the UK is not going to prosecute Palestine action, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=795.4s)]
*  Albert is going to be left with very little options besides quitting the country. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=801.4s)]
*  I think what Adi said about Raytheon in the north of Ireland is really important. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=807.56s)]
*  It's really important to understand that there is precedent for these tactics working. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=817.56s)]
*  Activists took on Raytheon in Derry and they didn't stop until there was a court case. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=822.84s)]
*  And when that court case went the activist way, Raytheon said, well, this isn't worth it. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=830.44s)]
*  And so they left and delivering us the blueprint for the victory, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=835.32s)]
*  the first step in the victory that we're experiencing today. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=840.36s)]
*  And we're not going to stop until we've replicated that success. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=843.8000000000001s)]
*  I really think it's a testament to a more militant version of BDS that we're seeing in the UK that I [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=848.52s)]
*  think we could see elsewhere with a similar success. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=857.8s)]
*  And I think it's really important to examine Palestinian actions tactics here because [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=863.0s)]
*  we're an organization that really sort of acknowledges and embraces the cost that doing [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=872.12s)]
*  BDS work like this comes with. A lot of people will tell you that there is no cost or that if [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=877.72s)]
*  you just tailor your campaign just so you won't experience any backlash. But for us, it's well [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=884.2s)]
*  worth it. It's well worth spending a night in jail to enjoy the celebrations on the street when you [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=895.0s)]
*  actually shut down a factory and win. We talked with Huda and Richard before in [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=899.08s)]
*  one of our previous podcasts about the tactics here and what direct action really means when [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=905.0s)]
*  we talk about the BDS. And I think that's a really important point that we're seeing in the [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=914.12s)]
*  US. And Max, I know you're very familiar with this. A lot of the campaigns are kind of like [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=921.1600000000001s)]
*  a wide umbrella. There's a lot of petitions. There's a lot of appealing to the moral character of [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=928.12s)]
*  elected representatives. And that sometimes we get, you know, I think it's a little bit of a [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=935.32s)]
*  question. And sometimes we get a nominal victory now and then. But what is the difference between [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=945.48s)]
*  that kind of campaigning and the kind of campaigning where members of Palestine Action [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=960.36s)]
*  are literally putting their bodies on the line and on top of the roofs of these weapons factories? [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=968.2s)]
*  Why do you think it's so important and really makes a difference here? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=976.84s)]
*  Well, direct action has always made a huge difference because you are actually changing [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=985.24s)]
*  what's happening directly. I mean, it's an obvious point, but you're going so indirectly. And at [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=990.84s)]
*  times, you know, it's like almost controlled resistance. They allow in Western democracies, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=997.48s)]
*  they want to give you the pretense that you have democratic avenues towards making change. And of [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1003.96s)]
*  course, we've been sitting here watching Israel increase its weapon sales by hundreds of million [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1008.36s)]
*  a pound. The more they killed in Gaza, they killed 2,200 people, 500 children, 51 days, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1013.24s)]
*  and then their weapon sales goes up 200 million up in from the UK. It was after 2014 bombings. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1019.0s)]
*  So if they're developing their weapons on Palestinians, their stock goes up. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1026.76s)]
*  It is about up in the ante because we were under the pretense that actually our meetings with the [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1031.3999999999999s)]
*  politicians and then politicians were having an impact and they weren't close and it needed that [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1035.32s)]
*  boost. And actually, prior to Palestine Action, there was like a precursor in Manchester, which [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1040.76s)]
*  is Manchester Palestine Action, which is still going and I'm still involved with. And we were [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1045.56s)]
*  doing direct action then and I was doing quite a lot of it, in part because I knew that it was [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1049.32s)]
*  vital for winning campaigns in the past and I'd seen race, I knew all about race, but I'd known [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1053.8s)]
*  about activists tearing up the cricket pitches in England to stop the South African apartheid regime [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1058.44s)]
*  from playing here while they didn't allow black players. Obviously, you know, in Manchester, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1064.6s)]
*  we have the suffragettes and there's a long history of smashing things up so far as they were about [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1069.08s)]
*  making actual an imprint on the business as usual. And you talk about people were today, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1074.04s)]
*  there was a South African who's often coming and we talked about Desmond Tutu and about, you know, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1079.8s)]
*  you can't be neutral in times of oppression and there's no business as usual. And this is the [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1085.08s)]
*  whole point. There can't be any business as usual. And the level of atrocity, Britain, this tiny [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1090.6s)]
*  island here is still one of the largest exporters of weapons in the world. I mean, you think of the [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1096.9199999999998s)]
*  horrific weapons happening that are being used on so many populations around the world. And I saw it [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1101.8s)]
*  up close in Gaza when I was there during the bombing. And you know that the level of action [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1107.4s)]
*  has to be higher than what's happening now because we it's too easy to just normalize the ritual of [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1111.88s)]
*  going around in a circle on a demonstration or doing a talk and pretending that's changing something. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1118.0400000000002s)]
*  You know, most of the time with Palestine, for me, if you've read a couple of books and had a couple [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1124.44s)]
*  of talks, it's not that difficult. You're almost there and then it's about changing things. And [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1128.2800000000002s)]
*  that's the only way having read about history, changes happened is when people stepped up and [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1132.6s)]
*  put themselves in the way a lot of the times. And it's not, it's no, you know, it's no secret that in, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1138.28s)]
*  for example, the civil rights movement in America, a lot of those big moments with people [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1143.08s)]
*  breaking through what was a boundary, either a legal boundary or a boundary of what was done [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1146.84s)]
*  at that time and having the courage to do so. And it has a massive impact. Needless to say, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1153.08s)]
*  on the media point of view, you know, we only ever got media at all when there was a big direct [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1159.1599999999999s)]
*  action. Why? Because actually there is a spark to that. There's a spark that says this human being [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1165.08s)]
*  is doing something out of the ordinary for a particular cause. There must be something there. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1170.76s)]
*  And that's real. That's a, there's a logic there. It is. And of course, added to that, as Max said, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1175.08s)]
*  there is a value of, that is taken away from that company. There is an, that company is a less [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1180.12s)]
*  effective arms company when those actions are taking place. And so for everyone, we don't know, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1186.84s)]
*  we can't, a lot of this is untangible, which what's making it so difficult, which what makes today so [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1192.6799999999998s)]
*  incredible for us, because this is very tangible. But at the rest of the time, we know that that's [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1197.1599999999999s)]
*  having an impact on that company. We know their stock, you know, is, they're worried about their [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1202.12s)]
*  stock market value. And so ultimately we know we're going to get there in the end, but actually, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1206.36s)]
*  you know, it's, it's clear from history, the direct action has always had an effect and it's clear [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1211.8s)]
*  that this has had a major imprint. Palestine action, everybody was saying it, all the locals, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1216.52s)]
*  the local groups, whether it's Unite for Palestine, Olden Peace and Justice, Manchester, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1221.16s)]
*  all the Manchester groups, Manchester PSC even, and all the others were saying Palestine actions [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1225.8799999999999s)]
*  effect on this particular campaign has been the most important because it upped the ante like [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1230.92s)]
*  nothing before. And it got a lot of locals doing a lot more who were inspired by it. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1236.92s)]
*  Actually, as well as that, what was most important is we maintained the narrative about Palestine, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1242.1200000000001s)]
*  and we brought it back to the Palestinians. And of course, me, I was in Gaza for two years, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1247.88s)]
*  my message box is full from my friends and my ex-students in Gaza, many of whom had lost so many [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1253.16s)]
*  people, and they are over the moon. So if you're having a direct impact like that, it is worth it. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1258.52s)]
*  Believe me, it's worth it. Yeah, I think what was really great to see this past spring, summer, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1264.44s)]
*  and during the latest Israeli war against the civilian population in Palestine as a whole, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1272.3600000000001s)]
*  really, but especially in the Gaza Strip was, you know, the kind of [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1280.5200000000002s)]
*  spark of light in was the Palestine action, actions in the UK against Elbit factories and how [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1287.3200000000002s)]
*  it people were coming out, as you've been describing from the local community, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1296.1200000000001s)]
*  spontaneously, you know, or semi spontaneously, you know, the groundwork have been laid for so long. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1300.84s)]
*  And people just coming out and you're having these real groups of people coming and [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1306.84s)]
*  supporting you, not necessarily like scaling the rooftop, but like supporting people who were doing [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1310.6s)]
*  so. And, you know, just this big upsurge in support is really great to see. And it's clearly having [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1315.48s)]
*  a big difference. I think it's important to emphasise as well that like, you know, while I [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1324.36s)]
*  suppose the cut, there's all different roles within what you've been doing. So maybe necessarily [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1331.4799999999998s)]
*  the sabotage of like smashing windows and scaling the factories that you've been doing. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1339.3999999999999s)]
*  It might not necessarily be for everyone. But I think it's important to say there's these [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1345.7199999999998s)]
*  different roles and also that you're not just like going in mindlessly smashing things up, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1350.44s)]
*  that there is an actual legal strategy in place here, you know, which is supported by lawyers. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1357.64s)]
*  And as Max said earlier, you know, you've done so many of these actions over the last [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1362.6000000000001s)]
*  18 months since the launch of Palestine action. And, you know, as you mentioned as well, even [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1369.3200000000002s)]
*  before that, there was other precursor direct action groups and so forth. You've done so many [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1374.44s)]
*  of these actions, even, you know, going so far as to smash windows and to deface Elbit's property. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1381.0800000000002s)]
*  But not a single person has been successfully prosecuted for any of this, for any, you know, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1389.48s)]
*  so-called criminal damage and so forth. And now, as Max mentioned, in December, we have this legal [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1394.28s)]
*  precedent, you could say, of three Palestine action activists who defaced one of Elbit's [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1399.32s)]
*  factories in Shenstone, I believe it was, near Birmingham, right? They were all acquitted, [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1409.24s)]
*  found not guilty of criminal damage by a jury. And the reason being is because of the legal argument [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1416.76s)]
*  that was made by your lawyers, which you've been making all along, which is that, yes, you know, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1425.0s)]
*  we're not trying to pretend we didn't do anything. Yes, we damaged these factories, but it's not [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1429.32s)]
*  criminal damage because we are acting proportionately to prevent war crimes in Palestine by the Israeli [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1433.72s)]
*  occupation authorities. And actually, it's quite a similar legal strategy to what was just done in [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1442.68s)]
*  Bristol with the Colston Four, who, you know, through this statue of a slave owner, mass murderer, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1448.04s)]
*  Robert Colston, into the Bristol docks, you know, they made us in some way similar arguments saying [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1457.8s)]
*  that the presence of this statue was actually a hate crime against the multicultural population [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1464.04s)]
*  of Bristol. And so therefore, although, yes, we damaged the statue, it was proportionate action [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1472.04s)]
*  to prevent a greater crime. So, you know, we're seeing a really good, really, so many good [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1478.04s)]
*  precedents being set here. And it can work. This is the main message, I think, to me. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1482.84s)]
*  Totally. I just, the thing I'm most proud of is just how the extent to which Palestine action [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1489.08s)]
*  continues to show up. These aren't one-offs, right? These aren't single things that just happen one [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1497.6399999999999s)]
*  time. We show up at these factories and then we come back and we promise everybody that we will [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1506.76s)]
*  continue to come back until these factories are gone. Sit-ins at lunch counters in the U.S. would [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1512.6s)]
*  never have made a difference if they were just one-offs. Those people came and kept coming back [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1519.8s)]
*  every day, getting arrested week in and week out until the dilemma that they caused, those business [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1525.16s)]
*  owners, was too great. And that's what we're trying to do. We're trying to, unlike some of the [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1533.3200000000002s)]
*  non-BDS supporting direct action that we've seen in the U.S., which are just one-offs, I mean, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1540.28s)]
*  it's great to protest outside APAC, but these are, like, if not now is going to be a serious [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1546.1200000000001s)]
*  direct action group, they have to show up and keep showing up. And one thing that Palestine Action is [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1553.0s)]
*  very proud of is that we are proud supporters of the BDS movement and we understand our work as part [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1560.84s)]
*  of this BDS movement against the Israeli arms trade, but we are not doing flash mobs and signing [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1568.6s)]
*  petitions. We are putting ourselves directly against the sort of pointy end of state power here. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1576.76s)]
*  We've had activists have their houses searched, we've had activists arrested, like myself, we've had, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1585.8s)]
*  you know, like, passports seized, but these are, this isn't just using our privilege, this is like [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1597.0s)]
*  building an actual coalition to put ourselves in between the state and Palestine, which is a [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1605.24s)]
*  very tense and intense place to be, but it's effective. And I think, you know, I appreciate [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1616.2s)]
*  and I understand very well the differences between UK law and U.S. law. I mean, I think a lot of our [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1626.28s)]
*  American friends listening to this would just be like, well, if we got on the rooftops of an [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1633.88s)]
*  American factory, they would just fire host us directly into a paddy wagon and that would be that. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1638.8400000000001s)]
*  And I think that's true and I think it's important to understand that there are differences in the [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1645.48s)]
*  countries we all live in, in the context we're all in, but I also think it's really important to sort [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1650.3600000000001s)]
*  of understand where the pro-Palestine NGOs are at with this kind of tactic. Why don't the bigger [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1656.52s)]
*  NGOs in the states have a bail fund for BDS activists who are willing to take arrest? Why [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1666.6s)]
*  is that not more worthwhile than, say, spending a lot of money lobbying Congress for victories that [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1673.56s)]
*  are only as deep as Jamal Bowman's character, you know, which is for politicians to admit that [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1682.68s)]
*  perhaps Palestinians may possibly be human? And that's the crimes we're looking for. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1690.2s)]
*  These are important questions that people doing this work need to be asking themselves and [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1696.52s)]
*  conversations we as a movement need to be having, which is priorities, because we could be prioritizing [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1702.1200000000001s)]
*  direct arrestable action in the states with bail funds and other tactics. We're just not doing that. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1709.0s)]
*  And I think it's worth exploring because in the UK it is working and we are seeing incredible [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1717.88s)]
*  successes, more impressive than any of the ones I've ever been a part of in the states, because [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1726.68s)]
*  we're caught, like this is the sort of, you know, as we all know, weapons are the primary export of [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1733.3999999999999s)]
*  the Israeli economy. This is hitting Israel and Western Empire in general where it really hurts. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1741.0s)]
*  And it's important to understand who our enemies are and where their power comes from and [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1750.28s)]
*  plan our targets accordingly. Yeah, so what's the... Just on the court case very briefly, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1758.2s)]
*  I just wanted to add it was actually the magistrates court that the three, because I was there and the [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1763.96s)]
*  three activists got off and it was actually a judge. Now, you're right, sorry, yes, I stand corrected. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1768.76s)]
*  Yeah, no, not at all. It's an interesting point because that's even bigger. To convince a judge, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1776.2800000000002s)]
*  it's easier to convince a jury because in the Colson statute that was a jury. Right. And [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1781.16s)]
*  you are bringing in real human things that many people on the ground know about. And the same here, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1787.24s)]
*  it was actually the judge that responded to the narratives, the excellent narratives of the [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1795.48s)]
*  defendants about the connections as to where these weapons were going, as to what does justify [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1800.52s)]
*  an appropriate reaction to the making of those weapons, when those weapons are clearly being, [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1806.6000000000001s)]
*  A, developed, tested on a population in Gaza that's mostly children and, B, being sold [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1811.8s)]
*  abroad or used by Israel itself to decimate that population further. So this argument is there to [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1818.84s)]
*  be made. They have excellent lawyers and this is also in part because it's the lawyers, the legal [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1828.52s)]
*  case, which is so crucial here because we've seen again and again, like you say about Albert, I mean, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1834.84s)]
*  before we, you know, these actions really raised the game in the last year, our regular actions, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1839.64s)]
*  direct action on Albert, we would get off all the time. You know, the one that I was on the roof of [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1846.44s)]
*  this Albert arms factory in Oldham about two years ago. And when not only did we come down, [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1853.24s)]
*  we were on the roof for three days, we shut it for two days and then obviously we're arrested [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1861.24s)]
*  and we're there in the cell and then we go, we get let out and it says no further action. I mean, [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1865.88s)]
*  normally we get a court case and we start building up towards it, then they drop it and actually it's [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1872.7600000000002s)]
*  the Crown Prosecution Service that usually gets tired of not getting what they want from Albert [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1877.4s)]
*  because we come with a big shopping list wanting to know exactly what Albert is making, what they're [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1881.8000000000002s)]
*  doing and the weapons licenses, who they're selling to. That's what we need. That's our [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1886.1200000000001s)]
*  defense because it is about stopping a greater crime and it is about what it is that they're [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1891.24s)]
*  doing. And so, you know, not only did I get let out with no further action, but the Monday I [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1896.04s)]
*  went into the police station and talked on my climbing equipment back. That's the extent to [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1901.0s)]
*  which Albert was willing to be hands off. So obviously they've got something to hide. I think [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1907.0s)]
*  absolutely. There's never been such a just, you know, this onslaught to expose what Arms Factory [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1911.64s)]
*  is doing has never happened before and so they've been really quite, you know, happy and complacent [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1921.8000000000002s)]
*  and undercover. A bit like the Conservative Party doing all these, you know, Christmas jollies during [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1927.8000000000002s)]
*  Covid. You know, they're that untouchable or they think they're that untouchable that they've [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1934.1200000000001s)]
*  probably been getting away with all kinds of things, even on top of just their trade they're [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1938.12s)]
*  in, which is a toxic industry. So this is why they've been running scared. And of course, [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1942.1999999999998s)]
*  I think Palestine Action is an incredible job at seeing that. Seeing that weakness about specifically [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1947.0s)]
*  arms companies, especially Israel's worst arms company, when Israel itself is finally being [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1952.12s)]
*  exposed to the apartheid state that anyone has been there can see it clearly is. So I think there's a [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1957.1599999999999s)]
*  lot of different tactical aspects of this which are very clever from Palestine Action to understand [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1963.24s)]
*  the current geopolitics of what Israel is in the world, to understand the current movement on the [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1968.84s)]
*  ground, because there is a lot of people that have joined this movement that, believe me, had no place [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1974.52s)]
*  in the usual organizations that were doing things on Palestine. They are mostly new people that have [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1979.4s)]
*  come forward that were not doing anything on Palestine and didn't have an in. Why? Because [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1986.52s)]
*  they wanted this direct action route. They wanted to do something that was going to be for them much [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1990.44s)]
*  more impactful on an immediate level. And of course, a lot of those are young people. And [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=1995.0800000000002s)]
*  we all know that a lot of our organizations are not incorporating enough young people. And of course, [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2002.28s)]
*  that was where the energy was in May for the masses around the world. And you can see that [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2006.8400000000001s)]
*  they're championing the bit. And again, like you say, of course, it doesn't have to be the most [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2011.3200000000002s)]
*  sharp end of direct action. But even our demonstrations outside the front of Elbit in [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2016.6799999999998s)]
*  Oldham, we were closing the road down every time. So we were taking that extra step and pushing a [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2022.76s)]
*  bit harder. And of course, that complemented superbly the very courageous activists that got on the roof [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2027.7199999999998s)]
*  and got inside the factories. And that is the one that caused so much trouble. Because when I was on [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2032.6s)]
*  the roof a couple of years ago, we were on the roof and we were happy that we'd shut it down. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2037.48s)]
*  But in fact, probably the bosses were sitting around the table going, well, at least nothing's [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2041.3999999999999s)]
*  been damaged. So of course, you know, if you put yourself in their shoes and then think to yourself, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2045.56s)]
*  what do they not want us to do? Whenever I'm not sure what I should be doing about, you know, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2049.48s)]
*  trying to work hard to stop complicit companies in the UK or doing stuff to support Palestinians, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2055.08s)]
*  I ask myself, what does Israel not want us to do? What does Israeli arms companies not want us to [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2059.88s)]
*  do? We want to make it as hard for them as possible because what they're doing is obscene. And anyone [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2064.84s)]
*  that's been in those hospitals has seen it up close. Anyone that's been in Gaza during the [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2068.92s)]
*  bombing or even just during the aftermath has seen it up close. And they will be [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2072.52s)]
*  chomping at the bit to say, right, okay, it's time to act now. I'm not having them go through that [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2076.68s)]
*  again. And so really, it is about upping it. It's about sticking your chest out and going for it [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2081.48s)]
*  because it's the very, very least that Palestinians deserve. It's beautifully said. So, okay, so I mean, [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2086.36s)]
*  today is a day of victory and hope. And, you know, hopefully these kind of victories can keep going [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2095.08s)]
*  throughout the year. But what is the backlash? Like, what's the potential backlash? [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2101.72s)]
*  What I mean by that is, for example, yeah, and you're absolutely right to point out that this was, [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2109.48s)]
*  contrary to what I said earlier, it wasn't a jury, it was a magistrate. So it was just a judge [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2116.52s)]
*  making this. So it's even better in a way. But the conservative government, in response to [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2122.2799999999997s)]
*  the Colston Four case that I mentioned earlier, I'm now making rumblings about potentially changing [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2130.28s)]
*  the law in some ways to save our statues of all these remaining racists that we have up in the [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2138.2000000000003s)]
*  up in this country being honoured. So, you know, and of course, we've seen the conservative [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2146.04s)]
*  government for years now has been saying they're gonna ban BDS, which personally, I think is [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2152.84s)]
*  impossible. And, you know, they keep saying they're going to do it, and then they don't really do it. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2158.92s)]
*  Nonetheless, you know, you as Palestine Action have had a lot of oppression against you, like [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2164.6s)]
*  you've been threatened with all sorts of things, including even vague threats about, you know, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2171.16s)]
*  using increasing so called anti terrorism law measures against you. So, you know, what, what are [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2176.84s)]
*  the potential backlash could you face now? And what what concerns do you have sort of going forward, I suppose? [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2185.32s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think it's important to recognise that from the, you know, the US context, the [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2197.32s)]
*  Midwest 13, the Rasmus O'Day case, etc. Palestine activists are always sort of [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2206.2000000000003s)]
*  facing that state repression. They don't need to change the law in order to target Palestine [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2213.48s)]
*  and Palestine activists, whether they're in the US or the UK. And so I mean, like the Holy Land Five [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2220.44s)]
*  is another great example, right? Like, they will use anti terrorism laws against Palestine whenever [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2229.96s)]
*  they can. And, you know, I mean, we've had anti terrorism police in the UK, see the passports of [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2235.96s)]
*  Palestine action is the this these forms of state repression are nothing new, and nothing we're not [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2246.36s)]
*  sort of prepared for. It's part of our strategy to create these dilemmas for, [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2255.88s)]
*  you know, the British government, are you really, you know, in the last [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2265.08s)]
*  year, we've had hundreds of people arrested doing Palestine action, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2270.44s)]
*  actions, some people have been arrested multiple times, are they really going to [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2275.96s)]
*  try and put us all in jail for 10 years? That's, we don't believe that there's a the political will [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2280.76s)]
*  in this country to do that. And so that's not a fear tactic that we're really going to respond to. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2289.0800000000004s)]
*  We've had an unbelievable outpouring in the last week, since the magistrate cleared those three [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2297.7200000000003s)]
*  brave actionists, people who said, Oh, well, if they can get off, we want to join up. And I think [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2306.2s)]
*  we're, you know, planning our next waves of factory occupations, we're planning our next [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2314.52s)]
*  waves of lock ons, the the acquittals and the threats really just serve to galvanize us. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2320.44s)]
*  We're not going anywhere, I think is the real sort of important message here, the [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2331.96s)]
*  the threats are really nothing new either. The movement isn't going anywhere. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2340.28s)]
*  If people want to learn more about the work that Palestine action does, and, and possibly [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2347.24s)]
*  join the movement, where can they go? [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2354.7599999999998s)]
*  We have a great website recently hacked, but back online, Palestine action.org. There's a [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2358.6s)]
*  secure donation link there too, you can help us pay for ladders and climbing equipment. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2368.12s)]
*  The we've lost over 70 ladders to the British government, since Palestine action has started. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2375.24s)]
*  But, you know, I mean, just like the hacking of our website, the throwing us off of fundraising [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2381.56s)]
*  platforms, these are all things that the movement is actually strong enough to withstand if we are [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2392.68s)]
*  clear about what's happening. And, you know, as [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2400.6s)]
*  as if we draw upon as much support as we actually have, which is global and grassroots. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2405.4s)]
*  On that, obviously, a big, big important thing is really if you especially if you're not able to [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2415.1600000000003s)]
*  participate, then yeah, donate, you know, this is just an arms factory. This is one of the biggest [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2421.0s)]
*  sort of actions that were successful in the UK this campaign to shut down literally, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2426.44s)]
*  an entire arms company from a city. It's the only one, the only arms factory from Albert in the [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2432.4399999999996s)]
*  north of England, there were four altogether. So this is a prolonged campaign that we've won. But [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2437.64s)]
*  obviously, it takes resources. And there's a whole lot of money swishing around for Palestine. But [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2442.2s)]
*  actually, you know, a lot of the people from Gaza were telling me, this is a political problem. This [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2447.9599999999996s)]
*  is not an environmental disaster, where just we're going to keep spending stacks of cash on [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2452.6s)]
*  putting plasters on on the source of what will continue if there's no political solution. So [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2457.48s)]
*  where does politics start for this kind of situation? It's just like with the anti apartheid [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2462.84s)]
*  movement where they need international support. And we need to break the chains, especially with [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2468.12s)]
*  arms, because it's the weapons companies that are the most complicit that are the worst, especially [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2472.52s)]
*  the Israeli weapons company, Albert system. So donate, donate and help Palestine action. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2476.68s)]
*  And I wanted to add on terms of what the government can do. The government is always going to have [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2482.92s)]
*  powers to do things against normal people. People look at the civil rights movement in America, [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2487.08s)]
*  look at the Black Panthers, look at people were destroyed, people were imprisoned and tortured [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2493.64s)]
*  and killed in prison, trying to escape like George Jackson, so many others. So there's a there's a [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2498.36s)]
*  history of people who have probably even in Western countries, going to have had to face much worse [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2503.0s)]
*  than what people who were taking on these arms factories are going to face. Yes, there could be [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2509.24s)]
*  a cost. But ultimately, there has always been a cost for actions that shut down enormously [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2514.12s)]
*  important and powerful arms companies. It's very rare that such a such an enormous organization [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2520.2799999999997s)]
*  and all the resources behind it gets shut down. And the only way it's going to happen is, [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2527.3199999999997s)]
*  is if people take a bit of a risk here and there. And that's all that we're asking really, [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2532.2799999999997s)]
*  is that people just go a bit further. And again, if not to do that, try and support in lots of [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2536.2s)]
*  other ways. Because believe me, the majority of people around the autumn campaign were locals [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2541.8s)]
*  in the community that could just do anything they could. And they were just as important [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2545.88s)]
*  as anybody else for this campaign. And they chipped in enormously. And even today, the feeling and the [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2549.6400000000003s)]
*  warmth from everybody, the locals there and just everybody patting each other on the back. And we're [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2554.84s)]
*  just giving rounds of applause to about 50 different people. It was just epic. But again, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2559.8s)]
*  it was the sharp edge of the direct action that really got things moving and made it happen. And [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2567.88s)]
*  we're all just going to carry on celebrating this evening. And but most importantly, like I said, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlLkgL02M8&t=2573.0800000000004s)]
