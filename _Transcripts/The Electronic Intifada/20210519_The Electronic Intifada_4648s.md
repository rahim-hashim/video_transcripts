Video Description: On episode 35 of The Electronic Intifada Podcast, Nora, Asa and our colleague Tamara Nassar join Lara Elborno and Michael Schirtzer of the Palestine Pod to talk about the first few days of the US-backed Israeli attacks on Gaza.
‚ÄúAn occupied people has a right to engage in armed resistance against a foreign occupation. That‚Äôs it. Period,‚Äù says Elborno. ‚ÄúThere is no right for a colonial power to engage in a merciless assault against a civilian population that it cages.‚Äù
Since we recorded this episode, Lara‚Äôs relative, Hassan Elborno, was killed by Israeli bombing in the Gaza Strip. He was a farmer working on land near the eastern boundary line with Israel.
Later on in the program, Nora and Asa talk to Joharah Baker, a journalist and translator based in the Old City of Jerusalem, who discusses the last month of Israeli settler pogroms and attempts to expel Palestinians from the nearby neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah.
Baker also talks about the complicity of Joe Biden and US lawmakers in aiding and abetting Israel‚Äôs war crimes.
‚ÄúAnyone who looks to Biden as any kind of game-changer ‚Ä¶ sorry, they‚Äôre just delusional,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThe only way that policy will change is through funding. It has to be money, there‚Äôs really no other way. But I don‚Äôt see that happening yet. But I think that there is a movement ‚Ä¶ people are the ones who will make those changes.‚Äù

# Israel's war on Gaza and Jerusalem with Lara Elborno, Michael Schirtzer, Joharah Baker | EI Podcast
**The Electronic Intifada:** [May 19, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU)
*  I'll tell you the position right now. An occupied people has the right to use armed resistance against a foreign occupation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=0.0s)]
*  That's it. Period. There is no right for a colonial power to engage in a merciless assault against a civilian population that it cages. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=15.5s)]
*  That right simply doesn't exist. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=21.5s)]
*  I'm Nora Barrows-Freedman. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=30.5s)]
*  And I'm Asa Winstanley. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=32.5s)]
*  Joining us today on the Electronic Intifada podcast are the hosts of the Palestine pod, a brilliant new weekly podcast that focuses on Palestine with the aim of supporting Palestinian liberation, justice and equality on the ground and in exile. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=38.5s)]
*  Lara Elborno and Michael Scherzer. Thank you so much for being with us today. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=54.5s)]
*  Thank you for having us. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=60.5s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=62.5s)]
*  So there's so much to get into. This is, we're recording on day four of Israel's bombing campaign against Gaza. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=64.5s)]
*  Hundreds of airstrikes, you know, dozens and dozens of people slaughtered. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=70.5s)]
*  Lara, you have family on the ground in Gaza. How is your family? What are you hearing from them? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=76.5s)]
*  Well, Nora, the situation is absolutely brutal. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=85.0s)]
*  Every person in Gaza who I have spoken to, family and otherwise, has reaffirmed that the last few nights in Gaza have been more brutal in terms of the sheer amount of shelling than all three of the last military assaults on Gaza combined. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=89.0s)]
*  The shelling has essentially not stopped. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=104.0s)]
*  Nobody has slept in days. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=106.0s)]
*  And the people are very tired. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=108.0s)]
*  My uncle and his and our family are sending us voice notes every morning. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=110.5s)]
*  And I can hear the fear in their voices. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=116.5s)]
*  I can hear, you know, the trembling. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=120.5s)]
*  I can even hear the shelling actually, because it doesn't stop in the morning. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=122.5s)]
*  It doesn't stop in the afternoon. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=126.5s)]
*  And so, you know, there are moments where he'll be sending me a message and I can hear in the background the shelling. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=128.5s)]
*  And this is actually very consistent with what we have seen on the Instagram lives that have been taking place over the last few days with direct footage from Gaza that is basically showing the situation, you know, unedited footage for hours on end and interrupting the interviews is always, you know, there's a new explosion. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=133.0s)]
*  There's new shelling, you know, turning the camera. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=151.0s)]
*  I mean, this is something that we are seeing again and again. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=153.0s)]
*  But at the same time, we are in the first day of the Eid holiday and Palestinian people teach life. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=156.0s)]
*  And so, you know, we saw an article from the New York Times today about a family that insisted on celebrating their daughter's birthday. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=162.5s)]
*  People are still celebrating Eid in their homes. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=168.5s)]
*  They're trying to live as normally as possible, knowing that their death can be moments away. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=170.5s)]
*  But that is who we are as a people. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=174.5s)]
*  And as for Israel, Israel is on a genocidal campaign. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=176.5s)]
*  Netanyahu has talked about hitting Gaza strikes that they have never dreamed of. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=179.5s)]
*  He promised us that this is just the beginning. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=185.5s)]
*  I'm sure, Nora and Asa, you saw that they have already leveled four entire residential buildings in Gaza. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=188.0s)]
*  Those residential buildings house hundreds of families. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=196.0s)]
*  I mean, can you imagine an entire 15-story residential building that was leveled in a manner that looks like a planned demolition? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=199.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I mean, I think we have to ask ourselves, what do we expect people to do and how do we expect people to react to this kind of brutality? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=206.0s)]
*  I mean, the problem is that Palestinians have been so dehumanized for many decades that we don't even offer them the possibility of reacting the way that any human being would. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=215.5s)]
*  The scenes out of Gaza right now in 2021 look like the Nakba of 1948. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=226.5s)]
*  People are leaving their homes with bags of their belongings and the clothes on their back. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=231.5s)]
*  And the kids are walking out with no shoes and they're just trying to find anywhere to go. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=236.5s)]
*  But of course, it's actually even worse than the Nakba of 1948 because in Gaza you have no place to go. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=241.0s)]
*  There is no place to escape to. There is no safe zone. There is no, you know, no fire zone. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=246.0s)]
*  They can't leave Gaza because the very same entity which is pummeling them with these airstrikes is the same entity that has imposed a 15-year long military siege on Gaza, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=252.0s)]
*  a blockade that has basically sealed off the border and also a naval blockade that makes it impossible for them to even escape by sea if they wanted, right? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=264.5s)]
*  So we're talking about caging 2 million people. These people, remember 80% of them are refugees. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=272.5s)]
*  These people aren't even, the majority of them aren't even from Gaza. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=279.5s)]
*  The majority of them trace their origin to the cities and villages that they were expelled from in 1948 at the time of the creation of the State of Israel. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=281.5s)]
*  They just want to go back home, but instead of being able to go back home, which is their right, enshrined under international law, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=292.0s)]
*  not only can they not go back home, but they must sit in Gaza subjugated and just at the mercy of Israel's bombs. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=297.0s)]
*  So this is a situation that we have in Gaza and, you know, I have to admit that we have to always keep in mind our role in this. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=305.0s)]
*  As the United States, we are the primary funder of Israel. Israel is the world's largest recipient of US foreign aid. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=314.0s)]
*  If there are Americans that listen to this podcast that think it's not their problem, I'm sorry to say that that's simply not the case. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=320.5s)]
*  Unless you like funding genocide, in which case, you know, go off. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=326.5s)]
*  I mean, it has been the US's modus operandi for 500 years. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=329.5s)]
*  But yeah, can you talk a little bit more about like your family and where they live? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=336.0s)]
*  What, how they're even like dealing with these last four days? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=345.0s)]
*  Yeah, so they're in Gaza City. I don't want to give more information than that for obvious reasons. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=350.0s)]
*  And, you know, Gazans are very creative people and they are strategic and they learn how to deal with these things. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=355.0s)]
*  So, you know, they know, for example, that when the assaults start to come, you have to open the windows. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=364.5s)]
*  You have to open the windows so that the windows don't get blown out by the shelling and then end up, you know, reverberating in the house and causing injuries or death. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=367.5s)]
*  They know that you have to sit as close as possible to the center of the room. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=378.5s)]
*  They know that you have to stay as close as possible to the ground. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=382.5s)]
*  I mean, these are things that they have learned over time and these are things that no human being should ever have to try to strategize or understand. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=384.5s)]
*  And, you know, the feeling is very much that, look, there's nothing that we can do, but we know that our cause is just. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=392.0s)]
*  And the thing is, is when you know that your cause is just, you can at least die with dignity. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=400.0s)]
*  And this is very much the feeling in Gaza. You can at least die with dignity. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=405.0s)]
*  You can at least die knowing that you were defending Al-Aqsa mosque, which was being invaded, subject to stun grenades, sound bombs, live ammunition, rubber bullets. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=408.0s)]
*  You know, they fired on hundreds of people in Al-Aqsa. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=417.5s)]
*  You know, there were hundreds of injuries. Several people lost their eyes. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=420.5s)]
*  I mean, this is this is a very aggressive and violent response on the part of Israel right now, all throughout Palestine, right? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=424.5s)]
*  Historic Palestine, all of it. 48, the West Bank, you know, Sheikh Jarrah, obviously Jerusalem and also Gaza. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=434.5s)]
*  Everything is connected right now. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=441.5s)]
*  It's been about 100 years of ethnic cleansing and we've still got people who are like, we got to stop this cycle, guys. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=444.0s)]
*  Right. As though, yeah, it's like, you know, oh, I don't know what precipitated this. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=451.0s)]
*  But like Biden said, I hope that it comes to an end soon. Right. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=457.0s)]
*  Yeah, we have we have these. I mean, just the most passive and and and diabolical responses from U.S. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=461.0s)]
*  politicians, from European politicians who are, you know, basically sending their thoughts and prayers while they're writing, you know, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=471.5s)]
*  checks for billions and billions of dollars so that Israel can continue its military occupation and colonization of Palestine. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=478.5s)]
*  Let's talk a little bit about what's happening in 48, especially in present day Israel as Palestinian citizens are rising up [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=487.5s)]
*  in tandem with Palestinians in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=497.0s)]
*  There have been sustained rebellions in the streets of major cities like Lid and Yaffa and Haifa and Nazareth [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=501.0s)]
*  against these Israeli pogroms. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=512.0s)]
*  We're also seeing literal lynch mobs in the streets by Israelis who are going after any Palestinian they see walking down the street. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=517.5s)]
*  They're even breaking into people's homes. As we saw, I think it was in Haifa. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=527.5s)]
*  There was a video that was circulating of people, you know, Israeli mobs literally breaking into Palestinian families' homes and trying to destroy everything and everyone inside. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=530.5s)]
*  Yeah, and that video was really terrifying and it turns out that it was actually Israeli police doing that. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=545.0s)]
*  And the fact that there was one video and the next video and in the second video you could see their uniforms, but in the first you couldn't quite see their uniforms [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=553.0s)]
*  but you could see them at the door. And I mean, the fact that you couldn't tell the difference initially between the mobs. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=563.0s)]
*  Right. Well, they're one in the same. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=569.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=572.0s)]
*  It's really just what they decided to wear that day. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=573.5s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Right. Yeah, it's a matter of, you know, whatever outfit they picked out for that day. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=575.5s)]
*  Yeah, they chose a uniform. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=581.5s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Let's talk about this. I mean, this is really, I think as you said, Lara, in email exchange over the last couple days between me and you [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=583.5s)]
*  this was like Israel's worst nightmare where the Palestinian citizens of the state are unifying and trying to liberate their cities. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=596.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, look, a key takeaway from the events of the last few days is that Palestinians have affirmed that there is no difference between a Palestinian in Gaza or a Palestinian in 48 or a Palestinian in Jerusalem or a Palestinian in exile. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=605.0s)]
*  Okay, the organization that we have seen, the resistance, the creativity, the sheer energy, all of it, the harnessing of the power of the independent media and the social media platforms, you know, even if our lives get cut, even if you erase our stories, even if you block our accounts, we don't care. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=621.5s)]
*  We're going to act collectively as one. And, you know, the message I think that Palestinians are sending is that, you know, what we've been living for the last almost 74 years is, in fact, ethnic cleansing. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=633.5s)]
*  And it's all part of the same issue, right? So the idea is that the origin of the problem isn't always has been this campaign of ethnic cleansing that has been committed by the Zionists since 1948, right? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=647.0s)]
*  And earlier even, but lasting until today. The Palestinians that we're seeing around the world, there were even some uprisings in refugee camps in Lebanon and Jordan. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=662.0s)]
*  There were protests in the diaspora, the Palestinians that are in, you know, New York City, Chicago, London, all of us. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=673.5s)]
*  We are refugees, all of us, either we're refugees or descendants of refugees. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=680.5s)]
*  You know, ask any Palestinian that lives outside of Palestine, ask anyone, what is the story of your grandparents? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=684.5s)]
*  And it's a story of a refugee who was expelled from their house and prevented from going back. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=691.5s)]
*  That is a unanimous story. None of us left by choice. We were all expelled. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=696.5s)]
*  And so right now, I think what you're seeing is this affirmation, this clear message that is being sent by Palestinians that the issue is and always has been ethnic cleansing. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=702.0s)]
*  And, you know, we must dismantle this myth that it's not about 1948, that it's somehow only about this military occupation that started in 1967. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=715.0s)]
*  And yes, of course, that is a major problem and the military occupation must end. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=724.0s)]
*  But the reality is all of the injustice can be traced back to the NECBA. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=727.5s)]
*  And, you know, it's of course not lost on me that we are filming this podcast two days before May 15th, which is going to be the 74th anniversary of the NECBA. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=730.5s)]
*  Yeah, Tamara, you've been looking into this issue of what's been happening in inside 1948 Palestine, in inside present day Israel. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=741.5s)]
*  I understand. So maybe you could tell us a little bit about the latest as well. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=755.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, Lara is absolutely right in that what we're seeing, what makes this time very different than any time I've ever witnessed in Palestine, is that this is a popular uprising by Palestinians throughout their homeland and in the diaspora. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=762.0s)]
*  This is why Israel, as our colleague Maureen Murphy wrote a few days ago, cannot win no matter how much it escalates its bombing campaign in Gaza. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=780.5s)]
*  Israel has for decades tried to disconnect Palestinians from their identity. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=789.5s)]
*  It tried to erase their Palestinian identity and disconnect their struggle from that of other Palestinians in the West Bank, in Gaza, in 48, in the diaspora and otherwise. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=794.5s)]
*  And now that we're seeing Palestinians rise in the occupied West Bank, in Gaza, in Lid, it's one indication that this effort to erase this national consciousness among Palestinians has failed. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=805.0s)]
*  And we have learned this from the very first day of this recent escalation, when the Palestinian resistance organization that governs Israel's internal affairs, Hamas, gave Israel one hour to clear the al-Aqsa Mosque compound, to release detainees and to clear Sheikh Jarrah. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=819.5s)]
*  And then it fired its rockets to Jerusalem after Israel refused to do so. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=840.5s)]
*  What happened then is that the Palestinian resistance in Gaza proved that the bombing in Gaza is never separate from Palestinian struggle throughout the West Bank. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=847.0s)]
*  And that Israel's attacks on worshippers, on medics, on journalists in al-Aqsa Mosque, injuring hundreds over last weekend, cannot go with Palestinians sitting silent and doing nothing. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=859.0s)]
*  And this is what is terrifying Israel the most right now. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=871.5s)]
*  As we've been seeing mixed reports in Israeli media about whether Israel's trying to escalate or not. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=874.5s)]
*  And what Israel's fearing is that it's losing control in its internal cities like Lid, in Remle, in Haifa, and it doesn't know where to focus its campaign of oppression. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=881.5s)]
*  Yeah, I think I saw a report that Benjamin Netanyahu had said something along the lines that Israel is now fighting a war on two fronts. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=898.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=907.0s)]
*  Talking about Gaza as one front and its own Palestinian so-called citizens of Israel as another front. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=907.5s)]
*  Right. I mean, the mayor of Lid, a Jewish Israeli, called on the Netanyahu administration to bring the military forces into the city. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=915.0s)]
*  Yeah, the border police. Where is the border? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=926.5s)]
*  Yeah, he was right. I mean, the border police are in Yaffa, which is on the coast. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=928.5s)]
*  Yeah, Israel is always nude. It's Palestinian citizens as foreigners sitting there. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=933.5s)]
*  And, you know, there are over 60 laws, 60 Israeli laws that directly and indirectly discriminate against Palestinian citizens of Israel. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=941.5s)]
*  They are treated at best like second class citizens. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=951.5s)]
*  And this is what, you know, we've been seeing, you know, the Human Rights Watch and Israeli Human Rights Group at Salem come out and finally say, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=955.0s)]
*  after Palestinians have been saying it for decades, that Israel is an apartheid state. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=962.0s)]
*  But what most people don't understand is that this apartheid extends beyond the West Bank and Gaza, and it applies to Palestinian citizens of Israel. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=966.0s)]
*  And they too are considered second class citizens by Israel at best. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=973.0s)]
*  I just wanted to add that I've been getting numerous firsthand messages from Palestinians inside 48 that are reporting that the Zionists have been going around [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=978.5s)]
*  and actually marking the outside of their houses with numbers representing the number of people who are inside the house. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=987.5s)]
*  And they believe that they will then use that to come around a second time, invade their houses and commit crimes, injuries, possibly death. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=995.5s)]
*  But numerous Palestinians from 48 have told me that they woke up this morning to find the outside of their house marked with numbers. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1006.0s)]
*  And they can only assume what that means. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1013.0s)]
*  You've been doing a lot of work, you know, on the podcast and in your stand up comedy and on social media trying to kind of expose Zionism for what it is. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1016.0s)]
*  And you've been very personal about the fact that you grew up in a Jewish Zionist family. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1032.5s)]
*  It seems to me, also as a Jewish person, that there is this massive shift taking place in American Jewish, especially the young community. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1041.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1052.5s)]
*  Where, you know, Zionism is such, you know, I mean, it's a disgusting ideology and the racist ideology and young Jews in particular more and more often are now seeing it for what it is [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1054.0s)]
*  and are pushing back against their families and, you know, their communities, their synagogues. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1073.0s)]
*  What do you think is contributing to this shift and is that an accurate assessment? [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1079.5s)]
*  Yeah, I absolutely believe that, you know, the future of Jewish activism looks a lot like the past, actually, right? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1086.5s)]
*  Because there is a huge and rich history of Jewish communist labor organizing. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1094.5s)]
*  And I think that there is going to be a return to that. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1101.5s)]
*  Given the state of affairs, people can no longer ignore the atrocities that are happening. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1105.0s)]
*  We are watching pogroms live in real time. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1110.0s)]
*  People are streaming them on their phones, right? [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1113.0s)]
*  It looks like I'm looking at my own family. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1116.0s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1119.0s)]
*  I cannot stand by and just, you know, watch a cooking video or something. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1120.0s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1127.0s)]
*  And there are people who will not want to mess up their aesthetic. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1128.0s)]
*  Fam, if your aesthetic allows you to be silent during genocide, you are a psycho. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1132.5s)]
*  But I am hopeful about the future because I see so many young Jewish activists who are outright denouncing Zionism. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1137.5s)]
*  There are others who are conditioning their support for Zionism, which is a clear concession, something they almost never do. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1148.5s)]
*  I think part of it is really just that some of the very typical Zionist myths that we are accustomed to hearing [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1155.5s)]
*  every time there is a flare up of colonial violence, you know, like the oh, Israel has a right to defend itself or oh, the Hamas rockets or oh, Palestinians did this. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1161.5s)]
*  All of these myths, I think right now in 2021, we're seeing that they are being dismantled before our eyes. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1170.0s)]
*  We are seeing clear connections with this type of reasoning and sort of all lives matter reasoning. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1176.5s)]
*  I came across a meme that had that today that had, you know, thousands of likes. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1184.0s)]
*  We're seeing the reinforcement of this idea that there is no moral equivalence between a colonial power that has been imposing an apartheid system of governance on a subjugated native population and the legal armed resistance of an occupied nation. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1188.5s)]
*  And I think the public is moving towards this understanding, you know, that both sides ism is grossly insufficient in the context of the discussion on Palestine. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1202.5s)]
*  You must take a position. You must take a position. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1211.5s)]
*  And the only morally sound position is to say very clearly that the clock does not start running when Hamas fires a rocket. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1215.5s)]
*  The clock starts running at ethnic cleansing. The clock starts running when a European led movement showed up in Palestine in 1948. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1222.5s)]
*  And, you know, not only wanted to stay in Palestine, right, because, you know, there isn't so much of a problem with the notion of immigrants coming to a new country. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1229.5s)]
*  Plenty of Palestinian scholars have said this before, and they've said that, you know, look, if these people wanted to stay as immigrants, fine. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1237.5s)]
*  There are plenty of examples in history where Palestine has welcomed immigrants. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1243.5s)]
*  Take, for example, the Armenian population. They came to Palestine after World War One and they became Palestinian-Armenian. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1247.5s)]
*  So, you know, we have no problem with this. The problem, however, is when not only do they want to come to the land, but they want to replace us on the land. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1253.5s)]
*  And that's where we draw the line. We draw the line at ethnic cleansing. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1262.5s)]
*  And I think that's a reasonable position to take. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1265.5s)]
*  Anyway, I want to talk about I'm in communication with some people who are on the ground and the tactics for resistance are evolving in such a great way. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1268.5s)]
*  I don't want to share too much, but I will say they're lubricating the floors with soapy water so that soldiers will slip and fall in their Ninja Turtle suits. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1277.5s)]
*  Right. Like it has completely changed the way that the police and the military are able to operate. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1287.5s)]
*  They can't just run into buildings anymore because they got to be ginger-footed. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1293.5s)]
*  Apparently, Home Alone is a military training video. You know what I'm saying? [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1297.5s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1301.5s)]
*  I mean, you know, yeah, the resistance tactics have to be creative. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1305.5s)]
*  When you're not, when this is, it's... [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1313.5s)]
*  When you don't have an army. There's no army. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1316.5s)]
*  And it's mostly children. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1319.5s)]
*  Right. Right. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1321.5s)]
*  Tamara, did you want to, did you have something you wanted to add? [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1323.5s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, when Michael was talking about pogroms being filmed on live television, on people's social media, the other thing that is being filmed is Israeli leaders themselves filming themselves [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1328.5s)]
*  with direct threats to Palestinian civilians in Gaza that likely constitutes evidence of premeditated intent to commit war crimes. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1347.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1356.5s)]
*  Yesterday, Israel's defense minister, so-called defense minister, Israel's war minister, Benny Gantz, who was already a war criminal from Israel's assault on Gaza in 2014, when he ordered military strikes that killed more than 2,200 Palestinians, including 550 children. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1357.5s)]
*  And he had 11 children per day, as the assault was 51 days long. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1376.5s)]
*  Yesterday, Benny Gantz posted through Kogat, which is the bureaucratic arm of Israel's military occupation, a one minute and a half video, which is, which was like a pre-recorded address to Palestinian citizens of Gaza. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1381.5s)]
*  He told them, and I'm quoting, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1398.5s)]
*  Gaza residents. The last time that we met on Eid al-Fitr, I was chief of staff during Operation Protective Edge. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1400.5s)]
*  If Hamas does not stop its violence, the strike of 2021 will be harder and more painful than that of 2014. Later in the video, he said Gaza will burn. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1408.5s)]
*  How can we understand from this other than a direct threat to Palestinian civilians in Gaza? [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1420.5s)]
*  And this should go directly to the International Criminal Court to investigate this evidence of premeditated intent to commit war crimes in Gaza. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1427.5s)]
*  To commit genocide. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1436.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1437.5s)]
*  Correct. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1439.5s)]
*  What investigation? We're watching it. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1440.5s)]
*  Yeah, you've got you've got another Israeli member of parliament, Bezelad Smotrich, who is an author of a plan to expel Palestinians that was called by prominent Israeli scholar of the Holocaust, potentially genocidal. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1442.5s)]
*  Yesterday he tweeted, or the day before yesterday, on Tuesday, he tweeted, flatten the strip. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1457.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1464.5s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Okay. This is just the beginning, he said yesterday, as he was announcing the assassination of Hamas senior Hamas commanders in the Gaza Strip. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1466.5s)]
*  We will hit them with strikes they have never dreamed of. Okay. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1478.5s)]
*  I just want to say, when, you know, when pundits ask, ask guests on their on their shows and they tell them, you know, how can we bring this this escalation to the end. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1484.5s)]
*  What can both sides do to de escalate the situation, Hamas Israel Hamas Israel. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1497.5s)]
*  Every single rocket that Israel drops missile that Israel drops on Gaza is optional, and they can stop doing it, and they make the decision every single time they drop a missile on Gaza, and to, and to annihilate a family. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1503.5s)]
*  This is, this is a choice that they make and they can choose to stop launching this ongoing campaign on on Palestinians. The other thing that I wanted to mention when we were talking about. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1520.5s)]
*  How the media cycle basically starts from a rocket that Hamas fires and starts from on Sunday when when Hamas fired rockets to Jerusalem. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1532.5s)]
*  The Zionist entity is a foreign military occupier. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1546.5s)]
*  It is always already the, the initiator of all aggression against Palestinians no matter where you start with Palestinian history, you want to go back to Sunday, you want to go back to 14 years ago when Israel began its siege on the Gaza Strip you want to go back to 67 with the occupation of the West Bank or the Syrian Golan Heights or the Gaza Strip, or do you want to go back to 48 when Israel, or, you know what was then Zionist militias forcibly expelled 800,000 Palestinians from their homes. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1551.5s)]
*  No matter where you go back in Palestinian history, Israel's always already the initiator of all aggression, and it can choose to end aggression against against it by or self defense against it by stopping the bombing campaign and lifting its occupation and lifting its siege. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1580.5s)]
*  There's all idea that like okay there can be a good form of Zionism, you know there's this liberal Zionism that exists. I mean, it's just a lie, you know we're seeing all these attempts to try to rebrand Zionism, you know, Zionism is a feeling Zionism is an emotion it's an identity. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1599.5s)]
*  It's like a, it's like a she her he him Zionist you know what I mean, that's what that's what they're doing now. No, I've literally seen that on Twitter profiles. Thank you. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1619.5s)]
*  People will be like you're attacking my identity and it's like your identity is fascism. Yeah, no I mean the British left especially has fallen for this whole thing to a large extent like at least the sort of, I guess, establishment left but yeah it's. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1628.5s)]
*  Yeah, I mean look Zionism is racism and that's it like we absolutely can't accept this, and, you know, it's Zionism is a political ideology you know it's a racist colonial political ideology, that's what it is, you know, it's simple as that. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1646.5s)]
*  Yeah, I was telling some friends of mine earlier today, who, like, I don't know, my non political friends you could call them, and, and they just, you know, they, they obviously they know what I do and stuff and so they were asking me like what what's happening. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1661.5s)]
*  Because they were saying I was watching the news and I was, I was feeling confused about said look what it comes down to is just this it's, it's not complex. Right, it's, it's a settler colonial project it's a European settler colonial project. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1676.5s)]
*  That's it, you know it's it's simple as that you know, Palestinians have been driven out of their homes by the state of Israel, solely because they're not Jewish that's what it comes down to, you know, this is the form of supremacy. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1693.5s)]
*  It's similar to white supremacy in South Africa, or, or in North America, you know, and so, yeah, there's this whole industry of think tankers and journalists dedicated towards making the conflict, the conflict seem that you know complex and oh you have to have a PhD to talk about it. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1708.5s)]
*  Without straying into anti semitism and all this kind of stuff. And it's not, you know, it's absolutely not. You don't, you don't need. You don't need a PhD you don't need some sort of special qualification to understand basic injustice, you know. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1728.5s)]
*  Yeah, as I always say it doesn't really matter what Zionism means to you and theory you know in your mind. We have to judge Zionism very logically by its consequences, and the consequences of Zionism are the creation of the world's largest refugee problem, the removal of [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1747.5s)]
*  the population the subjugation of those who remain as well as clear attempts to continue to remove more and more Palestinians from the land. The story of Sheikh Jarrah itself, just look at the story of Sheikh Jarrah itself. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1764.5s)]
*  That story is the story of a Palestinian family that continues to get kicked off of their land. This is not the first time. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1778.5s)]
*  They trace their first expulsion back to 48. Right. And then they were they were expelled to Sheikh Jarrah and then you know they they they I believe their house was was taken more than once when they were after they were expelled from 48 so this is what we're dealing with. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1785.5s)]
*  The truth is that the creation of the state itself to its constantly expanding borders, which it has never defined by the way. This is what we are seeing at every step of the way. And every single policy every single Israeli policy right from the [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1802.5s)]
*  to the demolishing of Palestinian homes to the expulsion of Palestinians from their homes to the building of their settlement to the pummeling of you know Gaza with bombs, every single policy every single relationship between Israel and Palestinians is rooted in the desire to remove Palestinians from Palestine. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1817.5s)]
*  That's it. And these are not my words. These are the words of the Israeli politicians themselves. They are the ones who invented the term demographic control. They are the ones who use these other genocidal terms like mowing the lawn when they refer to the assaults that they carry out on Gaza. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1836.5s)]
*  They are the ones that speak about putting Gazans on a calorie restricted diet. This is genocide. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1851.5s)]
*  Right. I know ism is not an identity. Zionism is not an identity. It's a bunch of war crimes in a trench coat. Okay. And the propaganda is so deep that like some production company will probably make a movie about how they siege the third holiest site in Islam during Ramadan and how it really took a toll on the soldiers. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1858.5s)]
*  Of course. Guys, did you see that tweet from the IDF itself talking about how like it's been a really tough couple of days, but it's been really great to wake up and just have your support. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1877.5s)]
*  Yeah, I think it was from the from the Israel account itself. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1890.5s)]
*  Yeah, it was from the Israel account. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1894.5s)]
*  So look really exhausting to kill like, yeah, so all these children in like, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1897.5s)]
*  Like we've been holed up in bomb shelters, but it's so nice to get these, you know, words of support from you guys. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1903.5s)]
*  Yeah, let me read it to you. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1910.5s)]
*  But I mean, I think in all seriousness, the the kind of mental gymnastics that these propaganda government. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1911.5s)]
*  Either government propaganda accounts or government aligned propaganda accounts probably as well propaganda. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1919.5s)]
*  They go through seriously like the mental gymnastics they do go through. It must be literally exhausting for them. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1924.5s)]
*  You know, they can qualify. They suffer. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1931.5s)]
*  They can qualify for the Olympics with those mental gymnastics. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1934.5s)]
*  It's great. And the other thing that really annoys me about liberal Zionists is how, and especially in this country in Britain is their support for the Israeli Labour Party. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1937.5s)]
*  This is something we've really seen in the British left and the whole campaign, the fabricated anti semitism campaign against Jeremy Corbyn, which successfully deposed him as leader of the Labour Party and prevented him from becoming Prime Minister. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1949.5s)]
*  These so called left wing Zionist groups, they're very open in they define themselves as Zionist groups. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1966.5s)]
*  But then when you say, you know, these are Zionist groups, they accuse you of anti semitism because you're using their own terms for themselves. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1973.5s)]
*  And they support they they're open like the Jewish Labour movement, the the the so called left wing Zionist group, officially affiliated to the British Labour Party. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1983.5s)]
*  It says on its on its website on a switch profile, we support the Israeli Labour Party, you know, and as if that and they they criticize we criticize the Netanyahu government or what the Netanyahu government is really is doing is really appalling. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=1994.5s)]
*  Yeah, so what did the Israeli Labour Party do? What did what did the Israeli Labour Party? Israeli Labour Party carried out the worst crimes against Palestinians. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2011.5s)]
*  Yeah, you know, what no matter where you go back to, you know, 1967 carried out by the Israeli Labour Party's political antecedents, you know, 1948 the Nakba, who led the Nakba who led the expulsion of the Palestinians, Ben Gurion, Ben Gurion, you know, it wasn't Jabotinsky. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2020.5s)]
*  You know, it wasn't the Jabotinskyites who participated in it as well, but they only had a supporting role. It was the forces the armed forces of David Ben Gurion. So Labour Zionism is is just as bad as right wing Zionism, if not worse. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2041.5s)]
*  These cartoonish evil leaders like Benjamin Netanyahu and Donald Trump were a great gift to liberals, because now they can point and say, you know, the problem isn't Zionism, but Netanyahu is Israel. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2059.5s)]
*  The problem isn't imperialism, but Donald Trump, and, and it's just used as a scapegoat. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2075.5s)]
*  Right. And now, now that Biden is at the helm, they're curiously very silent. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2082.5s)]
*  Just take just take for example, the moving of the US Embassy to occupy Jerusalem. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2090.5s)]
*  Right. Okay, this was this was a Trump move. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2095.5s)]
*  You would expect that when Biden took office, that he would have reversed this move because this was severely condemned by so called liberals at the time of, of the decision to move the embassy. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2098.5s)]
*  Right. And of course, the DNC official position was we're not moving it back. Right. We're not moving the embassy back. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2111.5s)]
*  That was the one of the first things that they said that they were not going to do. Right. In terms of foreign policy decision. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2118.5s)]
*  Yeah, because I mean, in practice, the Democrat Democratic Party leaders have actually always supported moving the embassy to Jerusalem. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2124.5s)]
*  They're glad that Trump did it and they didn't have to do it themselves. Yeah, they just didn't want to do that with the PR fallout of it. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2131.5s)]
*  Whereas, whereas Trump didn't care. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2137.5s)]
*  Right. Also, you reported that the Labor Party just hired a former spy from Israel. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2140.5s)]
*  I remember reading that story and thinking, oh, wow, they're not even trying to hide it anymore. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2145.5s)]
*  I couldn't have made it up. I could not. I still can't believe that story. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2151.5s)]
*  I mean, but I mean, obviously, as usual, we check everything. I mean, I verified this story. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2155.5s)]
*  I mean, it's been and it's been confirmed as well. But I still still can't believe it. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2161.5s)]
*  And that that's why that spy comes from Unit 8200, which is the cyber intelligence force that is responsible for blackmailing, surveilling Palestinians, making sure that they have absolutely no human rights. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2167.5s)]
*  And now one of those former employees is working PR for the Labor Party in the UK while they just got rid of Jeremy Corbyn. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2179.5s)]
*  Let's let's talk about let's talk about the BDS campaign a little bit. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2186.5s)]
*  And, you know, people I mean, have been getting messages for the last week. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2193.5s)]
*  You know, what can we do? This is horrible. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2199.5s)]
*  You know, obviously, like the Biden administration isn't going to cut aid on their own without any pressure. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2203.5s)]
*  Like, how are we what can what can people do? [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2210.5s)]
*  And of course, there's the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign, which is, you know, one of the things like the least you can do is not to buy Israeli products. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2214.5s)]
*  Right. But but but talk about, you know, how how you both see, you know, BDS organizing, especially in times of of crisis and accelerated ethnic cleansing like we're seeing now. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2224.5s)]
*  And and and you know what how important it is right now to not just like organize for Palestinian rights through the BDS campaign or alongside the BDS campaign, but also take lawmakers to task. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2239.5s)]
*  You know, these lawmakers like, you know, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez yesterday, she, you know, kind of like tacitly condemned Biden's thing about it was basically like a, you know, hope and prayers sort of statement. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2256.5s)]
*  And, you know, Ocasio-Cortez said, you know, this is just a blanket statement if you don't stand in solidarity with Palestinians and, you know, and support their human rights. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2270.5s)]
*  She said that she's a lawmaker. She has power. And she said nothing about demanding that, you know, the United States cut all aid immediately to the Israeli military and its government. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2279.5s)]
*  She said nothing about about her support of the BDS campaign if she supports it or not. She's she so so that you know as I pointed out like that itself is a blanket statement you can't just like call for solidarity without concrete demands, especially as a [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2291.5s)]
*  as a lawmaker. So how do you guys see those demands and and and what's the importance of BDS right now? [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2306.5s)]
*  Look, if there's one thing that we've learned from the events of the last few weeks, it's that Palestinians are not going to wait for anyone to liberate them. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2313.5s)]
*  Okay, not the Arab governments that are completely sedated or, you know, fully in bed with Israel, whose relationships were formalized by the wave of normalization that we saw in the last few years. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2325.5s)]
*  Palestinians are not going to wait for the PA, you know, they just canceled elections. First elections in 15 years were canceled a few weeks ago. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2338.5s)]
*  Curious timing. We're certainly not going to wait for the EU who to my knowledge has been completely unconscious for the last month. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2345.5s)]
*  I'm not aware of any statements actually that have been put out by the EU. I could be wrong. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2352.5s)]
*  We're not going to wait for the US either. We've all seen the cliffs of the State Department spokesperson Ned Price. He struggled. He was sweating through all the layers of his clothing to respond to the very simple question of whether Palestinians have a right to defend themselves. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2356.5s)]
*  And guess what, guys? The answer is again, not complicated. Like much of the realities of this so-called conflict. The position in international law is crystal clear. I'm an international lawyer and I'm telling you the position right now. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2371.5s)]
*  An occupied people has the right to use armed resistance against a foreign occupation. That's it. Period. There is no right for colonial power to engage in a merciless assault against the civilian population that it cages. That right simply doesn't exist. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2382.5s)]
*  So this notion that Israel has a right to defend itself is completely framing the power dynamics. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2394.5s)]
*  And if you're interested in learning more about this, the Palestinian legal scholar and law professor Nora Ericka penned an article in 2012 about the legality of armed resistance under international law by an occupied people. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2400.5s)]
*  So look, I think if there's one thing we can take away from these events, it's that we have to listen to the people, right? The Palestinian people. They are the ones who are going to liberate themselves. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2412.5s)]
*  And the Palestinian people have called for BDS. They have, you know, people ask, what can I do to help? Palestinian people have told you what you can do to help support BDS. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2423.5s)]
*  That includes not buying Israeli goods, but it's more than that. It includes calling on your representatives to condition aid to Israel and eventually end aid to Israel. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2433.5s)]
*  But then even beyond that, sanction Israel for its violations of international law. Right? So this is there's multiple levels to this. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2442.5s)]
*  And it's the simplest thing that you can do is exercise your choice as a consumer. Right? To make ethical choices, to use capitalism against them. Right? To use it as a weapon. Right? [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2449.5s)]
*  And so I think BDS is critical at a time like this. And, you know, words are fine. I'm fine. You know, when a U.S. official comes out with a strongly worded statement every once in a while, and you know, it can happen. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2463.5s)]
*  Some of them have been less strong than others. Fine. But words have never compelled Israel to cease its violations of international law, to cease violating human rights. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2475.5s)]
*  That has never happened. OK, the light critiques, you know, of Israel's actions, you know, the slap on the wrist that we see every once in a while. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2485.5s)]
*  But then yet simultaneously the blank check, the three point eight billion dollars per year that, you know, is happening at the same time. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2493.5s)]
*  That combination, that approach that, you know, to Israel has never resulted in a concrete change for Palestinian lives. Right. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2500.5s)]
*  So we need to listen to Palestinians and Palestinians have asked for BDS. It's as simple as that. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2510.5s)]
*  Yeah, I want to quote Fanon. We revolt simply because for many reasons we can no longer breathe and each generation must discover its mission, fulfill it or betray it. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2515.5s)]
*  We have now discovered the mission. Right. The mission is BDS. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2527.5s)]
*  What we have to do is not betray it. And it's up to every single one of us, whether you're directing your target at, you know, Elbit for their weapons or whether you're at the grocery store thinking about buying a cereal made by General Mills or ice cream made in Ben and Jerry's West Bank production facility. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2532.5s)]
*  You need to be the type of person who makes that decision every single day. Right. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2554.5s)]
*  And it's with every single purchase you make every single your diet is not just what you ingest with food. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2560.5s)]
*  It's what you ingest with words, with with reading, with media. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2567.5s)]
*  So you need to limit the Zionist propaganda. Right. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2571.5s)]
*  Try and expunge it completely if possible and expose yourself to people who know what they're talking about. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2574.5s)]
*  Palestinians who've lived through this. Right. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2580.5s)]
*  They're they're so loud. They're they're screaming. They've been screaming. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2584.5s)]
*  So what we need to do is we need to flip the Zionist logic so that things are back as they should be. Right. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2590.5s)]
*  That things start to make sense again, and people's human rights are taken care of. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2597.5s)]
*  I think finally, Laura, if yeah, like, can you talk a little bit about what, you know, [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2602.5s)]
*  you just the next few days, we kind of have a sense of what's going to happen and what's because of what's been happening and the threats by the Israeli leaders, as Tamara mentioned. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2614.5s)]
*  What what are you thinking about right now when you think about your family in Gaza? [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2627.5s)]
*  How would anyone think? I mean, I think my reaction is at once one of I can't believe this is happening to. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2633.5s)]
*  You know, this is just outrageous. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2643.5s)]
*  I mean, there's nothing I can do to help them concretely. Right. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2645.5s)]
*  The only thing I can do is use my voice in exile to try to make people understand, [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2649.5s)]
*  give them a sense of what it's like to live every day thinking I might not be here in a few moments. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2655.5s)]
*  And I mean, that's just the reality of life for people in Gaza. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2663.5s)]
*  It's going to get much worse. They promised us that. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2668.5s)]
*  So we're going to sit glued to our screens and try to make as much noise as possible. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2671.5s)]
*  And, you know, I'm going to try to obviously go out and protest. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2678.5s)]
*  I'm I'm in France, as you know, and actually, the situation here is is is a bit absurd. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2682.5s)]
*  They've canceled our protests, which was set to happen on Saturday. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2688.5s)]
*  We just found out about that a little bit ago. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2691.5s)]
*  And I saw that the E.I. just published a piece about how they actually also arrested the organizer of the march. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2693.5s)]
*  Yeah. Who you're talking about the French government for our listeners. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2700.5s)]
*  Mm hmm. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2703.5s)]
*  So the organizer of the march was was the leader of a Palestinian solidarity organization, [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2705.5s)]
*  a French man by the name of Bertrand Helbron. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2710.5s)]
*  He was arrested earlier because of his organizing for this march to support Palestine and what's happening right now. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2713.5s)]
*  And I mean, this is not unique to Palestine. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2721.5s)]
*  France right now is dealing with a lot of issues and a very serious crackdown on civil liberties. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2725.5s)]
*  This is really just a continuation of those same repressive policies. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2730.5s)]
*  They, you know, in the last few years, gassed for over a year, the yellow vest protesters, [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2735.5s)]
*  which were primarily a middle class economic movement, just arguing and protesting and demanding that they should have better living condition [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2742.5s)]
*  and that they shouldn't be retired people unable to afford bread at the end of the month and they shouldn't be subject to increases on taxes while the wealthy, [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2752.5s)]
*  of course, are seeing decreases in taxes. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2760.5s)]
*  And they were complaining of wealth transfer and they were complaining of the major gaps between the middle class and the and the extreme upper class. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2762.5s)]
*  So this is not really anything new. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2774.5s)]
*  They gassed all those people. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2777.5s)]
*  They, you know, used heavy military force against those protesters every Saturday for a year. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2779.5s)]
*  If you followed those protests, they they targeted journalists. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2785.5s)]
*  They also used rubber bullets. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2789.5s)]
*  Many people lost their eyes. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2793.5s)]
*  They lost, you know, fingers, things like that. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2794.5s)]
*  And this also comes on the heels of a proposed legislation in France, which is actually still being debated, [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2797.5s)]
*  but has caused a lot of controversy lately to ban the recording and dissemination of images and video of the police. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2805.5s)]
*  So there's a serious attempt right now in this country to really repress civil liberties. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2813.5s)]
*  There's this rush to the right. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2820.5s)]
*  And there's essentially an all out war on democratic principles, you know, everything from freedom of speech. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2822.5s)]
*  You know, we saw a few years ago, France criminalized BDS. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2827.5s)]
*  And then eventually we condemned by the European Court of Human Rights for having criminalized BDS. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2830.5s)]
*  The court said this is a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights, a violation of free speech. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2835.5s)]
*  France didn't care. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2840.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2842.5s)]
*  They went ahead with it anyway. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2843.5s)]
*  There's been other attempts to repress various freedoms like the freedom of religion. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2847.5s)]
*  I mean, you guys have all heard about the hijab bans and things of that nature. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2852.5s)]
*  I won't get into that here. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2856.5s)]
*  But the point is, is that the canceling, the so-called canceling of the march to support Palestine on Saturday, [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2857.5s)]
*  it can really be viewed within the context of this greater crackdown on civil liberties. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2864.5s)]
*  But just so you know, they always cancel the protests and people always show up anyway. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2870.5s)]
*  And basically the canceling of the protest is used as a pretext to use violence. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2874.5s)]
*  So they'll say, oh, well, the protest was illegal. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2879.5s)]
*  So now we can shoot at you, gas you and do all this stuff. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2881.5s)]
*  I was at the protest in 2014 in Paris the last time that Israel committed its military assaults on Gaza. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2885.5s)]
*  And we were treated as criminals from the moment we arrived. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2893.5s)]
*  From the moment we arrived, we were treated as criminals. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2897.5s)]
*  We were caged in. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2899.5s)]
*  There were heavily militarized police on all ends. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2900.5s)]
*  And they started gassing us in the middle. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2904.5s)]
*  And they wouldn't let us escape. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2907.5s)]
*  I mean, this is very typical response of the French police to any sort of social organizing that they find threatening, [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2908.5s)]
*  which really is clich√© or sorry, excuse me. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2917.5s)]
*  It really is sort of ironic because when you understand that the deep history of French organization and social movements, [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2920.5s)]
*  this is supposed to be a national identity for them. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2927.5s)]
*  The idea of resistance and uprising and organization and socialism and things like that. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2932.5s)]
*  But France is and has been for many years now turning away from its roots in those movements and turning very much towards a very scary, extreme right reality. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2938.5s)]
*  Well, Laura, El Borno and Michael Scherzer, you are both the co-hosts of the Palestine Pod. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2952.5s)]
*  And if you want to see more of the Palestine Pod, we will put a link up to the Palestine Pod, but you can find it anywhere where you get your podcasts. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2960.5s)]
*  And yeah, I really encourage our listeners to like and subscribe. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2970.5s)]
*  Steven Saleta, our friend and colleague, was your most recent guest. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2976.5s)]
*  It was a phenomenal episode. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2980.5s)]
*  Did you watch? Oh, I am so glad you watched. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2982.5s)]
*  He's extraordinary. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2984.5s)]
*  But so are you. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2986.5s)]
*  Thank you so much for the work that you're doing and for being with us on the Electronic Intifada podcast. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2987.5s)]
*  Please send our best to your family, Laura. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2993.5s)]
*  And, you know, we just hope that everyone remains safe. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=2997.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3001.5s)]
*  Thank you so much for the work that you all do here. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3003.5s)]
*  It's an honor to be on this podcast. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3005.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3007.5s)]
*  Joining us today from Occupy Jerusalem is Johanna Bakker. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3009.5s)]
*  She's a writer and translator and she's written for the Electronic Intifada. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3013.5s)]
*  Johanna, thank you so much for being with us. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3017.5s)]
*  Can you tell us what the situation looks like outside your front door right now? [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3019.5s)]
*  Hi, thanks for having me. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3025.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3027.5s)]
*  My house is right next to the Aqsa Mosque. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3029.5s)]
*  I live in the African Community Quarter, the African Palestinian Community Quarter, and it's just like 100 meters from the Aqsa Mosque. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3033.5s)]
*  So as you probably know, it's been, you know, a week of just a lot of tension and a lot of clashes and a lot of, you know, tensions are really high. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3041.5s)]
*  And it's not just in the Aqsa, of course. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3053.5s)]
*  I mean, the Old City, Sheikh Zarrah, all over. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3057.5s)]
*  So, yeah, I mean, anyone who's been to Jerusalem will know that Jerusalem is, there's a very heavy Israeli military presence, even when there's, where there are no clashes. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3061.5s)]
*  So it's very different from being in the West Bank. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3073.5s)]
*  So I also have a house in West Bank where I go back and forth. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3077.5s)]
*  So it's very different because you feel that presence wherever you go. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3080.5s)]
*  And so now, when things like this happen, you can see the divide is just like right down the middle. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3085.5s)]
*  There's no, there's nowhere in between. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3091.5s)]
*  You know, it just goes straight down the middle and it's just, it's always very, very combustible. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3093.5s)]
*  I mean, so right now, I mean, people are, their tensions, you know, the tensions are very high, their emotions are high. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3100.5s)]
*  There's a lot of, there's a feeling that people, they're fearless. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3109.5s)]
*  I mean, I've been, I've been to Sheikh Zarrah more than once. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3114.5s)]
*  I mean, I live right there. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3118.5s)]
*  And I can see, and it really is like this uprising or whatever you want to call it. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3122.5s)]
*  It's the youth. I mean, they are just out in the streets. They're tired of this. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3127.5s)]
*  They're, they're, they're just fed up. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3132.5s)]
*  And part of me is very proud as a Palestinian to see this. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3136.5s)]
*  And part of me is fearful. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3141.5s)]
*  And because of, we know what happens when these things happen. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3143.5s)]
*  We know that Gaza always pays the price. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3147.5s)]
*  And that's exactly what's happening now. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3150.5s)]
*  So it's, it's, there's a lot of mixed emotions that I can speak for myself and probably for a lot of people. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3152.5s)]
*  There are a lot of mixed emotions involved right now. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3159.5s)]
*  Can you talk a little bit about being a parent right now, you know, amidst everything that's happening? [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3163.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3171.5s)]
*  And, you know, like I just, the, the, the most horrifying testimonials from Gaza have been pouring in all over social media of children saying goodbye to their parents before they go to bed, for example, and, and parents, you know, not being able to, to, to, to dig into the issues that they have. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3172.5s)]
*  To, to guarantee that they will all wake up in the morning. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3192.5s)]
*  I mean, just the most, you know, unimaginable trauma and fear. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3195.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3202.5s)]
*  Because of Israel's, you know, death machine. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3203.5s)]
*  You're in East Jerusalem, where situation is, you know, continues to be very volatile, where Israeli police and Israeli, you know, settler lynch mobs are threatening Palestinians all over the city and elsewhere inside the West Bank. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3206.5s)]
*  Can you talk about what it's like being a parent? [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3225.5s)]
*  Well, again, I have my son is 21. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3229.5s)]
*  And my daughter is almost 19. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3233.5s)]
*  And, as a parent, the problem with the thing with being a Palestinian, a lot of times is that you also have this, these emotions, where you want to instill in your children to the love of their country, and that, you know, we have this right to defend it, and we have this right to resist and this is exactly what me and their father did for the years. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3237.5s)]
*  And at the same time, as a parent, you have that instinct that you want to protect and that you don't want to happen. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3262.5s)]
*  So there's kind of like this push and pull in terms of when things like this happen. And, you know, and my children also want to be part of it. So you want them to be part of this movement and at the same time you're a prey. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3269.5s)]
*  And that's basically where we are every day. And then sometimes even when they're not even actively part of it, you get pulled into things. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3285.5s)]
*  Just walking down the street in the old city sometimes you get caught in between and even without the thing is with with with being a Palestinian in Eastern Islam, even without, you know, uprisings or whatever or without all of these clashes. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3294.5s)]
*  And I think that's what I like about my son, because he fits you know he's in that demographic he's 21 he's a male. He's, you know, tall he's whatever so he gets stopped all the time he gets harassed. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3314.5s)]
*  So there's, there's never any time when he leaves the house that you think, you know, he may not get arrested or at least you know, pushed around or, and then my daughter as well you know she's, she's very active where it comes to Palestine. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3327.5s)]
*  And so yeah, I have this fear of course but at the same time I think you know, well, everyone else has the same fear and if they don't do it who's going to do it. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3343.5s)]
*  And of course it's nothing compared to what people are going through in Gaza I mean that's just that's just a horror at a whole other level. I mean it's just, and this and the world is, again, we just feel it feels like you know, I don't know if you're familiar [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3356.5s)]
*  with that movie Groundhog Day where you just say things. Yeah, you know we just go over and over and it's hope inshallah at some point, something will break. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3372.5s)]
*  Yeah, I don't feel. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3383.5s)]
*  Yeah. How did it feel earlier this week when to see Palestinians in Gaza and Palestinians inside 48 inside the rest of historic Palestine outside the West Bank and Jerusalem to see Palestinians all over Palestine to express solidarity with you in Jerusalem and the ethnic cleansing [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3386.5s)]
*  campaign that's happening on an ongoing basis. How did that feel of that was amazing. I mean, like for Palestinians, especially Palestinians inside 48 territories, because they have a whole other set of issues. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3409.5s)]
*  Because they're citizens they're citizens of Israel but at the same time they're very discriminated against, and to see that kind of solidarity was really heartwarming for all Palestinians, and then now not just dozens, not just the West Bank not just inside. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3425.5s)]
*  Now you're having Jordanian Palestinians you know rushing to the border, you have them at in Lebanon. So it just also shows, I mean, for me that's also proof that's evidence that Palestinians, and that no matter how long, how long this this conflict continues, [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3443.5s)]
*  the Palestinians will always, you know, adhere to that same cause. And even, I mean, irrespective of our own leadership and all of the mess that they that it's caused the Palestinians when it when push comes to shove. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3461.5s)]
*  You know, this is one cause and they will rise up, you know, and Jerusalem is not just something no matter, no matter what happens at the international level, or again like I said, with, with our leadership, Jerusalem is is what they call you know the red line. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3478.5s)]
*  You know Palestinians just won't have it and that's very heartwarming for us. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3495.5s)]
*  But at the same time you see this crackdown on them, and Palestinians inside the 48 territories. I mean, the lynches and the lynchings and the, even the military the way that they're cracking down on them it's just it's just horrible. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3501.5s)]
*  Yeah, pogroms. Yeah, yeah it is. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3518.5s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3521.5s)]
*  Can you, can you kind of assess the, the situation, you know, around Alexa. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3523.5s)]
*  Just next door to where you live. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3533.5s)]
*  And, you know, how Palestinians have been able to defend, you know, the Dome of the Rock and the Alexa mosque. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3536.5s)]
*  And, you know, the day after aid. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3547.5s)]
*  We're, when we're recording this. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3551.5s)]
*  What does the atmosphere kind of feel like right now, where you are. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3553.5s)]
*  It's all the thing is with being near the outside there's always tension, because like you know that now that they've. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3560.5s)]
*  The settlers are allowed to go in from down gate and so there's always there's always tension there anyway. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3569.5s)]
*  But with this, this new, you know, this, and there's always also, there's always infringement on the little ones big ones so that this is what the media doesn't always pick up or they, they've normalized it. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3576.5s)]
*  So living there you see that day to day. The difference now is that it's at this mass scale. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3594.5s)]
*  And again, you never know when things are going to flare up like the other day, right before the last day of Ramadan was it maybe the day before. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3601.5s)]
*  So, it was just crazy. I mean, Alexa was actually there was literally a literal fire there. And also people were just like in the thousands just chanting and throwing rocks and they were shooting rubber bullets and tear gas. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3610.5s)]
*  And then so like at around 1111 30, I was in the house and everything was common all of a sudden we just hear these like, son grinnies going off the run outside to go see it because my, you know, my kids are outside. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3626.5s)]
*  I mean, special forces, if anybody I mean you, if you're here if you've come here you know that Israel special forces are different than the army. They are just ruthless, and they're just like throwing them inside the inside the neighborhood, and people's [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3640.5s)]
*  legs you know people. I almost everybody I know has gotten him but with a son grenade. So you, you see this you never know when it's going to happen. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3654.5s)]
*  But you kind of like always expect it. And so that's kind of the atmosphere at all times now. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3663.5s)]
*  And again, like I was saying before, it's not like it's something that you know that there's going to be an end to there may be like, you know that it may kind of like recede a little bit for a day, a month, six months, but you always know as long as, as the situation or the [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3670.5s)]
*  conflict remains and there's no settlement that this is going to rise up again and it's just going to be this vicious cycle. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3690.5s)]
*  And that's, that's the unsettling thing. Well, yeah, yeah, the special forces you're referring to is that the border police. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3697.5s)]
*  Yeah, they're called, I don't know what they're called the sound or something in Hebrew. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3705.5s)]
*  They are the border police. I don't quote me on this I'm not sure I think they're an actual special forces from the army. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3711.5s)]
*  They may need a board. They're the ones who they're the ones who wear the helmets with the black, and they have the, you know, [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3721.5s)]
*  the tower logo. I think they may be the border. I'm not sure we call them the special forces, and they're just, they are just brutal. Yeah, yeah. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3730.5s)]
*  They're really brutal. If it's the same force I'm thinking of there, they beat me up once actually really bad decade or more than decades ago yeah I was just filming. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3740.5s)]
*  I mean, that's when I was a volunteer with ISM and I was filming a demonstration in Surefire camp and yeah, they started beating up these kids and they beat me up as well. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3750.5s)]
*  Yeah, that would be them actually. Yeah, they I mean they I mean they are just thugs and I was fine. I've been finding it really interesting thinking about it recently this week of the border police but Israel has no declared border. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3762.5s)]
*  It's true. And also police were in places like Yaffa, which is exactly, you know, and Jerusalem is supposed to be its capital, allegedly, you know, not his border. Right. The border seems to be around Arabs. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3778.5s)]
*  That's exactly it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's the border. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3791.5s)]
*  Oh, so yeah. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3796.5s)]
*  Again, it's just, it's just like, for us. There's always that glimmer of hope that this time something will make a change. You know, but it's just very very frustrating. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3799.5s)]
*  And it's the second time though isn't it we always think that. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3812.5s)]
*  That's the thing but in the back of our minds we know that that that you know the balances of power in the world are not in our favor at this point, including the Arabs, including you know, so, but at the same time it's like so what do you do you just you can't just, you can't just [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3816.5s)]
*  lay down and give up. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3833.5s)]
*  That goes against human nature, not just the Palestinians, you know, if they're going to keep pushing against us pushing pushing pushing, you know, you're gonna you're gonna push back. There's no other way, but the price is always very heavy and Gaza always seems to pay the highest [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3836.5s)]
*  price. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3850.5s)]
*  You know, and that's always the case and look at it now already there's like 120 people in guilt. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3851.5s)]
*  You know, in the course of a few days, and it's just it's just, it's just ridiculous and it's. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3857.5s)]
*  And things have not changed so much, you know, on the world, you know, in the world, or, unfortunately, you know, social media makes a difference I think I think that there's more awareness because of social media, but they know let's be honest, the United [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3864.5s)]
*  States is not going to change overnight. Europeans don't, the Europeans, it's almost like you know the Europeans are too shy. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3881.5s)]
*  Like they'll say the right things or they'll, but they don't they don't have the political will to actually take very strong stances so things have not changed. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3890.5s)]
*  And, but as a Palestinian you just can't you can't you can't give up. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3901.5s)]
*  Can you give us an update on what's been happening in Sheikh Shahra specifically because you know throughout the last four or five days. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3908.5s)]
*  You know everyone has been and rightly so focused on on what's been happening in Gaza, but what is the situation with Sheikh Shahra and, and yeah. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3918.5s)]
*  At this point, yeah, they haven't. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3930.5s)]
*  As far as I know, they haven't. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3933.5s)]
*  They haven't expelled them yet. Right. They're still supposed to you know they're waiting for the court order. But again, that's not a victory that they've postponed it. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3937.5s)]
*  So people are still going on the settlers are involved now. Also you know sometimes settlers they they slash the tires or whatever. So there's still that ongoing, there's still ongoing clashes every night. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3947.5s)]
*  Again, I haven't been there in a few days but I did go there. It's not it's very unsettling very unsettling because like this really come in with. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3959.5s)]
*  First of all, they come in with their horses you know those big big big horses to disperse the people. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3968.5s)]
*  And then these special forces you know the border police come in, and then they have the, the, what is it what is it called the skunk water. Right. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3974.5s)]
*  And that stuff is just horrible. Like people, people even make jokes. You know like the demonstrators make jokes so like you know what, I'll take a rubble bullet but I do not want to get sprayed by this young water. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=3985.5s)]
*  So, that's still ongoing but, but the court order is still pending, but we know what happened. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4000.5s)]
*  We always know I mean it wouldn't be the first time, and we try to change the narrative as well the word evictions is not the right word to use. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4007.5s)]
*  You know they're, they're, they're ethnically cleansing Jerusalem, and they're expelling the forcefully expelling it's not it's not an eviction eviction makes it sound like they didn't pay their rent or whatever. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4014.5s)]
*  And so we know what's happening and I think that the narrative is so important. And this is what's been skewed for so many years. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4027.5s)]
*  Even the word conflict is not, you know, some people are saying oh you know stop the war it's not a war. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4036.5s)]
*  You know it's an aggression it's an occupation, etc, etc. So these are all like different battles that everyone has to fight. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4042.5s)]
*  And I think in that sense social media may help a little bit, but we have to do what we can. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4050.5s)]
*  But you know the sense of solidarity and she is unbelievable. I mean, I don't know if you know Ramadan, people were eating breaking their fast there. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4057.5s)]
*  And the youth have been almost fearless it's just for me. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4067.5s)]
*  I lived through both intifadas. And yes, there was a lot of that as well but in Jerusalem. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4072.5s)]
*  I haven't seen this for a long time. This you know this just, they're just fed up. Yeah. And it just shows every time something like this shows shows how stark the divide is. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4079.5s)]
*  You are also an American. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4096.5s)]
*  And when, when you see the, you know, the like Biden saying yesterday for example that like he didn't think that Israel's use of force was over, over the line or whatever, you know, and you know he basically sentences, you know, thoughts and prayers to, you know, for this to [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4101.5s)]
*  quickly end, you know, he was a complete neutral player in this. And there's a lot funding the Israeli military and sending weapons that are killing children in Gaza right now. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4125.5s)]
*  And then there are politicians who, you know, they say all the right things, you know we shouldn't be, we shouldn't be, you know, helping to kill children and but they're not calling for actual concrete consequences on Israeli policies. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4137.5s)]
*  What, what do you think it would take, you know, for even the most you know so called progressive politicians here in the United States to demand that that the US cut immediately cut all Israel. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4155.5s)]
*  Well, first of all, I think that anyone who looks to Biden, as any kind of like game changer in the house and you know the Palestinians, it's just, you know, sorry, they're just like delusional. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4173.5s)]
*  Yeah, we all know. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4185.5s)]
*  You know the only thing the only reason why people were a little bit happy that Biden went is because it because he followed Trump. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4187.5s)]
*  You know I mean, okay, but the Americans have historically always been even Barack Obama was way better than a lot of other presidents, but in the end, he signed off on $38 billion you know, over the next, you know, so he recently military in 2014. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4194.5s)]
*  Exactly, exactly. So I'm not, you know, I am, I can probably speak for all Palestinians, we're not looking to buy it into changing. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4212.5s)]
*  Now the breath of fresh air within the American public. First of all, the people. There are a lot of Americans who are aware, and who are, you know, I'm trying to raise awareness and change things. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4221.5s)]
*  And you know BDS in the States is pretty alive. There's also the Congress people. I mean, yesterday I read that there were 25 Congress, you know, members of Congress who are calling on Israel to, or on the US to, to at least link funding. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4233.5s)]
*  And I think like to answer your question, I think the only way that policy will change is through funding. It has to be money. There's really no other way and and but I don't see that happening yet. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4254.5s)]
*  I mean, there is a movement within, there are changes within this, you know, the Congress where you are hearing voices. And also, I mean celebrities. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4267.5s)]
*  I have never seen that many celebrities speak out about Palestine and Americans as well. There are always the, you know, a few of them who always speak up, but lately, which is for me it's great. I mean, they're small things. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4279.5s)]
*  But to tell you to tell you that I think that there's going to be any change in US policy towards Palestine in the near future. Look, I don't see that. But, you know, change doesn't happen quickly. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4291.5s)]
*  And I think that the, I think people are the ones who will make those changes, whether the Americans, the Palestinians, the Palestinians need to keep, need to keep raising awareness and need to keep doing what they're doing. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4304.5s)]
*  Maybe up their game a little bit where it comes to leadership and narrative. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4318.5s)]
*  But other than that, you know, I think it all comes down to money. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4325.5s)]
*  No, it's true. It does. Absolutely. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4331.5s)]
*  It's all about the Benjamins. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4334.5s)]
*  Exactly. Well, you can't say that because [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4339.5s)]
*  completely correct tree, she should never have apologized for. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4347.5s)]
*  Absolutely. That's the thing. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4351.5s)]
*  But you know, anybody we know how it is in the States and also I mean in the West in general, but in the States, it's like, there's, I think that one thing that needs to be worked on and I think people are starting to is that you, you do not equate criticism of Israel with anti semitism, you know, you can't, that needs to be something that's starkly clear. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4354.5s)]
*  And I think there are people who are raising awareness, but Israel plays on that all the time. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4376.5s)]
*  Of course they use it. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4381.5s)]
*  You know, they use it big time. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4384.5s)]
*  And I think that that's something for me as a, you know, as a journalist and as a, you know, working with policy meeting narrative is extremely important. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4387.5s)]
*  You know, and it's very important to use the right words and it's very important to write phrases. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4395.5s)]
*  And I think this is something that, you know, they just can't, they can't get away with it and they're starting to change. I have this feeling starting to change. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4400.5s)]
*  But in terms of policy. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4410.5s)]
*  No. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4413.5s)]
*  Unfortunately, I think it's only for us it's going to change anything. Yeah, absolutely. And, and people, you know, consistently pressuring politicians to do the right thing and be on the right side of history. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4415.5s)]
*  Finally, as a journalist as a writer as a translator as someone who's in the streets at ground zero really for for the struggle for Palestinian liberation and against Israeli, you know settler colonialism colonialism. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4429.5s)]
*  What, [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4445.5s)]
*  how do you, you know, it's hard to predict what will happen in even five minutes from now, let alone like 2448 hours but given that you've, you've been living there for so long and have seen, seen many many uprisings. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4449.5s)]
*  How do you think this this current one will go and, and, you know, [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4465.5s)]
*  Yeah, what do you expect to happen. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4472.5s)]
*  Oh yeah, well, I, I'm hoping for at least small victories. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4477.5s)]
*  I'm hoping for a, you know, a cancellation of the, of the expulsions. Okay, I'm hoping that that the bombing of Gaza stops. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4483.5s)]
*  I'm hoping that there's going to you know that they will to to reconstruct it and help the families that I'm not hoping for. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4497.5s)]
*  I mean, I'm not, I don't expect that there's, you know, also going to be liberated overnight. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4506.5s)]
*  At least I'm hoping for these small, these small victories. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4512.5s)]
*  I'm also hoping for at least awareness to be raised, you know, to be raised a little bit more around the world about Palestine. And because that that awareness will eventually lead to more press like you were saying, more pressure on governments more change of policy. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4517.5s)]
*  In the very short term, I'm thinking probably Egypt is going to, I mean, they've already started this mediation in order to, you know, to, but this always happens to ceasefire in terms of Palestinians, I'm hoping that this will also unite us as well. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4536.5s)]
*  And, you know, this whole division, or maybe at some point and between Gaza, the West Bank, Hamas, etc, etc. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4552.5s)]
*  So that's what I'm hoping for for now. I don't like to. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4563.5s)]
*  I don't I don't have any illusions that this is going to, you know, we're going to have a state or whatever. That's a whole other conversation. But yeah, at least that because if they stop this and change that that could be a precedent for other cases and we know they're going to be [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4568.5s)]
*  This is just, you know, this is just a little microcosm of Palestine. So, inshallah, at least that for now. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzkA-VFI2JU&t=4586.5s)]
