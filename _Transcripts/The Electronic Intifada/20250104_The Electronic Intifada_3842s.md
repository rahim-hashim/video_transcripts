Video Description: In a new 83-page report, members of the MIT Coalition for Palestine – made up of 20 different student and faculty groups on campus – are exposing the institutional ties between the elite Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Israeli military. 
With meticulous research, these students trace the money and weapons trail that winds through Israel’s genocide in Gaza, unmasking and confronting MIT’s research, as it describes itself, “to make a better world." 
"MIT laboratories on campus conduct weapons and surveillance research directly sponsored by the Israeli military,” the coalition states. 
"Since at least 2015, MIT laboratories have received millions of dollars from the Israeli Ministry of Defense for projects to develop algorithms that help drone swarms to better pursue escaping targets; to improve underwater surveillance technology; and support military aircraft evade missiles.”
As students and faculty respond to the global call for boycott, divestment and sanctions, and exposing these ties between their university and Israel’s killing machine in Gaza, MIT has enacted draconian tactics of repression against students and faculty.
Prahlad Iyengar, a graduate student in the electrical engineering and computer science department at MIT studying quantum information science, has been organizing with the Coalition for Palestine at MIT since October 2023.
“The world recognizes that this is a genocide,” he tells The Electronic Intifada Podcast.
“MIT even should recognize that this is a genocide. It violates MIT’s own policies to be funding, groups or to be collaborating with an entity that actually, actively is perpetrating a genocide. It’s a violation of its own audit and risk policy because it’s engaged in active human rights violations. And yet, MIT does not apply that standard to Israel.”
Iyengar said that he was suspended by the university who charged him with “harassment and intimidation” because he asked Lockheed Martin recruiters questions about their weapons program at a career fair on campus.

# Exposing ties between MIT and Israel's army, with Prahlad Iyengar and Michel DeGraff
**The Electronic Intifada:** [January 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms)
*  Welcome back to the Electronic Intifada podcast. I'm Nora Barrows-Freedman. In a new 83-page report, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=0.0s)]
*  members of the MIT Coalition for Palestine, made up of 20 different student and faculty groups on [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=7.48s)]

*  Technology and the Israeli military. With meticulous research, these students trace the [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=20.72s)]
*  money and weapons trail that winds through Israel's genocide in Gaza, unmasking MIT's [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=26.88s)]
*  research as it describes itself for the betterment of humanity. As the Coalition outlines in their [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=33.08s)]
*  report, quote, MIT laboratories on campus conduct weapons and surveillance research directly sponsored [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=39.64s)]
*  by the Israeli military. Since at least 2015, MIT laboratories have received millions of dollars [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=46.68s)]

*  machine in Gaza, MIT has enacted draconian tactics of repression against students. Joining us to talk [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=79.4s)]
*  about this report and the ways students are fighting repression at MIT is Prahlad Iyengar, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=87.16000000000001s)]
*  a graduate student in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department at MIT. He's [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=92.60000000000001s)]
*  studying quantum information science. He's been organizing with the Coalition for Palestine at [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=98.76s)]
*  MIT since October 2023. And because of his activism, Prahlad was banned from campus, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=104.32s)]
*  and the administration has begun the process of expulsion. We'll get more into that. Also with us [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=110.32s)]
*  is Michel de Graaff. He's a professor of linguistics at MIT and the director of the MIT Haiti Initiative. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=116.52s)]
*  He says that at the core of his teaching, research, and activism is the belief that language, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=123.24s)]
*  linguistics, and education are essential tools for decolonization and liberation. Thank you [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=128.72s)]
*  both for being with us today on the Electronic and Tefada podcast. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=135.32s)]
*  Thank you for having us. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  Thank you, Nara, for having us. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=140.48s)]
*  Thank you. Well, let's talk about this report. First off, as I mentioned, it's more than 80 [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=143.0s)]
*  pages of meticulous research into the links between the Israeli Ministry of So-called Defense and MIT. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=149.04s)]
*  We know that other Western institutions are heavily involved in research and development of [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=156.35999999999999s)]
*  weapons technology, surveillance technology, et cetera. But what's different about MIT's [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=161.4s)]
*  relationships? How did you trace the money and the research trails here? Let's start with you, Prahlad. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=166.96s)]
*  Certainly. What I think is very different about the complicity at MIT in particular, there's maybe [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=174.56s)]
*  two contrasts to make. The first is a contrast between the calls that we have in the Coalition [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=184.08s)]
*  for Palestine at MIT versus what has been going on at other universities. Because the main cry at [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=189.28s)]
*  other universities has been about divestment, which is extremely important. And I think that's [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=194.72s)]
*  definitely part of the decolonization process and effectively defunding the Zionist entity. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=198.96s)]
*  But MIT actually maintains active research projects which are sponsored by the Israeli [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=205.76s)]
*  Ministry of Defense. So the way we found this out was actually through MIT's vice president or [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=211.6s)]
*  vice provost for finance. They maintain a website where they include their audit documents as well [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  as what's called the Brown Book. And the Brown Book is effectively a catalog of all sponsored [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=226.48s)]
*  research at MIT. So the audit reports actually list all of the sponsors of various projects. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=232.79999999999998s)]
*  And they don't tell you who the project is under, but we can see an example, I think I said an [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=238.96s)]
*  example of what the audit reports look like. And if you pull that up, you can see at the bottom, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=243.76000000000002s)]
*  the Ministry of Defense of Israel is actually mentioned very explicitly here. It's listed [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=250.32s)]
*  under the Department of Defense, which is the primary sponsor. And the direct sponsor is the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=254.72s)]
*  Ministry of Defense of Israel. And you can see there, this is just from 2023, you can see these [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=259.44s)]
*  you can see these various projects that have been sponsored. And I'll just read a couple of the names [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=265.04s)]
*  out, autonomous robotic swarms, distributed coordination and perception. You have core [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=270.32s)]
*  set compression algorithms. You have projects involving multifunctional fiber systems. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=274.96000000000004s)]
*  And these are just some of the projects that were sponsored in the full year of 2023. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=280.24s)]
*  There's been sponsorship of projects since 2015 and actually since 2008, but we have data for [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=284.8s)]
*  the project since 2015. We were able to kind of dig up these projects by looking into the [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=291.6s)]
*  Brownbook, looking into the financial reports. And we found that they were directly sponsored by [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=300.56s)]
*  the Israeli Ministry of Defense. We searched up what that means. And ultimately, it means that the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=305.28s)]
*  Israeli Ministry of Defense has the ability to shape the research goals, shape the deliverables [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=310.08s)]
*  and the directives. And even has early access to these deliverables, including, for example, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=316.64s)]
*  algorithms that are developed during these programs before they get published. So even [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=322.8s)]
*  though a lot of this work is open and publishable, a lot of the deliverables might be tailored and [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=327.84s)]
*  crafted toward specific goals that the Israeli Ministry of Defense has, as well as they might [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=333.68s)]
*  be made available to the Israeli Ministry of Defense before they're actually published [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=338.88s)]
*  and available openly. So this is kind of how we discovered that. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=344.16s)]
*  And Michelle, how have you been involved in this? And what are your reactions to the way [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=349.92s)]
*  that your institution, the elite university of MIT, world renowned institution for research [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=359.6s)]
*  and science and engineering and technology, has been involved in this genocide in Gaza? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=368.64s)]
*  Well, actually, just to follow up on what Palad just explained, when I read this report about [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=377.44s)]
*  science for genocide, one thing that I find striking is the details are careful. The students [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=383.36s)]
*  have been in documenting MIT's engagement in complicity with genocide. And as a language, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=390.56s)]
*  what I find really distressing is on the one hand, you have this report by students [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=398.16s)]
*  that document MIT's engagement in a genocide that's harming thousands and thousands of [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=404.08000000000004s)]
*  Palestinians, mostly children and women. And on the other side, you have Palad who's being accused [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=411.76000000000005s)]
*  of being, quote, a terrorist, who's being accused of causing harm. For example, I wrote a letter of [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=419.28000000000003s)]
*  appeal for Palad's case, where I stressed the fact that he's a student who's protesting against [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=426.96s)]
*  Lockheed Martin coming to campus to recruit students to engage them in this process of [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=434.47999999999996s)]
*  genocide. So they are causing real harm. And then you have the same Lockheed Martin [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=440.0s)]
*  representatives, recruiters, who are accusing Palad of causing them to feel unsafe. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=447.91999999999996s)]
*  And this is what, you know, so I've been doing this seminar this semester at MIT. And the seminar [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=455.04s)]
*  was one of the focuses was looking at the ways in which languages manipulated for these, what I [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=461.12s)]
*  called, what people have called before me, accusations in the mirror, where it's as if [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=466.8s)]
*  every accusation against students, against faculty, against staff that are anti-genocide [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=471.6s)]
*  reveals a confession of what's being talked about. Because obviously, in this case, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=478.08s)]
*  Palad is not a terrorist. Palad cannot cause harm to any of these recruiters sent by a billion [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=484.32s)]
*  dollar company making money out of the data set of Palestinians. But yet, Palad is the one being [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=491.68s)]
*  suspended for so-called creating harm. Now, in my particular case, as a linguist, and actually [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=496.4s)]
*  on December 5th, the date which is very hard to forget because it is the date of when [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=504.0s)]
*  the process of Haiti's being colonized started, December 5th, 1492, when Columbus got lost in [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=509.2s)]
*  Haiti. But it's also the date when we had these hearings in Congress where three presidents were [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=516.0s)]
*  called from UPenn, from Harvard, from MIT. And there was supposed to be hearings about, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=521.28s)]
*  quote unquote, anti-Semitism. But quickly, as a linguist, what I observed was this conflation, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=528.08s)]
*  it's recurrent between Zionism and Judaism. In fact, the very folks, the very Congress people [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=534.48s)]
*  during the hearing, some of them are most rabid anti-Semites, including Stephanie. And what [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=541.76s)]
*  Stephanie did in this hearing was to, not only she used the term anti-fada in a totally erroneous [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=549.36s)]
*  way, she stated that anti-fada means calling for the genocide of the Jews. And she grieved the [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=556.24s)]
*  presidents, how can you allow students to call for anti-fada on your campus? When in fact, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=564.16s)]
*  they started showing evidence that could support this claim that anti-fada means calling for the [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=570.8s)]
*  genocide of the Jews. But recurrently, in the same hearing, she also conflated what Zionism means [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=575.36s)]
*  with what Judaism means. Because whenever she was referring to critique against Israel, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=581.84s)]
*  she was putting it under the category of anti-Semitism. So I felt that as linguists, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=587.6s)]
*  we owe it to our students, we owe it to the world really, to have courses, seminars, materials that [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=593.9200000000001s)]
*  help the public understand these linguistic trumperies where folks in power like Stephanie [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=600.72s)]
*  are using language really as a weapon to aid and abet genocide. So I proposed this course on [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=607.44s)]
*  that very day to my department of linguistics. And I had assumed that linguists would be welcoming [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=615.12s)]
*  this opportunity to make the field, to make linguistics relevant to creating peace and [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=621.6800000000001s)]
*  justice and mutual understanding. And I was shocked that even the title, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=627.7600000000001s)]
*  created concern. Because the first reply I got was that such a title with words like decolonization [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=635.12s)]
*  and liberation caused concern. That's literally what I was told as a response to my course title. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=641.52s)]
*  And then I was told that the course doesn't fit linguistics, which to me was a shock because [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=648.72s)]
*  here's a course that will make linguistics relevant for one of the worst crimes against [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=654.64s)]
*  humanity, if not the worst crime against humanity, a course about the use of language to support [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=658.64s)]
*  genocide. And I was told this is not linguistics. Then I was told that I like expertise to teach [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=663.52s)]
*  that course because it's a course that does not address our core curriculum. When in fact, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=669.6s)]
*  it was proposed as a special topics course. And at MIT, linguistics, the sort of topics courses [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=676.0799999999999s)]
*  are supposed to cover materials outside of the regular curriculum. And then I was told that you [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=682.96s)]
*  cannot teach it because you like expertise. You can teach about Haiti, but you cannot teach about [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=688.0s)]
*  Palestine and Israel, which is the most anti-intellectual, even racist, statement that [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=692.16s)]
*  one could make that because I'm Haitian, because I'm Black, I can only teach about Haiti and not [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=697.04s)]
*  venture into any adjacent areas. When in fact, at MIT in linguistics and elsewhere, seminars [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=701.52s)]
*  are designed to expand knowledge, to build knowledge. So if I don't have expertise, in fact, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=708.64s)]
*  what I want to do is to teach a seminar about it to increase my expertise. You see, so to make a [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=713.28s)]
*  long story short, the course was banned from linguistics. I managed to do it anyway outside [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=717.76s)]
*  of linguistics as a people seminar, a speaker series. And it's been an amazing experience where [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=723.92s)]
*  we've learned so much as a group and with the help of guest speakers coming. Many of them came from [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=729.12s)]
*  Israel, some of them Jewish, many Palestinian scholars. And together, I think we have created [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=735.36s)]
*  indeed expertise that will help us in the future deal with these linguistic trumperies and demystify [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=742.96s)]
*  them. Thanks for that. And yeah, Representative Elise Stefanik, who you mentioned, I think she's [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=749.28s)]
*  being tapped to head the Department of Education under the Trump administration. So we see very [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=758.56s)]
*  clearly how everything works here. And yeah, Prahlad. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=764.8s)]
*  Actually, no, no, I just want to note. So Stefanik has been tapped to be the ambassador of the US to [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=770.16s)]
*  the United Nations. Oh, that's right. That's right. No, he's trying to get rid of the Department of [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=776.88s)]
*  Education. That's right. Yes. Yeah. So that might be even worse actually. That's right. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=781.76s)]
*  That's right. Yeah, perfect. Thanks for that. And, you know, Prahlad, part of the report, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=786.4s)]
*  this MIT Science for Genocide, I'll put it up on the screen again, is not just looking into the [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=797.4399999999999s)]
*  research ties and following the money trail, of course, but it's also, as Michelle was pointing [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=804.16s)]
*  out, really an examination of the language that is used to kind of normalize this kind of, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=810.48s)]
*  you know, institutional relationship between MIT and the Israeli government and its military. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=820.72s)]
*  Can you talk a little bit about that and why it was important for the MIT Coalition for Palestine [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=828.16s)]
*  to also include sections on understanding what genocide is, what Zionism is, the role that [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=838.0s)]
*  Western settler colonialism has in this, and why it's important for MIT to be challenged [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=849.28s)]
*  on these partnerships in that context? Absolutely. I think the first [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=859.8399999999999s)]
*  point that we had in our heads when putting this together was, you know, this is meant to show [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=869.4399999999999s)]
*  MIT's complicity in the ongoing genocide, but not only the ongoing genocide, but the, you know, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=874.8s)]
*  decades-long occupation of Palestine. And with that in mind, we wanted to put together a document [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=880.56s)]
*  that not only described the complicity, but also situated it within the ongoing crimes of settler [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=888.24s)]
*  colonialism, you know, the racist system of Zionism, you know, the internal colonization [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=894.0s)]
*  process within, you know, 48 Palestine, what people refer to as Israel, which has established [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=899.44s)]
*  an apartheid system, right? You know, it's not to say that if, you know, there were equal rights [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=905.28s)]
*  that somehow, you know, the crime of settler occupation and colonialism would be washed away. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=910.88s)]
*  It's not true. In fact, this apartheid system is itself an extension of the settler colonialism [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=916.72s)]
*  and absorption and internal colonization of the Palestinian people. But we wanted to situate, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=922.0s)]
*  you know, MIT's research within, you know, within the context of the first crime, the Nakba, right? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=929.28s)]
*  Within the context of institutional complicity in general with the Israeli entity. And I think [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=935.0400000000001s)]
*  that it was really important to us to be able to highlight that because that is the story of [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=942.64s)]
*  Palestine, right? And there's no other way to see it, right? I mean, if you want to say that MIT's [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=948.88s)]
*  complicit in war crimes and in genocide, well, you know, it's one thing to show its connections [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=954.88s)]
*  to the Israeli military, but also the fact that it supports and it legitimizes the Israeli, you [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=959.92s)]
*  know, military-industrial complex, that it legitimizes even these, you know, these companies [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=965.52s)]
*  that support the Israeli economy. That to me is also a very clear indication of complicity. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=970.08s)]
*  And just to give you an example, there's a company, Elbit Systems, which, you know, I think [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=975.12s)]
*  many people know about Elbit Systems. It's one of the largest. In fact, I think it's the largest [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=980.88s)]
*  weapons manufacturer for the Zionist entity. They produce, I think, about 85% of the drones [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=984.64s)]
*  that have been used in the attack on Ezzah. It turns out that MIT has partnerships with Elbit. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=992.64s)]
*  Not only partnerships, I mean, they visited campus. Elbit Israel visited their Elbit Israel team, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=999.52s)]
*  came to campus, got a, you know, private tour. They are a member of the Industrial Liaison Program, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1004.24s)]
*  which means they pay about $80,000 per year to have special access to, you know, face-to-face [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1009.3599999999999s)]
*  meetings with professors, access to resources. They get, you know, special access to opportunities [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1014.9599999999999s)]
*  for technology patents and funding opportunities, research collaborations, and also, of course, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1020.64s)]
*  students, right, the talent that arrives at MIT. That's perhaps best exemplified by the fact that [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1026.16s)]
*  they used to have an office in Cambridge. Elbit Systems had an office in Cambridge for, I believe, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1032.48s)]
*  for several years, and it was only due to the activism and the steadfastness of comrades in [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1037.6000000000001s)]
*  BDS Boston that it was due to that activism that they were eventually evicted under, you know, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1044.24s)]
*  under pressure from the people of Cambridge. But certainly, you know, more of that stuff needs to [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1051.6s)]
*  happen, and we need to see these companies, you know, shamed and named, and directly, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1056.56s)]
*  they're completely directly exposed. One of the professors who does research with the [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1061.84s)]
*  Israeli Ministry of Defense, Professor Daniela Russe, her projects actually partner with Elbit [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1065.4399999999998s)]
*  Systems. She has a collaborator named Dan Feldman at the University of Haifa. He is very much embedded [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1071.52s)]
*  within the academic military industrial complex in Israel. But further than that, I mean, they have [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1077.6s)]
*  published papers together with a director of AI at Elbit Systems, right, with AI engineers at Elbit [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1084.3999999999999s)]
*  Systems, I should say. So, you know, they have direct collaborations with Elbit Systems. I mean, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1091.12s)]
*  their joint work, the collaborative work that Daniela does, which is funded under the Israeli [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1095.6799999999998s)]
*  Ministry of Defense, that work was presented at Elbit Systems by Dan Feldman. And we have links to [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1100.7199999999998s)]
*  that in the forthcoming op-ed. But, you know, it's so clear to me that MIT continues to sort of wash [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1106.56s)]
*  away the name, the shame of genocide and the shame of militarization by using its own name, right? [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1113.9199999999998s)]
*  And maybe the clearest example of this that came from our campaign was, you know, at the very [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1121.6s)]
*  beginning, you know, around October, November of 2023, there were protests against the Lockheed [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1127.6s)]
*  Martin Misty Israel Seed Fund. This Misty is a program to send students to study abroad. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1133.12s)]
*  But the Lockheed Martin Misty Israel Seed Fund was exactly as it sounds. It was basically a seed [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1139.52s)]
*  fund to send students and faculty and researchers to Israel to work at Lockheed Martin on research [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1144.3999999999999s)]
*  projects. And MIT tried all sorts of stuff to, you know, tamp down this sort of messaging around this [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1150.9599999999998s)]
*  and claimed that it was about green technology. They tried to greenwash it. They also tried to [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1156.56s)]
*  make it seem like these were just academic projects, not at all involved in militarization. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1162.0s)]
*  Of course, Lockheed Martin is, you know, only involved in the militarization, especially in [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1165.76s)]
*  Israel. And, you know, there were protests against that. And eventually we were able to actually get [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1171.28s)]
*  that fund canceled. So the fund was terminated. We learned of that kind of toward the end of the [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1177.68s)]
*  summer and the beginning of the fall semester. And, you know, that's the kind of action that we need [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1182.72s)]
*  to be taking is we need to be ending this level of complicity. But these sorts of projects, they [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1187.76s)]
*  kind of fly under the radar, right? I mean, MIT is a big name. It is a very prestigious institute. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1192.8799999999999s)]
*  And so a lot of companies get a lot of benefit just by associating with MIT. And so, you know, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1199.04s)]
*  documenting that complicity and showing that these companies are engaged in war crimes and that MIT [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1205.44s)]
*  can't use its own image to wash that away, that's really essential, I think, to our goals. And [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1210.0s)]
*  there's a whole section about these companies actually in the research program. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1215.04s)]
*  And as Michelle referenced, the administration has accused you specifically of making Lockheed [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1218.96s)]
*  Martin's representatives unsafe. Can you talk a little bit about that, about what happened when [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1231.36s)]
*  you confronted these representatives from one of the world's largest weapons manufacturers [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1240.32s)]
*  and the administration's response? Absolutely. I mean, I, you know, I even I'm shocked to even [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1247.6s)]
*  find out that this is the way that they responded. But what happened that day was I and many other [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1255.6799999999998s)]
*  students, you know, went to the career fair, and I, of course, registered and scanned in and all [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1261.76s)]
*  that kind of stuff. And I went to the Lockheed Martin booth at some point during the career fair [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1266.56s)]
*  after talking with other recruiters. And I spoke with one of the recruiters about the projects that [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1272.1599999999999s)]
*  Lockheed Martin offers. I was curious, especially to find out what exactly they were trying to [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1277.6s)]
*  recruit MIT students for, you know, because there's so many companies that come to the career fair. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1282.0s)]
*  And a company like Lockheed Martin, which is very much engaged in defense, one would think that MIT [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1286.1599999999999s)]
*  has a responsibility to sort of not coerce its students to work in the military, or to work for [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1291.76s)]
*  military contractors. They should, I mean, students who decide to go that path may decide to do that, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1297.4399999999998s)]
*  but that shouldn't be something that is promoted by the Institute. And I had one conversation with [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1303.12s)]
*  the first recruiter. You know, I asked a lot about the ethics of working in defense and also about [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1308.6399999999999s)]
*  civilian applications. He then directed me to talk to a different recruiter. And I stood in line to [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1314.1599999999999s)]
*  talk to that recruiter. By the end of it, the career fair staff had decided that they were [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1319.28s)]
*  going to move Lockheed Martin into a private room. And they were going to move their recruiters there [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1323.6s)]
*  and they were going to take students one at a time. So I stood outside that room and I stood in line, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1328.6399999999999s)]
*  waiting for my chance to talk to the second recruiter. And I never got that chance. I was [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1333.76s)]
*  just waiting outside in line. I mean, they submitted video evidence against me in my [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1338.6399999999999s)]
*  discipline case. And probably 85% of that video evidence is just me standing outside of a room, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1343.36s)]
*  just on my phone or maybe talking to some people. But the video evidence basically shows that I did [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1350.4799999999998s)]
*  nothing outside the line. But the statements that came from the Lockheed Martin recruiters and the [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1357.1999999999998s)]
*  interviews they did indicate this idea of unsafety, right? They said, well, we had to take an Uber [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1364.0s)]
*  Black back home to our hotel because we were so scared that something was going to happen. Well, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1369.6s)]
*  of course, I never threatened to do anything. I never even attempted to enter the room. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1373.6s)]
*  But they made that claim. They said that they felt unsafe because I was waiting to speak with them. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1377.84s)]
*  Well, I mean, I had been told to speak with them. They claimed that because I was outside and I was [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1382.7199999999998s)]
*  they say that my volume was really loud. None of the video evidence shows that, for example. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1389.76s)]
*  The way I see it, it's a direct attack to sort of suppress the pro-Palestinian voice. I mean, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1394.24s)]
*  I think the actual case has no basis. There's no real evidence. But of course, the evidentiary [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1400.08s)]
*  standard of the Committee on Discipline is what they call a preponderance of the evidence, which [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1406.16s)]
*  means they have to conclude that it's more likely than not that something happened. What that means [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1410.6399999999999s)]
*  in practice is that any former biases that they may have, including identifying me as one of the [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1415.2s)]
*  campus activists, one of the folks who they've seen, whose face they've identified, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1421.84s)]
*  one of the folks who've been profiled by the police and who, you know, who often gets profiled [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1425.52s)]
*  by the police when any protest happens, the fact that they're able to include that bias and allow [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1430.48s)]
*  that to tip it this way and allow it to tip it to the point where they issued a suspension, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1436.1599999999999s)]
*  a disciplinary suspension. So I'm suspended until January of 2026. It's a very clear indication [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1441.04s)]
*  that this process is broken. But also, it's a very clear indication of the Palestine exception [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1448.24s)]
*  within free speech. I mean, there have been protests at MIT, even protests of Lockheed Martin, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1453.52s)]
*  you know, for example, from the folks who have been active in climate justice, etc. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1458.64s)]
*  And they've not garnered this kind of response. This kind of response has only happened because [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1463.68s)]
*  of students raising their voices for Palestine. You know, I'm not discouraged, of course. I'm not [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1468.48s)]
*  going to be dissuaded from Palestine activism. But it certainly does throw a lot of obstacles [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1474.16s)]
*  in the way. And there are other students who are facing also very challenging discipline at the [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1478.8000000000002s)]
*  moment. And, you know, it's we need to do our part to support that so that we can make a sustainable [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1483.76s)]
*  movement. Thank you for that. It's unfortunately, it's not a rare occurrence that this is [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1488.72s)]
*  happening and keeps happening to students all across the country, who are expressing their [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1497.28s)]
*  discomfort with their institutions, you know, financial investments, political investments, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1505.04s)]
*  you know, in these companies or politicians that support this genocide. And of course, [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1513.44s)]
*  on top of the 76 years of colonization of Palestine. Michelle, can you talk about how [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1522.4s)]
*  it looks from your vantage point as a professor, when you see, you know, your colleagues, you know, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1530.0s)]
*  on faculty, you know, using hundreds of thousands of dollars in grants, you know, with the Israeli [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1538.8000000000002s)]
*  military to develop these, you know, these weapons of war. And when you see, you know, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1549.28s)]
*  the administration handling, you know, the protests by students and members of faculty [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1557.12s)]
*  in such a draconian way. So just to echo what I just said, there's a way in which my experience [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1565.52s)]
*  at MIT is almost as a faculty is almost parallel to what Parat describes for his own case, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1574.0s)]
*  in terms of an exception in terms of Palestine. I've been at MIT now for more than 28 years. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1580.4s)]
*  And over the past 28 years, I've often had the opportunity to propose courses having to do with [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1587.92s)]
*  language and social justice. And it's been an issue. So in 2021, at a seminar where we covered [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1594.56s)]
*  communities from Haiti, Jamaica, Trinidad, Mr. Schell, Mauritius, Shetland, Ireland, New Zealand, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1601.6s)]
*  places that I know much less about than I do now about Palestine and Israel. And that was never [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1611.6s)]
*  an issue. It's only when I propose a course that has Palestine and Israel in the title, [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1616.8s)]
*  and also the term colonization that created a so-called concern. And I was [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1623.52s)]
*  really surprised by the approach of entering a field in which I have no expertise. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1629.68s)]
*  Whereas, talking about Shetland or New Zealand, there was no issue there because it's still [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1636.24s)]
*  similar to those expertise. But there's one thing that I find really despairing when it comes to [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1641.68s)]
*  MIT being in such alignment with the genocide is the fact that if you look at MIT's mission statement, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1648.48s)]
*  so the slogan that I keep repeating is that at MIT, we're supposed to practice mind, [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1655.1200000000001s)]
*  hand, heart, work to make the world better, for a better world. And how can we have such a slogan? [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1662.3200000000002s)]
*  And how can we, two years ago, around this issue of deep values for higher education, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1671.5200000000002s)]
*  there was a long series of faculty meetings about the importance of academic freedom, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1679.44s)]
*  academic expression. And interestingly, this was at a time when there was a pushback around [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1684.16s)]
*  faculty wanted to be free to talk about issues that I would consider as a black person quite [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1691.3600000000001s)]
*  racist. And when faculty had a faculty meeting, they said that he could not teach well, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1698.0800000000002s)]
*  he could not be a good teacher if he had to worry about his students' background because he might [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1704.0800000000002s)]
*  be too sensitive and he would feel too hampered in his teaching. And I had a colleague come to me [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1708.64s)]
*  and say, well, you know, we should, Mia expressed concern that in fact, we need to care about our [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1715.3600000000001s)]
*  students' feelings and what they're coming from because that's what makes us good teachers when [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1720.4s)]
*  we have empathy. And one of my linguistic colleagues came to me in my office afterwards and said, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1723.5200000000002s)]
*  well, you know, as scholars, we need to promote absolute free speech. The only way to combat [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1728.88s)]
*  that harmful speech is to have more speech. In fact, the very statement that MIT came up after [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1736.32s)]
*  this long series of meetings is one where it's very clearly that MIT has to allow any kind of [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1742.8799999999999s)]
*  speech, including speech that might be harmful to some groups. It says so explicitly that MIT has [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1749.1999999999998s)]
*  to allow even speech that might be harmful to some groups. And in this particular case, we have [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1756.7199999999998s)]
*  students, we have faculty whose speech are being repressed. And at the same time, you have the [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1762.8799999999999s)]
*  same administration that's saying that we have to allow research with the Israel Ministry of Defense [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1769.9199999999998s)]
*  because we have to accept that faculty have the right to academic freedom, you see. And our own [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1776.8799999999999s)]
*  president, Corn Blues, described these collaborations as being vibrant. That's the term she used, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1783.44s)]
*  literally. She considers those collaborations between MIT faculty and Israel as vibrant. And [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1789.52s)]
*  then she refers to the importance of academic freedom. So clearly what you see here is beyond [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1796.24s)]
*  face of exception. It's a set of double standards that I find fairly cruel, cruel because [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1802.4s)]
*  allow academic freedom for research that participates in the genocide while repressing [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1810.56s)]
*  free speech for students and faculty who are protesting genocide is, you know, and then [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1816.16s)]
*  just last month we heard at a faculty meeting, one of our leaders at MIT say that we better find ways [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1824.16s)]
*  for MIT to help make the new administration make America great. So that is that how can we [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1832.48s)]
*  adjust our priorities in order to make sure that Washington lacks MIT so we can keep the federal [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1841.2s)]
*  dollars coming in. And when I hear that, it's again extremely concerned because the new [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1848.0s)]
*  administration coming in in January is clearly anti-education. In fact, Trump wanted to even get [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1853.6000000000001s)]
*  rid of the development of education. And what does it mean now for MIT as a leader in higher education [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1859.04s)]
*  wanting to help the new administration make America great, given that what's going to be [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1865.68s)]
*  making America great is getting rid of higher education, getting rid of encourage into different [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1871.68s)]
*  ways of seeing the world. You see, so as a faculty at MIT, I'm extremely concerned by the [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1880.16s)]
*  reason which our administration is obeying even before being issued the orders. And the orders are [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1885.92s)]
*  clearly going in the fastest direction. Indeed, indeed they are. How has the report and this, [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1891.6s)]
*  you know, enormous body of research that the coalition has put together, how has it been [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1903.52s)]
*  received both by students and faculty on campus? Is MIT's relationship with Israel generally popular? [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1908.24s)]
*  Are most students and faculty on board with this or what has been the response? [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1915.28s)]
*  So I can speak, I mean, directly to that point about whether it's popular. I mean, we've now had [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1922.24s)]
*  three votes among various bodies. Last year we had a vote among the Undergraduate Association, [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1929.28s)]
*  which voted for the end of this complicity, specifically these research projects. We had [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1935.36s)]
*  a vote in the Graduate Student Union, which went the same way and asked for these projects to be [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1939.6799999999998s)]
*  ended. And this is, of course, the graduate student body that represents graduate students. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1944.8799999999999s)]
*  And of course, the research is done by graduate students, right? So it's something that I think [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1949.68s)]
*  is very popular among that body. And then we also had this year the Graduate Student Council vote, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1953.44s)]
*  and very clearly vote to condemn the ongoing complicity with the Israeli Ministry of Defense [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1960.0800000000002s)]
*  and also ask that these contracts be cut. You know, all of these indications show that [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1966.4s)]
*  from the student body perspective, these contracts are extremely unpopular. They represent very, [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1973.8400000000001s)]
*  very small amount, a very small amount of the total research done at MIT. I think the maximum [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1978.64s)]
*  that they represent for any one professor is maybe 4% of their total grant money. And, you know, [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1984.0s)]
*  that might sound like a large amount, but it really is not, right? Especially at an institute [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1991.2s)]
*  like MIT, where we get a whole lot of money for a whole lot of research. But, you know, overall, [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=1995.2s)]
*  for the entirety of MIT's research body, this comprises maybe 0.1% or so of the total amount [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2001.1200000000001s)]
*  of research money that we get. And yet MIT is unwilling to cut it. I also kind of want to draw [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2007.76s)]
*  a couple parallels. I mean, you know, a few years ago, there was the murder of journalist Jamal [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2014.0s)]
*  Khashoggi in Saudi Arabia. And as a response to that assassination, the MIT faculty and the MIT [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2020.48s)]
*  students came together to basically vote to divest from Aramco. Aramco is a Saudi state-owned company [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2029.68s)]
*  and, you know, it basically was involved in MIT's energy initiative. There were a bunch of projects [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2038.32s)]
*  partnered with Aramco. And because MIT decided to unilaterally cut ties with Saudi Arabia, [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2044.8799999999999s)]
*  especially the Saudi Arabian government, the contracts with Aramco were cut. And there was a [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2051.92s)]
*  transitional period. There was a period where the work should be transitioned to some other funding [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2056.0s)]
*  source. And that's exactly what we're asking to happen with the Israeli Ministry of Defense, [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2061.52s)]
*  right? That's exactly our same call. But MIT is not willing to do this despite this level of [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2065.68s)]
*  pressure. I mention this because Saudi Arabia has been the case for some time now, a longstanding [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2071.52s)]
*  ally of the United States, right? It's something where, you know, even if you might say, well, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2078.7999999999997s)]
*  MIT is not going to go against US foreign policy, well, there's a case where they did. There's a [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2083.2s)]
*  case where they really did try to have a backbone and speak up against the murder of a journalist. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2086.8799999999997s)]
*  Here in Palestine, we've had hundreds of journalists murdered. We've had them targeted, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2093.52s)]
*  specifically their families have been targeted, right? The people of Palestine are under siege. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2098.32s)]
*  They are not getting access to food, to medicine, to water. There was just now, I think there was a [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2103.12s)]
*  report from the Human Rights Watch, I think just today or yesterday that came out, about specifically [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2110.24s)]
*  the lack of access to water. Amnesty International has now come out and condemned. And of course, [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2115.68s)]
*  that's not to give legitimacy to these institutions that have taken, have dragged their feet and allowed [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2121.12s)]
*  a genocide to occur for months on end, for over a year, without any statements against it. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2125.2000000000003s)]
*  But it does show you that on the whole, the world recognizes that this is a genocide. MIT even should [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2132.48s)]
*  recognize that this is a genocide. It violates MIT's own policies to be funding groups that, [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2138.6400000000003s)]
*  or to be collaborating with an entity that actually actively is perpetrating a genocide. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2145.12s)]
*  It's a violation of its own audit and risk policy, because it's engaged in inactive human [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2150.08s)]
*  rights violations. And yet MIT does not apply that standard to Israel. It applied that standard to [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2156.3199999999997s)]
*  Saudi Arabia. It applies that standard to Russia when it cut the Skoltech program, which was a [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2162.24s)]
*  partnership between MIT and Skoltech, which is a Russian university, after the invasion of Ukraine. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2167.2s)]
*  And MIT now, MIT is also scrutinizing its own relationship with China. At the same time, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2173.36s)]
*  there's an active genocide going on, and MIT has not done anything to scrutinize this relationship [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2179.28s)]
*  with Israel. This to me is the strongest example of a double standard. Every one of our peer [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2183.6000000000004s)]
*  institutions in Riza has been bombed. Every single university has been bombed. Not a single [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2188.7200000000003s)]
*  university is in session. Not a single university has classes. Many, many professors, dozens of [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2193.1200000000003s)]
*  professors have been murdered. Dozens of students, hundreds of students, in reality, have been [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2197.44s)]
*  murdered. Just the other day, I think just two days ago or yesterday, we learned of two students [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2202.7200000000003s)]
*  who were supposed to be going to start their PhDs in Ottawa, or sorry, in Waterloo, perhaps. And [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2209.2000000000003s)]
*  they were murdered. They were killed by an Israeli airstrike. MIT has not at all embraced [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2214.88s)]
*  its values of education, its values of academic freedom. What's the most unfree thing? It's to [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2221.52s)]
*  have to live under a genocide and to not be able to access your education because of that genocide. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2229.28s)]
*  It's the exact antithesis to academic freedom. So it's very clear that it's a very unpopular [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2233.92s)]
*  thing for MIT to be hanging on to these ties. At the same time, the administration is facing [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2241.12s)]
*  pressures from their legal counsel because of, as Michelle mentioned, the subpoena from Congress [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2246.4s)]
*  and the possibility of the right-wing government coming at them. There's obviously a lot of [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2251.6s)]
*  influence from big donors and from Zionist donors as well. There's a lot of pressure also just in [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2255.76s)]
*  the public to put pressure against the coalition for Palestine. At the same time, there's [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2262.96s)]
*  overwhelmingly more pressure from the community against MIT's ties to the Israeli military. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2268.88s)]
*  There was a resolution from a couple of city councilors, two city councilors signed on, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2275.12s)]
*  condemning MIT's repression against students and saying that MIT should not be taking this money. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2281.12s)]
*  So I think it's an overwhelmingly unpopular thing overall for them to hold on to this. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2286.7200000000003s)]
*  At the same time, I don't think that that is what has been driving MIT's decision-making. I think [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2293.52s)]
*  that decision-making is driven by their bottom line, which is why it's important to exact a cost [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2298.6400000000003s)]
*  at the Institute and to make it very clear that we will stand in the way. And that's exactly what [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2303.84s)]
*  I advocated for in my piece on pacifism, for which I was banned from campus. And I'm still [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2310.56s)]
*  banned from campus. That's exactly what the students did when we created the Scientists [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2315.76s)]
*  Against Genocide Encampment. We exacted a cost. We stood in the way. We made it very clear to [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2321.6000000000004s)]
*  everybody on campus that MIT is complicit in genocide. And it cannot erase that stain from [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2327.36s)]
*  its image. And our hope is that this primer, this research primer, is effectively a testament to [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2334.48s)]
*  that and a document to that. And it will be presented, part of it at least, will be presented [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2339.5200000000004s)]
*  hopefully at the next United Nations convening of the discussing the ongoing occupation of the [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2343.92s)]
*  Palestinian territories. We're hoping that it will be presented there because we did submit it. And [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2351.44s)]
*  we're hoping to see MIT's reputation fall because of that. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2356.32s)]
*  You mentioned a piece that you wrote, an essay that you wrote, that the administration has [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2361.28s)]
*  focused on in terms of trying to expel you. First, you've been banned, as you said, [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2368.7999999999997s)]
*  until January 2026 from campus and from taking classes. They're working on expulsion. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2376.16s)]
*  Talk about what you talked about in your piece. We'll also put a link in the show notes to it so [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2382.48s)]
*  that our viewers and listeners can read it for themselves. Talk about what that piece was about [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2388.16s)]
*  and the specific focus that the administration has had in terms of using it against you. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2396.56s)]
*  Sure. So the piece is entitled On Passivism. It appeared first in the Written Revolution zine, [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2404.2400000000002s)]
*  which is actually a zine that I helped found along with a few other co-founders [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2410.96s)]
*  who are now my co-editors on the zine. And the article was basically about analyzing the role [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2415.2000000000003s)]
*  of pacifism within liberation movements. It builds a lot off of Ward Churchill's excellent essay, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2423.68s)]
*  Pacifism as Pathology, which I highly encourage people to read. It's very, very influential and [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2430.96s)]
*  extremely influential specifically for this piece. But it builds off that and critiques the role of [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2436.16s)]
*  pacifism, especially strategic pacifism, within these liberation movements. The distinction that [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2443.6s)]
*  I make here is between strategic pacifism or strategic choices, which are generally founded on [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2449.84s)]
*  fundamental commitments versus tactical choices, which may sometimes conflict with an overall [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2456.08s)]
*  strategy or may not perfectly align, but which are chosen given the context of the moment. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2461.44s)]
*  And my argument is that strategic pacifism is effectively ceding power to the state. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2466.96s)]
*  The state is not a pacifist entity. The state is willing to use violence. The state is willing to [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2472.6400000000003s)]
*  brutally arrest students as they've done on our campus, as well as many other campuses, as well as [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2476.72s)]
*  just community members, right? People who are not students have been brutally arrested. The state is [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2481.3599999999997s)]
*  willing to use its carceral system to punish all forms of dissent and to shut down any form of [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2485.9199999999996s)]
*  community organizing for their own welfare. None of these are pacifist tactics. None of them get [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2492.3199999999997s)]
*  called violent, of course, in the mainstream media, but they are all inherently violent. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2497.7599999999998s)]
*  So to me, strategic commitment to pacifism, meaning a commitment on a fundamental commitment [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2502.8s)]
*  to pacifism, let's say, is a mistake because it does cede power. It says that the state is allowed [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2509.52s)]
*  to harm me. The state is allowed to enact violence on me, and I will not have the right to defend [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2515.2000000000003s)]
*  myself. But the types of actions that qualify as non-pacifist actions don't necessarily have [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2519.52s)]
*  to be violent actions. What I call tactical pacifism is not necessarily the strategic [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2527.92s)]
*  commitment to pacifism, but a tactical choice made under the material conditions that one finds [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2534.2400000000002s)]
*  oneself in. For example, it is really hard in a militarized, given a militarized police force, [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2539.6s)]
*  given the level of regression and surveillance that we face on Turtle Island, it is really difficult [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2544.88s)]
*  to actually mount resistance, like armed resistance, for example, against the government. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2552.2400000000002s)]
*  It might not be advisable, and so that is a tactical choice. There are also other tactical [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2557.12s)]
*  choices that people make about pacifist-type actions. But they don't necessarily stem from a [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2560.8s)]
*  strategic commitment. I think a great example of what I was truly calling for, and really, [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2567.12s)]
*  I mean, at the end of the article, I make this call about mutual aid and connecting with the [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2573.2799999999997s)]
*  community. The reason that I consider that to be an explicitly non-pacifist action is because [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2577.12s)]
*  mutual aid effectively undermines this control that the state has. Mutual aid is ultimately the [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2584.16s)]
*  way that we say the state does not have power over our bodies. The state does not have power [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2590.16s)]
*  over our communities. We will create what we need for our communities. Various groups have [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2594.3999999999996s)]
*  attempted this, from the FALN to the Black Panthers, who created their free breakfast program, [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2599.7599999999998s)]
*  free lunches as well. They created the people's hospitals and healthcare clinics. They created [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2604.3999999999996s)]
*  education systems, et cetera. These were all made so that they could take care of the needs [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2611.2s)]
*  of the community. But what did they also do? They also created community self-defense systems, [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2616.48s)]
*  because they realized that the police force was a force that was a threat to their own community, [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2620.24s)]
*  a force that was willing to use violence to oppress them. I think that committing to mutual [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2625.2799999999997s)]
*  aid, to really caring about the community, is effectively, it can never be strategically [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2630.8799999999997s)]
*  pacifist. You can never say to your community, I actually care about you, but you don't have the [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2637.12s)]
*  right to defend yourselves. But it can be tactically pacifist. What I really called for was a shift from [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2641.04s)]
*  strategic pacifism to this notion of tactical pacifism within the umbrella of mutual aid. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2647.04s)]
*  The reason I called for that is because there's a lot of actions that happen that are, for example, [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2654.56s)]
*  rallies. Rallies that happen in parks or around city halls. To me, a lot of that doesn't seem [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2658.56s)]
*  to be effective. It doesn't actually cause any material change. It doesn't necessarily get [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2663.84s)]
*  any demands met. The reason for that is it's sort of baked into the system, especially with [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2668.96s)]
*  actions that involve performative arrests. I was arrested, for example, at the encampment last year. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2673.84s)]
*  I feel that in some part it was baked into the system, because I ended up without any official [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2680.56s)]
*  charges on my record. I was given a very light slap on the wrist, effectively. But there are [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2687.2000000000003s)]
*  community members, including somebody who I met when I was in holding, who don't have that luxury, [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2693.76s)]
*  whose very existence is defined as a threat and therefore is met with violence by the state. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2701.36s)]
*  They don't have the luxury of having their transgressions being baked within the system. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2706.1600000000003s)]
*  It's a betrayal of our community to treat things like that. For me, my call was mainly about [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2712.1600000000003s)]
*  adopting or switching to this tactical pacifist stance within an umbrella of mutual aid and [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2719.92s)]
*  understanding how to connect to the community. MIT, meanwhile, has taken the article entirely [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2725.44s)]
*  out of context. There's an explicit conversation that I had with one of the folks on the Free [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2730.32s)]
*  Expression Committee said that my article effectively embraces terrorism. The reason [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2736.32s)]
*  is because at the beginning of the article I defend the right of occupied people to resist [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2741.52s)]
*  their occupation, also by armed means. I also included a poster from the historic poster from [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2746.0s)]
*  the PFLP, which was connecting, really, was showing the connection between groups like the [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2752.8s)]
*  resistance groups like the PFLP and land back initiatives on Turtle Island and throughout the [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2758.96s)]
*  world, because that's really what the poster was about. But because it was a poster from the PFLP [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2765.68s)]
*  and it bears their logo and because I use terms like wreaking havoc, I was told that wreaking [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2770.72s)]
*  havoc is explicitly a terrorist tactic. My response to that is that wreaking havoc is also [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2775.12s)]
*  the tactic of every two-year-old I've ever met. So it blows my mind that that's the basis of their [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2779.6s)]
*  repression. But at the same time, they have actually enacted already the stages toward expulsion. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2787.52s)]
*  They've already suspended me for harassment and intimidation of Lockheed Martin recruiters. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2794.24s)]
*  And they told me that if I get those charges again, then they will heavily consider expulsion. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2798.7999999999997s)]
*  And now they have another case lined up for me in February or early March that will try me, [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2803.92s)]
*  again, put me on trial for that exact article. And I've again been accused of harassment and [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2809.84s)]
*  intimidation. This time, I have no idea how I could have harassed and intimidated anybody. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2814.96s)]
*  There's not even a person who I can attribute this to because they've kind of hidden it behind [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2819.44s)]
*  anonymity. They've also, you know, I don't mention anybody in the article, of course. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2824.96s)]
*  But those are the charges that I face. And I think it's so clearly a crackdown on free speech [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2829.76s)]
*  that I worry that it's basically going to result in a chilling of, you know, the pro-Palestine [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2836.0s)]
*  movement. And I've been very glad to see that it actually hasn't done the opposite, [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2840.8s)]
*  as one might expect. It's actually caused a lot of people to read the article. It's caused a lot [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2844.96s)]
*  of people to rise up and say, we won't stand for a student being subject to this level of repression [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2848.6400000000003s)]
*  just for writing his view. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2854.48s)]
*  I mean, Michelle, it must just spin your head around, you know, as a tenured linguist, [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2859.28s)]
*  as someone who has studied the impact of language and speech in the context of [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2868.0s)]
*  methods of decolonization, methods of liberation, methods of Indigenous struggle, [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2876.48s)]
*  you know, against settler colonialism. You know, you mentioned this at the beginning, [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2883.6s)]
*  but maybe talk a little bit more about what comes up for you when you hear Prallad, [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2889.52s)]
*  you know, talk about being, his words being taken out of context and weaponized against him [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2896.32s)]
*  in this, you know, I mean, he's repeating what the United Nations has ratified over and over again [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2905.2s)]
*  in terms of the rights of Indigenous people to use any means necessary to resist. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2911.52s)]
*  Absolutely. Absolutely. You know, in fact, as I have told Prallad that a couple of times already, [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2915.52s)]
*  that I find his essay, no one has to agree completely with what Prallad puts in his essay, [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2922.4799999999996s)]
*  but that's exactly the goal of any scholar presenting the views to the world. If you [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2927.3599999999997s)]
*  disagree, you can have a reason, argument, you present your data, your analysis, and let's debate. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2933.52s)]
*  So in fact, I've told Prallad that I'm teaching next semester, I'm doing two courses. One is called [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2938.48s)]
*  Creole Languages and Caricament Identities, and the other course is called, which I co-teach [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2945.04s)]
*  with my colleague, Fox Harrow, is called Black Matters, where we look at African diaspora throughout [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2949.36s)]
*  the world. And I find Prallad's essay so inspiring. Why? Because, actually, when you think of the [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2954.88s)]
*  repression against it, because coming from Haiti, in fact, what I did after the essay came under so [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2961.84s)]
*  much repression, there is a culture that I quite like, actually, because it so much summarizes [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2967.6800000000003s)]
*  my take as a Haitian when I hear Prallad [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2974.8s)]
*  defend why it's so important that we don't just resign ourselves to be pacifists when we're under [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2978.5600000000004s)]
*  major brutal attacks by forces like in the case of Haiti, it was the French, in the case of [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2983.92s)]
*  Israel, and in the case of the students, it's the police, for example. So there is a culture that [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2990.7200000000003s)]
*  goes back to 1791, and you have Desalines, who was our founding father in Haiti, talking to [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=2995.36s)]
*  Ouachambeau. Ouachambeau was one of the cruelest French generals that were sent to Haiti to [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3001.92s)]
*  combat the Africans fighting for their freedom. And actually, thinking of the current discourse [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3008.8s)]
*  about Haitians by Trump during the campaign, when Trump accused Haitians of eating pets, [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3013.52s)]
*  but actually the French, when they sent Ouachambeau to fight against the Africans, [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3020.08s)]
*  they brought dogs to go after my ancestors. My ancestors were hunted by dogs who would eat them. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3025.36s)]
*  But this cartoon shows Desalines fighting for his freedom, asking Ouachambeau, the cruel French [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3035.68s)]
*  general, please, will you be nice enough to reward us our freedom? And then the cartoon says [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3042.32s)]
*  Ouachambeau was so nice that he immediately liberated those Africans, was being so reasonable, [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3050.56s)]
*  asking for their freedom. So obviously, this is not what happened. Haiti would have never been [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3056.88s)]
*  freed if we had been bound by pacifism. So as a Haitian, I totally understand Pilar's argument [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3060.88s)]
*  that you cannot give the monopoly of violence to your oppressors. But from a larger perspective, [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3068.0s)]
*  what you see happening, both under the case of Trump, even the case of his opponent, [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3075.84s)]
*  Kamala Harris, and even in the case of MIT, is this constant pressure to erase history. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3081.92s)]
*  And so actually, as part of my seminar, where a student presents a project where she analyses [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3088.16s)]
*  the discourse of MIT leadership, and what she shows there is that it contains all the ingredients [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3096.48s)]
*  for rising fascism. Because one of the ingredients for that is that certain people are deemed [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3102.88s)]
*  disposable, and other people are deemed non-disposable. And the way you study it is to see [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3109.36s)]
*  how leadership talks about these different groups. So in the case of fascism in Germany, [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3115.2000000000003s)]
*  it was very clear that Hitler considered the Jews as disposable. He called them [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3120.96s)]
*  vermin. He used the worst words for them. And if you look at the speech of, say, Trump, [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3125.44s)]
*  or the speech even of our leaders at MIT, the way they talk about Palestinian lives versus [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3131.6s)]
*  Israeli Jewish lives, there's a huge contrast. So in fact, the first time I got into, [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3138.64s)]
*  I would call it good trouble at MIT was back in November. And I was responding at a faculty meeting [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3145.92s)]
*  about a leadership, Conbluth. She proposed this group that was going to work against [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3152.4s)]
*  hatred on campus. That was the idea. But the focus was not just on all hatred, because just [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3163.8399999999997s)]
*  on hatred towards Jews. When in fact, at that very moment at MIT, there were lots of students [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3169.7599999999998s)]
*  supporting Palestine who were victims of hatred from various groups, including the [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3175.52s)]
*  pro-Israeli students and the pro-Israeli faculty. So I stood up at the faculty meeting and said, [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3181.2s)]
*  I'm very disturbed by your proposal to look at hatred on campus that focuses only on just one [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3187.12s)]
*  group. And why not look at all kinds of hatred? And at that moment at the faculty meeting, [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3191.52s)]
*  I was shouted at by another faculty who called me something like liar, and folks said, shut up, [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3196.64s)]
*  at an MIT faculty meeting. Now looking at language, just recently, in fact, going back now to the [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3204.24s)]
*  context of protests against MIT's computing genocide, when there was this protest at CSAIL, [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3210.16s)]
*  and when there were articles written about this professor at CSAIL working with Israeli Ministry [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3218.3199999999997s)]
*  of Defense, we got this letter from Congress complaining that there is a lack of civility, [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3225.6s)]
*  there is a lack of politeness. But in my particular case, I was insulted at the [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3233.92s)]
*  faculty meeting in public for telling the truth about Palestine. And there was no statement made [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3239.92s)]
*  about lack of civility, lack of politeness. But in this particular case, where the students are [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3247.04s)]
*  protesting an actual complexity with genocide, now there is a complaint about lack of civility. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3253.44s)]
*  So you see, there again, we come back to this issue of the world standards. But what it tells us is [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3259.36s)]
*  is again, certain lies are viewed more valuable than others. At the same time, there's also this [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3264.96s)]
*  constant erasure of history. In the case of my course, for example, one reason, in fact, [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3270.08s)]
*  perhaps this is the initial reason why it created concern, is because I had the leadership of my [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3276.56s)]
*  department tells me that I should not be using terms like colonial in the context of Israel. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3282.8s)]
*  That is that Israel cannot be viewed as colonial. Why? Because there was no colonial base in the [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3288.8s)]
*  creation of Israel. And in fact, my colleague was, we eventually created this committee to review [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3296.7200000000003s)]
*  and reject my course. He said, well, look, look at Algeria. In Algeria, the French were colonial [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3302.4s)]
*  because they had France as a base. But in the case of Israel, there was no such base for the [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3308.16s)]
*  Zionist project. And this is someone who knows about semantics. And again, I find that we [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3314.72s)]
*  such a spectacular erasure of history that support a fascist approach to education. Because if you go [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3319.92s)]
*  and look at the original source, if you read, for example, Peter Herzl, which maybe should be called [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3326.3999999999996s)]
*  the foundational document about Zionism, Trulka, Jabotinsky, they're all very clear that it was a [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3331.44s)]
*  colonial movement. Herzl even asked Rhodes, Rhodes of Rhodesia, to come help do in Asia Minor, [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3338.08s)]
*  what Rhodes had done in Africa, the colonial project. Jabotinsky was clear that it was a [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3346.4s)]
*  colonial project. And they were also clear who were the indigenous because alongside the view [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3352.08s)]
*  that Israel could not be colonial, that it was a return to the homeland. But what they forget is [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3357.44s)]
*  that both Herzl and Jabotinsky, they recognize that the indigenous people were Palestinians. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3363.6s)]
*  In fact, it's clear it's black and white on paper. So again, history keeps being erased. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3370.48s)]
*  And I realize that this is probably why my course became such a threat. And it had to be banned [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3378.72s)]
*  by an institution that seems to value certain lies over others. Again, going back to the term [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3384.64s)]
*  of fascism, which is by definition, creating hierarchies across different grades of humanity. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3390.88s)]
*  You see, so I really feel that what the students are doing to basically shine a light on the true [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3398.0s)]
*  history of the region and also fight for justice for all is remarkable. So again, I'm very thankful [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3406.1600000000003s)]
*  for the chance that voice of you here. So thank you, Nora. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3414.48s)]
*  Yeah, no, thank you. Prahlad, in the last few minutes, talk about the coalition, [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3419.12s)]
*  talk about where this movement goes next. Even if you're expelled, are you gonna [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3430.0s)]
*  fade into the shadows or are you gonna keep fighting? What comes next? [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3436.56s)]
*  Certainly, what comes next is, it's not entirely up to me for sure. That's why we have a movement. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3441.6s)]
*  But I do think, you know, what comes next is we need to continue to press on these ties. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3448.56s)]
*  We need to continue to press against the complicity. We need to continue uncovering [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3454.4s)]
*  more information. I mean, there was some information that we had, you know, that's [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3458.48s)]
*  not in the primer that appears in the op-ed, because we discovered it as we were doing further [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3462.72s)]
*  research into the complicity of a specific professor. And so I think that's why we have [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3466.56s)]
*  you know, these ties to Elbit systems and that kind of thing. We need to continue doing that. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3472.24s)]
*  And we need to continue speaking truth to power. I certainly hope that, you know, [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3476.8s)]
*  eventually we can recognize that a professor doing, you know, work on algorithms for drone [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3482.0s)]
*  technology, which allows them to track moving targets and that kind of thing, or a professor [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3487.28s)]
*  who does work for the Israeli Ministry of Defense in algorithms for compression algorithms so that [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3493.28s)]
*  they can run machine learning on drones to do facial recognition and identification. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3498.72s)]
*  I certainly hope that that will be branded as war technology, that people understand that only in [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3503.3599999999997s)]
*  the context of war. It has been clear, you know, ever since the beginning of this accelerated [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3509.6s)]
*  phase of genocide, but even before then, throughout the Obama administration, for example, [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3513.8399999999997s)]
*  that the face of war was changing to drones. And I think, you know, this has done two things. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3517.68s)]
*  One, it has made war much more devastating. It has made it much more effective at killing, [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3524.32s)]
*  you know, hundreds, thousands, you know, even up to the millions of innocent people. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3530.4s)]
*  But also, you know, this focus on drone technology during the nascent stage of drone technology in [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3535.36s)]
*  the first place means that it has now tied the academic complex very closely with the military [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3543.28s)]
*  complex. I mean, the ability to move from algorithm to deployment is much faster than for, [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3548.56s)]
*  you know, hardware technology. The ability to scale that up to deployment and to run [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3555.52s)]
*  fast iterations to figure out what can be deployed and what can't. And, you know, to work on new [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3561.6s)]
*  types of algorithms and compression schemes and that kind of thing to be applicable for machine [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3567.2s)]
*  learning, which is growing at an exponential rate. I mean, this can only tie academia closer [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3572.72s)]
*  together with the military complex. And it's necessary for us to sort of become the wedge [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3578.7999999999997s)]
*  in between and make sure that that doesn't happen. And, you know, there's many ways to do that. I [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3584.64s)]
*  think that's also part of my article is we need to embrace a diversity of tactics. We need to have [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3589.8399999999997s)]
*  protest. We need to have demonstrations. We also need to have education. We need to have people [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3594.3199999999997s)]
*  understand what it is that they're doing when they do a homework assignment where they're [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3599.04s)]
*  calibrating the control system for a Boeing aircraft, right? What does it mean when they're [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3604.96s)]
*  doing a drone-based homework problem? Because that's stuff that appears in the theory classes at MIT [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3609.44s)]
*  is direct work on drones and things like that. So I hope that we can achieve this. I hope that we, [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3616.08s)]
*  as an academic community, can fight back. But I also hope that we connect with the wider community [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3621.84s)]
*  and we recognize that, you know, our academic work is not isolated. It's not some, you know, [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3627.6s)]
*  nice beautiful sphere of, you know, isolated from the rest of the world. But that it's actually [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3632.48s)]
*  explicitly part of the world. That it explicitly does have something to do with the way that [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3638.4s)]
*  war has developed. And it explicitly does have an impact on innocent lives across the world. So [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3646.88s)]
*  my hope is that we can continue to push that. I will definitely not be disappearing. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3653.7599999999998s)]
*  I'll be around in Boston whether or not MIT wants to have me. And I'm certainly going to be continuing [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3658.3999999999996s)]
*  to campaign. A lot of this information is, you know, like for example, the document you showed [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3663.52s)]
*  Nora earlier with describing the projects of the Israeli Ministry of Defense, that audit document [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3667.8399999999997s)]
*  is actually available publicly. I mean, a lot of this information is available publicly. A lot of [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3675.68s)]
*  information about MIT has to be made available publicly because they, you know, they take so much [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3679.84s)]
*  land, right, from the community. And that's maybe another aspect that I think is really important [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3686.32s)]
*  is to understand that these institutions themselves are colonial. That, you know, they are engaged [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3692.6400000000003s)]
*  very much in the gentrification of Cambridge, the gentrification of the areas around them. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3697.2000000000003s)]
*  That they are engaged also in the pricing out of various families who have lived there for decades, [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3701.28s)]
*  even for centuries. And we need to be able to hold that kind of institution accountable, right? MIT [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3707.76s)]
*  should not be considering itself a private university by any means. It takes up way too [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3714.2400000000002s)]
*  much of the land of Cambridge to be able to say that. So my hope is that we can continue to push [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3718.56s)]
*  on these things. And I think that, you know, given the energy that there is on campus, given the [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3723.92s)]
*  amount of outrage that, you know, my discipline but also the discipline of others has generated, [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3729.6s)]
*  my hope is that, I think I'm fairly confident that we will continue to be able to push down [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3734.96s)]
*  this path and get MIT to stop its ties with the Israeli Ministry of Defense. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3740.0s)]
*  Thank you so much, Prahlad, Iyengar, and Michelle de Graff for joining us today. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3745.2s)]
*  As I mentioned, we'll have all of these links, you know, to the report the MIT Coalition for [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3752.08s)]
*  Palestine has put out, as well as your piece, as well as some of your scholarship, Michelle, [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3758.8s)]
*  and ways that people can get involved and learn more about, you know, the incredible organizing [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3766.6400000000003s)]
*  and activism work that you're both doing and are a part of. So thank you so much for joining us [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3775.44s)]
*  today and keep us posted. We'd love to have you back on to talk about some victories next time. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3783.2s)]
*  Thank you, Hildenar. Thank you so much. And I want to give a major thanks to the students [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3790.16s)]
*  because they put so much on the line. Me, I'm 10 years old, so they might still kick me out, [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3795.9199999999996s)]
*  although actually they already kicked me out of linguistics without the MIT, but the students [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3801.12s)]
*  have so much more on the line being suspended, being expelled. So I, yeah, so I've also respected [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3806.16s)]
*  admiration for the students. So thank you for all your work and your movements. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3813.12s)]
*  Well, thank you, Michelle, and thank you, Nora, for also having us here. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3818.3999999999996s)]
*  Of course. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O194r5IS3ms&t=3821.6s)]
