# Know your rights: for student Palestine activists, with Radhika Sainath | EI Podcast
**The Electronic Intifada:** [October 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE)
*  So, you know, students are out on the street, they are speaking up on their campuses, and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=0.0s)]
*  for those people who are out there, we just want to say, please do keep on doing this. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=16.22s)]
*  And I want to give you some tips today. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=21.44s)]
*  The electronic intifada. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=24.96s)]
*  The electronic intifada. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=25.96s)]
*  The electronic intifada. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=26.96s)]
*  This is the Electronic Intifada Podcast. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=27.96s)]
*  I'm Nora Barrows-Freedman. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=28.96s)]
*  And I'm Asa Winstanley. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=29.96s)]
*  Welcome back to the Electronic Intifada Podcast. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=30.96s)]
*  I'm Nora Barrows-Freedman. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=42.68s)]
*  And we thought that we would do a special episode on how students are fighting back [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  smear campaigns at this time when their protests, their petitions, even just their presence [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=53.52s)]
*  on campuses are eliciting some of the most draconian smear campaigns and harassment [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  campaigns, not just by Israel lobby groups on campus or outside, but by administrations [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=67.84s)]
*  themselves. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=72.88s)]
*  So, I wanted to bring on our good friend Radhika Sainath from Palestine Legal. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=73.88s)]
*  She's a senior staff attorney there. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=79.08000000000001s)]
*  Palestine Legal has been, of course, at the forefront of defense for students and faculty [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=82.12s)]
*  and activists, but also in educating students, especially about their constitutional rights, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=87.48s)]
*  especially during times like these. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=97.0s)]
*  So, you know, Radhika, I've been getting all of these emails in the past week from students [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=98.68s)]
*  saying that they've been doxxed, that their personal information has been put online and [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  that they're getting death threats, harassment around the clock. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=111.56s)]
*  What are you seeing from your perspective as these intake forms come in at Palestine [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=116.12s)]
*  Legal? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=124.04s)]
*  How can you assess the situation right now for students? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=125.04s)]
*  Sure. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=127.56s)]
*  Well, first off, thanks for having me on, Nora, and thank you for all of your critical [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=128.56s)]
*  reporting at this time and getting the word out about what's happening in Gaza at a time [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=131.76s)]
*  when mainstream media is not covering Israel's genocide of the Palestinian people in Gaza [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=136.52s)]
*  right now. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=142.20000000000002s)]
*  So, thank you for that. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=143.20000000000002s)]
*  At Palestine Legal, we have been seeing an exponential surge in requests for legal help [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=144.20000000000002s)]
*  and for reporting of incidents in the past week. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=151.08s)]
*  It's like nothing we've ever seen before. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=154.44s)]
*  We've been working around the clock. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=156.24s)]
*  And before I get into some of the things that we've been seeing, I just want to step back [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=159.16000000000003s)]
*  and take a moment to say that the surge for requests for legal help is in part due to [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=162.96s)]
*  the outpouring of support for Palestinian freedom that we've been seeing and against [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=168.36s)]
*  Israel's genocidal campaign in Gaza. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=173.56s)]
*  So students are out on the street, they are speaking up on their campuses, and for those [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=176.36s)]
*  people who are out there, we just want to say, please do keep on doing this. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=181.96s)]
*  And I want to give you some tips today, but by no means do we want to chill you out. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  So, I think that's a good way to pull your speech, supporting Palestinian rights. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=192.79999999999998s)]
*  It's more important than ever. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=195.79999999999998s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=198.79999999999998s)]
*  So, let's talk about what students are facing. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=199.79999999999998s)]
*  I mean, right now, there are just a cascade of instances where even like the ADC has said [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=203.79999999999998s)]
*  that the FBI has been showing up on people's doorsteps. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=217.72s)]
*  I mean, this is like, we're just seeing this kind of, you know, again and again. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=220.72s)]
*  Here we are. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=226.84s)]
*  I mean, this is like very, you know, post 9-11, it has those echoes. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=227.84s)]
*  So Abed Ayub of the ADC says that we've received multiple calls today regarding Palestinian [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=232.68s)]
*  nationals detained by ICE and or visited by the FBI. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=237.56s)]
*  The FBI has also visited multiple mosques today in different states, as well as Arab [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=242.16s)]
*  inmates. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=246.04s)]
*  And this is a troubling trend. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=251.83999999999997s)]
*  Can you talk a little bit about what we're seeing and what to do if you are encountered [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=253.83999999999997s)]
*  by the FBI or any other, you know, state police force? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=266.32s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=271.48s)]
*  So some of the trends that we're seeing, and I will say the comparison to the post 9-11 [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=272.48s)]
*  environment is exactly spot on. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=277.16s)]
*  Unfortunately, we are really seeing a rise in Islamophobic and anti-Palestinian hate. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=279.48s)]
*  So just to give you a little bit of an overview of what we're seeing at Palestine Legal, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=286.48s)]
*  we're seeing Students for Justice in Palestine and Palestinian students threatened with violence [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=291.48s)]
*  and anti-Palestinian and Islamophobic messages who are unable to get support from their schools [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=296.88s)]
*  and basically being treated differently because they're Palestinian. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=303.44s)]
*  So for example, today, you know, students at UMass Amherst reported to us how they were [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=306.68s)]
*  being told by fellow students that they're, quote unquote, Islamic barbarism supporters [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=313.0s)]
*  who, quote, love raping and killing. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=318.84s)]
*  And even a student told them in person at a protest that all Arabs should be killed. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=321.48s)]
*  And the school has refused to put out statements supporting the students as it has with other [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=329.44s)]
*  student groups of different national origins when they've been the recipients of such hate. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=333.72s)]
*  We've seen students being smeared as supporting terrorists removed from positions or being [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=339.24s)]
*  investigated by their schools for making statements that are pretty much the same as the one that [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=344.04s)]
*  the Haaretz editorial board made. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=349.15999999999997s)]
*  We're seeing professors at universities being questioned, their classes cancelled, being [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=352.03999999999996s)]
*  locked out of their email all of a sudden over statements made supporting Palestinian [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=357.84s)]
*  rights. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=362.59999999999997s)]
*  And some of these statements are public statements on social media, but others have been just [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=363.59999999999997s)]
*  private communications over personal email, again, taking a principled stance against [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=366.24s)]
*  genocide and ethnic cleansing. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=371.35999999999996s)]
*  We've seen massive doxxing efforts naming students who have signed statements in solidarity [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=373.84s)]
*  with Palestinians calling these lists, quote unquote, college terror lists. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=379.64s)]
*  And these students have faced severe harassment, death threats, and threats to target their [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=386.28s)]
*  careers. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=391.56s)]
*  It's McCarthyite, to say the least. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=392.56s)]
*  We've also seen universities and K through 12, you know, administrators make statements [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=395.0s)]
*  only supporting Israeli students and not, you know, basically ignoring Palestinian students [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=402.4s)]
*  who have experienced loss. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=407.08s)]
*  This is particularly troubling, of course, given the skyrocketing number of Palestinian [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=410.52s)]
*  deaths in Gaza right now. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=414.68s)]
*  We've also seen blanket statements supporting Israel or condemning, quote unquote, you know, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=416.91999999999996s)]
*  Hamas terror by school administrators, which, of course, fuels this Islamophobic and anti-Palestinian [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=422.36s)]
*  environment, which led to the death of a six-year-old child in Illinois just yesterday, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=428.08s)]
*  which I'm sure people saw reports of in the news. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=432.84s)]
*  And again, you know, we're also seeing universities monitoring Palestinian students and groups [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=437.8s)]
*  supporting Palestinian rights, investigating them under the flimsiest of excuses. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=443.08s)]
*  Students are also have been contacting us. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=448.71999999999997s)]
*  They're really worried that they're going to be kicked out of school for just signing [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=451.03999999999996s)]
*  statements again that are protected by the First Amendment expressing solidarity for [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=455.2s)]
*  Palestinians. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=460.92s)]
*  So the list goes on and on. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=461.92s)]
*  But the bottom line is that we're really seeing a McCarthyite repression where people are [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=463.8s)]
*  being blacklisted, fired, doxed and, you know, criminally targeted again for taking principled [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=470.28s)]
*  stance for Palestinian freedom. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=477.2s)]
*  So, yeah, what are the material ways that students should be fighting back at this point, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=480.08s)]
*  protecting themselves? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=489.68s)]
*  You know, I mean, when I get these emails or these texts from students all over the country, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=492.2s)]
*  my first response is call Palestine Legal and reach out to ADC, reach out to the Center for [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=497.36s)]
*  Constitutional Rights. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=506.0s)]
*  After they've done that, what would be the next steps for them? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=509.48s)]
*  Sure. So I would say absolutely call us. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=514.84s)]
*  And actually, the best way to contact us is through our web form on our website. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=517.84s)]
*  We are checking that multiple times throughout the day. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=521.6s)]
*  And trust me, if you sent us a message to that web form, we have seen it. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=525.2s)]
*  We are triaging, though. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=529.36s)]
*  So if you don't hear from us immediately, go to our website or Instagram. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=530.92s)]
*  And we have just posted resources. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=535.36s)]
*  And those are the resources, the best resources we have on hand for the issues that are most [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=537.24s)]
*  coming to us. So those include like, what do you do if you're doxed? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=541.72s)]
*  You know, what if the police or FBI visit me? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=546.4s)]
*  What should I do? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=548.48s)]
*  Short answer, don't talk to the police. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=550.16s)]
*  Go there, look at those resources and, you know, and we will get back to you. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=552.56s)]
*  As far as, you know, other steps that you can take, I want to say that the most one [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=558.44s)]
*  of the most important things right now, if you feel that you're you know, if you're [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=565.2s)]
*  getting harassed, if you're this is on campus, if you're getting harassed, if you're [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=568.2s)]
*  getting death threats, you know, if there's any, you know, issue that you're facing of [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=571.48s)]
*  harassment or anti-Palestinian discrimination, report it to your school. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=577.72s)]
*  I know a lot of students think, you know, oh, my school is not going to do anything. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=581.96s)]
*  They're not going to take it seriously. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=585.96s)]
*  Like they know what's going on. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=587.6s)]
*  All of that might be true, but it's really important that the school has a record of it. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=589.48s)]
*  So, you know, just go to your schools like Title 9, just Google Title 9, your school or [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=593.72s)]
*  DEI, your school, or even, you know, your if there's a dean of students or, you know, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=599.32s)]
*  administrator that you know, tell them what's happened on written communication so that [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=605.8000000000001s)]
*  they are on notice about what's happening. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=612.08s)]
*  And I think they really do need to hear over and over and over and over again what is [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=614.4s)]
*  happening to you. And it's their duty to respond. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=619.24s)]
*  This is really important not just because we do hope that they respond, but also because [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=622.64s)]
*  if they don't, that later if we need to file a lawsuit or file a Title 6 complaint, we [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=627.24s)]
*  can tell the university you are on notice. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=632.56s)]
*  Palestinian students or students, you know, speaking up for Palestinian rights or who [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=635.28s)]
*  are perceived to be Palestinian, told you multiple times that they were getting these [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=638.28s)]
*  death threats, that they were getting these harassing messages and you did nothing and [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=642.28s)]
*  you ignored them. So please do just let your school know over and over and over again, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=646.68s)]
*  you cannot do this too much. It's really important. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=650.8s)]
*  And I just want to say, thirdly, there are administrators out there who are trying to do [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=653.1999999999999s)]
*  the right thing and are being told by their supervisors and by that their higher ups, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=657.56s)]
*  no, you cannot do this. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=662.52s)]
*  And by that, I mean, no, you cannot say the word Palestine or Palestinian in your email [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=663.8399999999999s)]
*  to support students. And so by being able to share those stories and, you know, you're [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=668.92s)]
*  helping your administrators who want to do the right thing, be able to do the right thing as [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=674.36s)]
*  well. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=677.7199999999999s)]
*  Exactly. And, you know, it was about a month ago that we did the story on what was [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=679.8399999999999s)]
*  happening to students at the University of Illinois at Chicago and how the administration [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=688.7199999999999s)]
*  was working hand in glove to suppress their free speech. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=695.28s)]
*  And I remember it was it was really indicative of the way that these students had [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=699.9599999999999s)]
*  self-organized and had been educated beforehand to know that they did not have to talk to the [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=708.6s)]
*  police, the campus police who came to harass them. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=716.1999999999999s)]
*  And that is only possible because they knew their rights beforehand. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=720.72s)]
*  Can you talk about what to do if you are forced, you know, if the university is trying to [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=724.5600000000001s)]
*  force you to talk to the police or if you're being harassed, intimidated by campus [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=733.76s)]
*  administrators or campus police forces, do you have to talk to the cops? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=742.0400000000001s)]
*  You do not have to talk to the police. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=746.88s)]
*  You never have to talk to the cops. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=748.88s)]
*  You have the right to remain silent. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=750.5600000000001s)]
*  If you're confused for any reason, you can just politely ask, you know, if you're [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=752.0s)]
*  confused about whether you are free to go, you can say, am I free to go? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=757.24s)]
*  If the police ask you questions, you can just say, I don't want to talk. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=760.8s)]
*  And sometimes sometimes they will actually be very friendly in order to trick you. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=765.04s)]
*  So, you know, it's not always like in the cop shows, they might just be like, I want to [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=769.28s)]
*  have a friendly chat. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=773.36s)]
*  You know, can I can I come in? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=774.44s)]
*  You know, and you can just politely say, no, I'll have my attorney call you. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=776.56s)]
*  And if it's the FBI, you can just ask for them for them for their card and, you know, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=780.96s)]
*  just repeat it over and over again. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=786.44s)]
*  I don't want to talk. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=787.96s)]
*  Please leave me your card. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=790.12s)]
*  I'll have my attorney call you. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=791.0400000000001s)]
*  It's critically important because sometimes people feel like they, you know, will look [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=793.12s)]
*  bad if they don't talk to the police. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=799.5600000000001s)]
*  They are trained to trick you. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=801.76s)]
*  They can lie to you, but it can be a crime to lie to to a police officer or federal [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=803.48s)]
*  agent. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=809.0400000000001s)]
*  So it's just better that you don't do that. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=810.52s)]
*  And I would just also add, you know, tell your roommates if you have a roommate, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=813.4799999999999s)]
*  sometimes, you know, a roommate will let the police in. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=818.28s)]
*  Right. And then all of a sudden, I remember this case from for many years ago, someone [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=822.56s)]
*  was studying like Lebanese history and there was some something like a book open on [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=826.28s)]
*  Hezbollah. And, you know, that was enough. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=831.8399999999999s)]
*  You know, so if you're if you have a concern about letting the police in, you can [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=835.04s)]
*  always just ask, like, do you have a search warrant? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=839.16s)]
*  If they do have a search warrant, you know, look at it and you can say, is that your [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=842.04s)]
*  address? Is it correct? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=845.76s)]
*  Is it your apartment number? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=846.76s)]
*  Should list the places to be searched. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=848.12s)]
*  If it says like your roommate's room, that means they can search that room, but they [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=849.76s)]
*  can't search yours. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=854.12s)]
*  There are more tips on our website, but you can take a look at those. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=855.8s)]
*  But the short of it is, is that you never have to talk to the police. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=860.24s)]
*  Perfect. Thank you for that. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=863.8s)]
*  And finally, yeah, how remind us how students can get in touch with Palestine Legal [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=866.4s)]
*  and and what you know, what you hope that that university administrations are are, you [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=873.76s)]
*  know, I don't even know, like how to describe how [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=883.88s)]
*  how just unbelievably pro genocide some of these university administrations are [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=887.96s)]
*  revealing themselves to be when they're saying that, you know, basically painting [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=896.36s)]
*  all Palestinians, including the Palestinian students on campus, of course, as, you know, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=902.0s)]
*  bloodthirsty terrorists, subhuman and Palestinian students can't have a protest [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=907.2800000000001s)]
*  against the genocide of their people. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=916.0s)]
*  What do you hope comes comes out of this, at least when we look at the legal context [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=919.52s)]
*  on what's happening in some of the statements that the administrators are making. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=924.64s)]
*  And I will say to students, if you're a public university, you know, you can FOIA [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=929.56s)]
*  these questions or these statements. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=936.8s)]
*  So and that means you can file Public Records Act requests. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=938.68s)]
*  You can Google it. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=941.1999999999999s)]
*  You had mentioned the University of Illinois, Chicago students, Nora, and that's what they [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=942.5600000000001s)]
*  did. And they found all kinds of interesting stuff about what happened behind the scenes, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=946.4000000000001s)]
*  what the school was doing that was unconstitutional or deeply problematic or violated [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=950.96s)]
*  of civil rights laws because they wanted to stop Palestinian students from entering an [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=955.72s)]
*  event on study abroad in Israel. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=960.5600000000001s)]
*  So, you know, students and this is this is supposed to be a way for regular people to [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=963.6400000000001s)]
*  do right. So you can just Google like, what records are you going to file? [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=968.84s)]
*  You can just type in your exact request, my state, and you can get form letters and you [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=972.2s)]
*  can just find out like, you know, what is happening behind the scenes? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=977.2800000000001s)]
*  What is the donor pressure that's going on that is causing universities to [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=981.6800000000001s)]
*  to condemn, you know, a group of people that's been living under military occupation [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=987.76s)]
*  that is currently being ethnically cleansed from Gaza, as we speak, instead of being on [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=993.76s)]
*  the side of justice. And beyond that, you know, even if you're you don't want to do [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=998.6400000000001s)]
*  have a duty to support your Palestinian students to, you know, to provide them resources, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=1002.24s)]
*  you cannot ethically as a university administrator just say that you are providing mental [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=1006.0s)]
*  health services to one subset of people and exclude another subset of people just because [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=1010.64s)]
*  you don't like them. The law does not allow for that here. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=1015.8s)]
*  And that's what we're seeing that's going on. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=1019.24s)]
*  And that's one thing I think students can do right now to find out what the university is [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=1022.1999999999999s)]
*  saying or doing behind the scenes that violates Palestinian students' rights. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=1026.36s)]
*  And I've put the website for Palestine Legal, Palestine Legal dot org here on the bottom. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=1032.28s)]
*  So be sure to check out Palestine Legal and fill out that intake form if you are [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=1039.5600000000002s)]
*  experiencing harassment and discrimination at your university or community center, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=1046.72s)]
*  wherever you are, you have a defense. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aorgb3gLLHE&t=1054.0400000000002s)]
