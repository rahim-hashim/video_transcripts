Video Description: On episode 55, we speak with professors Rabab Abdulhadi and Tomomi Kinukawa of San Francisco State University about their ongoing fight against attempts to silence Palestine scholarship. 
Last fall, a faculty panel found that the university failed to protect Abdulhadi from censorship by Zoom, which canceled a September 2020 event Abdulhadi and Kinukawa had organized.
That event featured South African anti-apartheid activists and Palestinian feminist icon Leila Khaled.
In February, another faculty panel once again sided with Abdulhadi in a grievance hearing.
The panel supported her demand for the university to fulfill its obligations to her Arab and Muslim Ethnicities and Diasporas (AMED) studies and to end the hostile work environment to which she has been subjected for more than a decade.
The university‚Äôs president vetoed both recommendations by the faculty panels, forcing the complaints into a lengthy process of legal arbitration.
SF State is ‚Äúcreating all sorts of technical difficulties, using every single bureaucratic trick in the book,‚Äù Abdulhadi says.
‚ÄúThose of us who actually work on Palestine, clearly, we know what this is. This is called creating facts on the ground, which we know that Israel is doing in its colonialism, racism and apartheid against the Palestinian people.‚Äù

# How to fight university censorship with Rabab Abdulhadi & Tomomi Kinukawa | EI Podcast
**The Electronic Intifada:** [April 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw)
*  Those of us who actually work on Palestine clearly, we know what this is. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=0.0s)]
*  This is called creating facts on the ground, which we know that Israel is doing in its [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=14.08s)]
*  colonialism, racism and apartheid. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=19.46s)]
*  The Electronic Intifada. The Electronic Intifada. The Electronic Intifada. This is the Electronic [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=24.76s)]
*  Intifada Podcast. I'm Nora Barrows-Freedman. And I'm Asa Winstanley. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=30.12s)]
*  Welcome back to the Electronic Intifada Podcast. I'm Nora Barrows-Freedman. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=40.36s)]
*  Mondo Weiss reported that in February, quote, a faculty panel unanimously sided with Professor [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=44.68000000000001s)]
*  Rabab Abdul-Hadi at San Francisco State University. In a grievance, she filed through her union, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=50.68s)]
*  the San Francisco State Chapter of the California Faculty Association. Abdul-Hadi's grievance [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=56.84s)]
*  reiterated her demand for SF State to fulfill its outstanding commitment to build Arab and [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=62.68s)]
*  Muslim ethnicities and diaspora studies, or AEMED studies, by hiring two additional tenure-track [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=68.68s)]
*  faculty members institutionally supporting the department, stopping the attempt to discredit [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=75.4s)]
*  AEMED and ending the creation of the hostile work environment to which Rabab has been subjected for [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=81.0s)]
*  at least 13 years for her directorship of AEMED and her refusal to abandon it. Thanks to Mondo Weiss [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=87.80000000000001s)]
*  for first reporting on that. And in early March, Rabab's colleague, Professor Tomomi Kinukawa, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=94.76s)]
*  also held a grievance hearing against the university's cancellation of the AEMED Open [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=100.84s)]
*  Classroom Program. Meanwhile, Rabab still faces cancellation and censorship. Students at Cardozo [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=106.44s)]
*  for Israel-Palestine, a group at the Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University in New York City, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=113.48s)]
*  say they had planned and advertised for an event with Rabab called, quote, Forms of Activism for [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=119.88s)]
*  Liberation in Palestine, scheduled for March 1. Students say, quote, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=125.64s)]
*  we sought to provide a platform for students on ways to collaborate with other lawyers, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=130.76s)]
*  scholars, and organizers in activist and intellectual spaces, regardless of students' [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=135.64s)]
*  professional pursuits. But less than a week before the event, the dean of Cardozo informed [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=140.52s)]
*  them that the president of Yeshiva University moved to cancel the event without their consent. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=145.96s)]
*  They say, quote, we then discovered that the school canceled our room reservation and catering [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=151.72s)]
*  order as well. Joining us to talk about all of this is Rabab Abdul-Hadi and Tomomi Kinukawa. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=157.32000000000002s)]
*  Rabab, I'm Tomomi. Thank you so much for being with us on the Electronic and Defata Podcast. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=162.84s)]
*  Welcome back. Thanks for having us. It's really great to be back. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=166.84s)]
*  Thanks. So as I mentioned, there have been updates in your grievance hearings [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=170.60000000000002s)]
*  against San Francisco State because of the ongoing censorship and repression of your [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=178.12s)]
*  department. The university's faculty senate rendered its unanimous decision in support [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=184.12s)]
*  of both your grievances, Rabab, and this one includes regarding your academic freedom as [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=190.44s)]
*  well as contract violations and creating hostile work environment, only to have them both vetoed [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=195.0s)]
*  by the university's president, Lynn Mahoney. And this is all because the Israel lobby has [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=201.88s)]
*  years targeted you and your colleagues because of the work that you do for scholarship on Palestine. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=208.76000000000002s)]
*  Both grievances now will go to legal arbitration, which could be a very lengthy process. What [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=216.60000000000002s)]
*  happens now? Give us an update on your case. Well, let me back up and just say that it was [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=222.68s)]
*  actually the faculty hearing panel is very important because it's a process. And that's [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=228.68s)]
*  part of our collective bargaining agreement between us as faculty workers at the university [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=234.76000000000002s)]
*  and the employer, employees and employers. And sometimes the university tries to present us [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=241.48000000000002s)]
*  that we are one big happy family and we'd love nothing more as faculty because we chose [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=246.52s)]
*  the career of teaching to educate, to educate, to learn, to pass on our knowledge to younger [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=252.36s)]
*  people and so on. It's not really for fame or fortune as everybody knows that. So the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=257.8s)]
*  problem and the faculty hearing panel, what's really, really important about it is that it's [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=264.6s)]
*  selected randomly by faculty who serve at their own time, at free, while the university is [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=268.44s)]
*  represented by people from the university who actually get paid, including the witnesses that [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=276.2s)]
*  university brings, the deans, the associate deans, the dean of faculty, the provost, anybody they [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=281.64s)]
*  bring are actually on that. So in that already we're talking about the big discrepancy. But the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=287.40000000000003s)]
*  fact the faculty hearing panel that is constituted jointly by the university and the union, so it's [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=292.6s)]
*  a very lengthy process. It's very, very complicated, lengthy process that the and we know some people, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=298.12s)]
*  we do not know everybody. And so it's basically that they go just down the line and they select [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=305.08000000000004s)]
*  and unless there are major objections, we don't know. So the fact that our colleagues [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=310.68s)]
*  came and said this is really wrong twice. First, they said that the university in both, they said [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=316.76000000000005s)]
*  that the university harmed me and my colleague, Professor Kinakawa, in shutting down our open [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=322.36s)]
*  classroom, whose narrative is gender justice and resistance, a conversation with Layla Khaled, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=328.6s)]
*  September 23rd, 2020, demanded that they apologize to us, that the university apologize to us. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=334.12s)]
*  And first they said that we were harmed because the university was arguing that we were not harmed. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=341.16s)]
*  And I think this is something we really need to talk about because our labor, our work, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=346.84000000000003s)]
*  the amount of anguish we go through is completely discounted. And what we had to go through, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=351.48s)]
*  which Professor Kinakawa can also speak about because they have their own grievance as well, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=356.44s)]
*  which is joint with mine. And secondly, that the university should apologize to us both. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=362.12s)]
*  And third, that the university should have the panel ASAP without delay. This is very reasonable. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=368.6s)]
*  They're not really outrageous claims or demands. This is the first one in academic freedom, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=375.64s)]
*  especially because President Mahoney keeps claiming that she supports academic freedom. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=382.36s)]
*  And people praise her for speaking for academic freedom and so on. So if she's speaking for [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=386.84s)]
*  academic freedom, why are her deeds against academic freedom? And when the faculty panel [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=391.08s)]
*  came that was chosen by the university and the union to say you really should do that, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=397.4s)]
*  the university president vetoed, vetoed it and said, I'm against it. Why would you veto it? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=404.52s)]
*  Why aren't you allowing it to happen? The second grievance was, as you mentioned, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=409.24s)]
*  it was around Ahmed studies and the breach of contract and the hostile work environment. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=413.47999999999996s)]
*  And the university enlisted the dean of the College of Ethnic Studies, the associate dean [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=418.28s)]
*  of the College of Ethnic Studies and the dean of faculty who came and practically spun tales, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=422.44s)]
*  which the faculty panel saw through. And we provided evidence. And I should say in the first [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=428.36s)]
*  hearing I was represented by my colleague, Dr. Sankhi Kil, who is a professor at San Jose State [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=434.44s)]
*  University, who herself has won her own grievances for the constitution of hostile work environment [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=439.96s)]
*  for discriminations against feminist and queer professors of color and so on. Actually, one of [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=446.59999999999997s)]
*  our colleagues two weeks ago also won a grievance at San Jose State University. It's outrageous [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=453.0s)]
*  what's going on at our campuses. And then the second panel I was represented by Professor [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=457.96s)]
*  Larry Handley was a professor of English and member of the executive board of the [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=462.92s)]
*  faculty, California Faculty Association San Francisco State chapter. So both are actually [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=468.92s)]
*  academics. They're not lawyers. They're not really legal experts. But it was also a team effort by [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=475.08s)]
*  many people who came together, put this together. We work with each other and everybody was really a [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=481.16s)]
*  labor of love. And what the university president did basically slapped us across the face. I mean, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=486.44s)]
*  the second one said, no, we're not going to be against it. We're not going to. And they what [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=491.4s)]
*  they did is they use technicalities. They'll say, oh, you could have filed this again, 42 days [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=496.84s)]
*  afterwards and so on. And the faculty hearing panel saw through it and said the hostile work [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=502.52s)]
*  environment is ongoing. The fact that you're refusing to hire faculty is ongoing because [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=508.52s)]
*  Ahmed is not allowed to grow. And I am there is the university is causing me harm. And they [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=513.88s)]
*  ordered the university to apologize as well. And they actually what's really significant, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=520.44s)]
*  they ordered the university to hire an associate and full professor level because they were [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=524.2s)]
*  reasoning that if the university had hired 15 years ago, the faculty members would now be if [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=528.84s)]
*  they were even assistant professors just out of grad school, would that you know, sometimes you [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=535.6400000000001s)]
*  hire people on the promise that they will get the Ph.D. Even if they were hired out of grad school, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=539.8000000000001s)]
*  by now they would have become associate and full professor. And actually, this is the case at San [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=544.6800000000001s)]
*  Francisco State. So they they they saw through it and they sought remedies that address structural [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=548.44s)]
*  problems that Ahmed studies must be built, that we need faculty, that it is impossible for me to [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=555.8000000000001s)]
*  continue to be one person program, that I'm not only building the academic program that I'm [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=561.8800000000001s)]
*  teaching alone. And now I'm in the same dilemma. I submitted the courses for the fall and for the [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=567.32s)]
*  spring of next year. And I'm still being kind of like volleyball between different parts of the [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=572.0400000000001s)]
*  university. And the only explanation we can find and the only explanation that actually the hearing [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=576.9200000000001s)]
*  panel was convinced with as well as many people who are reading about it and hearing is that the [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=582.2s)]
*  university is putting obstacles, creating all sorts of technical difficulties, using every [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=587.72s)]
*  single bureaucratic trick in the book, using quote unquote business as usual business decisions. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=593.72s)]
*  And it's I mean, those of us who actually work on Palestine clearly, we know what this is. This is [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=599.48s)]
*  called creating facts on the ground, which we know that Israel is doing in its colonialism, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=604.92s)]
*  racism and apartheid against the Palestinian people. You come up with sort of innocuous forms [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=611.7199999999999s)]
*  where there is thousands and thousands of orders and then you say, oh, it's only technical. It's [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=617.3199999999999s)]
*  technical. None of it is really intended to be discriminatory or racist or whatever is technical. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=622.36s)]
*  But actually, but the beauty is that the faculty hearing panel saw through that and said that this [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=627.4s)]
*  is what needs to be done. So that's really, really two big major, we believe one of them has to do [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=632.68s)]
*  about the ability to speak on an advocate for justice in for Palestine as part of the indivisibility [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=639.0799999999999s)]
*  of justice and legitimizing teaching Palestine within the curriculum, which you know, it has been [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=646.12s)]
*  an ongoing battle because the Zionist groups and their right wing allies. And by the way, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=652.3599999999999s)]
*  we should also remember that wasn't just Zionist groups who were very much opposing. It was the [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=657.4s)]
*  Zionist groups. It was the corporate university, San Francisco State University president and their [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=663.0799999999999s)]
*  corporate allies, including Zoom. And it was also the right wing groups because we've been targeted [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=667.4s)]
*  by campus reform by every single right wing group, Christian United for Israel. I mean, they all, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=672.76s)]
*  Doug Lamberne, who's a right wing congressman from Colorado. And they said, I mean, it's been really [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=681.4s)]
*  I know my colleague, Tomomi can speak more about that, what we were subjected to. So it's what this [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=687.72s)]
*  is. This is a coalition. We're talking about people who are on the right, who actually practice, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=692.84s)]
*  advocate racism, Orientalism, Islamophobia. And we would argue Dr. Kenneka and I, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=698.6800000000001s)]
*  colonial feminism. This is really also colonial feminism that draws on all the tropes of how Arab, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=706.84s)]
*  Muslim and Palestinian women, men, gender non-binary, that are feminist and queer groups [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=713.32s)]
*  and so on. We are constructed as being excessively terroristic, bloodthirsty, irrational, angry [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=720.0400000000001s)]
*  terrorists, exceedingly homophobic, exceedingly sexist. I mean, this is kind of like the university, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=726.9200000000001s)]
*  the head university leaders did that. And I would just maybe stop at that. And because I know [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=734.36s)]
*  Professor Kenneka and I have been kind of like in an ongoing conversation. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=740.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you have. Thank you, Rabab. Yeah, Tomomi, talk to us about the hearing that you [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=744.1999999999999s)]
*  were subjected to earlier in March and, you know, kind of how you see the reactionary forces inside [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=754.04s)]
*  academia, inside the Israel lobby, inside these right-wing groups that Rabab mentioned, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=765.4000000000001s)]
*  all kind of coalescing to try and stifle speech about Palestine in your classroom. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=770.9200000000001s)]
*  Yes, thank you. So I filed my own grievance that is identical with Dr. Hadi's grievance [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=780.5200000000001s)]
*  about the silencing of our open classroom. And on March 18th, this year, I finally got the hearing [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=790.04s)]
*  for the grievance. And prior to that, as Dr. Hadi mentioned, like when the faculty panel [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=800.4399999999999s)]
*  unanimously ruled in favor of Dr. Hadi's grievance, for a moment I thought maybe I don't have to [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=808.36s)]
*  continue my grievance. But then President Mahoney vetoed it. And then again, for the second [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=815.4s)]
*  grievance, Dr. Hadi's second grievance again. And so that kind of creates the context of my grievance. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=826.12s)]
*  And so starting with what we have to go through, I think in response to what Dr. Hadi already [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=837.72s)]
*  described, I think what I would add is that from the very beginning, both President Mahoney and [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=850.92s)]
*  also the provost's summit, it was very clear that they were using the language of the Zionists [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=862.44s)]
*  and sending us the threatening email without even checking their own lawyers and repeating [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=876.0400000000001s)]
*  what the Zionist organizations claimed. And they said they are like champions of academic freedom, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=884.04s)]
*  while they have no, like they have shown no help to protect our academic freedom. And especially [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=896.68s)]
*  the, they didn't, like they knew that like the Doe Fair project, which was the organization that [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=908.6s)]
*  brought our case to the Department of Justice, like, you know, accusing us of the kind of [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=921.08s)]
*  material support for terrorism. That organization has been attacking Dr. Hadi for a long time, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=928.0400000000001s)]
*  and the university had a full knowledge of it, but they have never criticized the organization, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=934.44s)]
*  their racist attack on Dr. Hadi and Ahmed. And then they continue to kind of use the [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=943.8000000000001s)]
*  Zionist conflation between critique of like apartheid state of Israel with anti-Semitism. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=951.16s)]
*  And they never, I mean, like, I mean, and then like, you know, that there is a lot of [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=961.32s)]
*  like the anti-Zionist Jewish scholars and activists who have been making the point [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=969.4000000000001s)]
*  for a long time in public and also on ISFSC campus too, Dr. Hadi organized like, you know, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=975.8000000000001s)]
*  like a teaching and open classrooms about the issue. And also our colleagues, like, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=984.2s)]
*  who were also panelists for the open classroom wrote to like President Mahoney about like the [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=992.12s)]
*  whole issue. And so it's not like, it's not like they didn't know, but they did, they chose not to [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1001.16s)]
*  critique, I mean, make the points. And that's like, as a feminist scholars, like it is, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1010.4399999999999s)]
*  I mean, I don't know, like it is, it is, well disappointing to say the least, but, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1019.4s)]
*  and it is also embarrassing intellectually. And so, and so that also, like, I mean, the [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1025.8799999999999s)]
*  fact that we had to deal with that. And then we had to kind of work really hard to counter [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1036.92s)]
*  the discouraging of our work by our leaders of our institution. That's been really, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1046.36s)]
*  that's been a huge toll on us. And so we had to defend ourselves, like we are putting in the [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1055.56s)]
*  position to be defending ourselves in front of our students, in front of our colleagues, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1064.36s)]
*  who are very much confused, right? Like because, you know, these high power academics were siding [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1070.6s)]
*  with Zionists. And so, so that's a violence that we had to go through. And like, and also, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1079.3999999999999s)]
*  and then through that experience, like, you know, like this only tip of iceberg, like it's [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1086.76s)]
*  the silencing of the open classroom is like only a part of the pattern that has going on for [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1094.76s)]
*  over not 15 years. And against Dr. Abduhadi and Ahmed and like, and this astronomical [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1102.04s)]
*  labor that Dr. Abduhadi had to put, you know, in like to defend, to not defend, to protect Ahmed, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1112.12s)]
*  so that's the like amazing program will continue to be available for our students, our communities, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1122.4399999999998s)]
*  all of us. And so, so the, it's been really, I mean, like, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1130.28s)]
*  I don't know, done itself, I mean, like the way the university has been doing that itself, like it's [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1136.44s)]
*  it's very difficult to live with and emotional labor has, like, we had to [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1153.0800000000002s)]
*  suffer from lots of emotional labor and like trauma from this whole experience. And so sorry, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1160.1200000000001s)]
*  going to our, my grievance hearing. So grievance hearing, it's, it's, it took a while for me to be [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1168.04s)]
*  able to actually have the hearing, there were lots of postponements and so forth. But then on March [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1178.1200000000001s)]
*  18th, finally, there was the hearing and everything on our team was going well. Dr. Kyo was already [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1185.0s)]
*  mentioned who represented me and we were presenting strong case. And we, the chair of the [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1195.0s)]
*  faculty hearing panel for Dr. Abdul-Hadis Grieban, Dr. Andrea Clay, who was one of the [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1206.12s)]
*  witnesses. And so she offered a witness, very strong, powerful witness in support of us. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1216.84s)]
*  And so we, we got to, so like, so I present, I did open statement and then we had Dr. Clay's [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1224.4399999999998s)]
*  testimony and Dr. Kyo's presentation. And, but then the hearing had to be adjourned abruptly. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1235.3999999999999s)]
*  It was, I mean, the university's representatives father passed away suddenly. And so the, the, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1245.1599999999999s)]
*  we had to adjourn. And so the, and then since then it's been almost two weeks, but I have not [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1255.72s)]
*  heard from the university, like how we are going to reschedule the rest of the hearing. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1269.16s)]
*  So everything is kind of, I mean, like, we are just, I'm very much confused, like, of how [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1275.24s)]
*  the process will happen. And we, we are still waiting to hear back from the [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1285.5600000000002s)]
*  administrators, how we are going to proceed from here. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1292.3600000000001s)]
*  Right. And if like in Rabab's case, the faculty panel agrees with your grievance and upholds it [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1296.52s)]
*  and says that the university has done harm to you as a professor and as a scholar, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1305.3999999999999s)]
*  Lynn Mahoney, the president of San Francisco State can veto it at her will anyway. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1313.32s)]
*  So, so we're dealing with like two, three cases going to arbitration, and this is all to, you know, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1320.2s)]
*  be able to teach in your classrooms to your students who want to learn from you. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1331.96s)]
*  You know, when you, when you kind of take a step back and, and, and, you know, look at it from a, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1339.56s)]
*  from a broader perspective. I mean, this is all meant, this is a very, you know, regular, familiar [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1344.68s)]
*  tactic with the Israel lobby, with powerful politicians who want to suppress, you know, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1353.3200000000002s)]
*  criticism of Israel, where they try and make activists, advocates, scholars so tired and so [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1358.76s)]
*  weary and so frustrated that they're spending, you know, more than a decade of their life and, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1369.08s)]
*  and, you know, scholarly work dedicated to filling out forms and going to grievance hearings, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1375.48s)]
*  you know, it's all meant to kind of wear you down. How, yeah, go ahead, Rabab. I was going to ask, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1383.1599999999999s)]
*  like, how, how you deal with that? Yeah. I mean, I was just actually thinking about [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1391.1599999999999s)]
*  during the 1987 Intifada of the Stone, and I always say, I don't say Intifada first and second [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1395.48s)]
*  and so on. You know, my, my, my argument about that, that it wasn't the first. People called it [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1401.64s)]
*  the first. Okay. But you remember that Ishak Rabin, at the time, the Minister of War of Israel, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1407.24s)]
*  not defense, ordered a policy of might, force and beatings to break the arms of young Palestinian [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1414.76s)]
*  children. Yeah, they don't breaking the bones policy. Yeah, breaking the bones to take them [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1423.16s)]
*  out of battle so they would not first intimidation, creating a chilling environment and also take them [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1429.24s)]
*  out for three, four months until their arms heal. And then we saw we saw it on CBS News, actually, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1436.52s)]
*  two Israeli soldiers breaking the elbow of a young kid that they were doing it again and again and [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1443.56s)]
*  there is all these tactics that we talk about collective punishment, because I think if we [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1450.92s)]
*  think about it, there are parallelism, not that of course, of course, it's not exactly the same, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1455.56s)]
*  but they remind us of how those in power who are opposing undemocratic, unjust practices, because [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1461.24s)]
*  they are catering and connecting with particular forces. And it's certainly this is what San [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1470.52s)]
*  Francisco State University administration is doing, whether we're talking about President [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1476.92s)]
*  Len Mahoney, we're talking about Provost Sombat, we're talking about the deans, several deans who've [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1481.48s)]
*  been involved in it, whether we talk about the whole CSU system, that just two weeks ago, we know [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1485.96s)]
*  about the whole scandal of actually giving a sweetheart deal to the Chancellor Castro, who was [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1491.8000000000002s)]
*  covering up sexual harassment. Meanwhile, they say, oh, San Francisco State CSU is sexually [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1498.6000000000001s)]
*  harassment free campus and so on. If it is free campus, how come you're giving him these millions [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1503.88s)]
*  of dollars as if you are rewarding him of actually consolation prize? And if it hasn't been for the [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1508.2800000000002s)]
*  activism of the faculty, the students, the staff unions, the unions and so on, who spoke up and so [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1513.64s)]
*  on, the next day there was a hearing at CSU last week with the board of trustees. That's when then [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1519.72s)]
*  they had to reverse their decision and so on. But they think of it as business as usual, because [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1525.16s)]
*  they're treating us as a corporation. It is sort of like that we're working for them and we're [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1529.96s)]
*  supposed to obey and they are supposed to say jump and we say how high and this is exactly the same [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1535.48s)]
*  thing that they are doing. What they are and this is and I'm saying and I'm bringing it in because [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1540.52s)]
*  people sometimes separate. They think that the universe is a different space than the Israel lobby, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1545.24s)]
*  that than the right wing forces and so on. Because I think we could also just like briefly, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1551.72s)]
*  this is not that we've done the topic here. We don't have enough time, but remember what [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1556.76s)]
*  happened when the uprisings rose up for black lives again after the murder of George Floyd. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1561.32s)]
*  You remember how the people who were protesting were called thugs, were called looters, were called [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1567.64s)]
*  all sorts of names, violent, angry, angry mobs and so on. I mean, this has this is very similar [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1574.44s)]
*  tactics. Ruined the reputation of people, character assassination, bad mouth them, [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1581.4s)]
*  bring the tanks, they brought in the tanks and tear gas and curfews. We know this very well. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1587.0s)]
*  Those of us who either work on Palestine or have grown up or under other repressive systems, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1591.8000000000002s)]
*  because it's not exceptional to Palestine. It's something that we're dealing with and focusing [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1597.3200000000002s)]
*  on. But this is what they are doing. They perfected that and they collaborate with each other. I mean, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1601.3200000000002s)]
*  only two weeks ago, Jewish Voice for Peace in New York exposed the Anti-Defamation League saying, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1605.48s)]
*  oh, this is really very bad. This is getting us egg on our faces. We might, we really need to kind [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1611.0s)]
*  of slow down this whole collaboration. But they cannot slow it down. They may be able to do it as [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1616.36s)]
*  public relations because the whole result of Israel is a military garrison state. It's a [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1621.0s)]
*  settler colonial military that is losing the battle in public opinion, that is losing the main [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1627.4s)]
*  source of its support in the United States. The United States is a very important place, [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1634.68s)]
*  not only because of the billions of dollars of military and economic aid and unconditional support [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1639.72s)]
*  that Israel gets and how, but it's also because for Israel to use, to lose, and for the Zionists to [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1644.1200000000001s)]
*  lose the grassroot support that's growing more and more and more, more and more and more among [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1652.28s)]
*  all people, but more and more and more among Jewish people, among younger Jewish people as well, [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1657.72s)]
*  that are saying, no, you can't speak in my name. What you're doing is not in my name. So what they're [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1663.64s)]
*  trying to do, they do these multiple tactics that we've seen before, chilling environment, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1668.76s)]
*  making you isolated, radioactive, so nobody will actually dare talk to you because if they're [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1673.72s)]
*  going to be punished as well, making you the poster child, the model, to kind of like silence [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1678.52s)]
*  everybody else. And we know so many cases in the academy. We know so many cases of the students and [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1683.64s)]
*  so on. It's inside and outside of the academy. It coincides with all the NTVDS bills and the [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1688.2s)]
*  against critical race theory against women and gender studies. Every single day we hear about it. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1693.72s)]
*  And the one thing that's really important about the movement now is that people are actually seeing [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1699.88s)]
*  the connection. It has been a very long time before people actually saw the connection. We're [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1704.2800000000002s)]
*  saying Palestine is not exceptional and Zionist lobby, Israel lobby, as well as the U.S. right-wing [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1709.0800000000002s)]
*  supporters and liberal, neoliberal corporate supporters, try to cover up for Israel by making [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1716.6000000000001s)]
*  exception. It's separate, it's different, it's the only democracy in the region and so on. And we [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1722.52s)]
*  know all of this stuff is not really true and we don't even want to waste time on it. But what [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1726.12s)]
*  they're trying to do then is what they can do is silence, silence people and silence people at the [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1730.68s)]
*  university where we are speaking to people's minds. We are providing critical thinking. We're not [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1737.56s)]
*  really telling students to, I mean, they tried multiple times to say I'm brainwashing students [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1744.12s)]
*  and students come and say even Israeli students, Zionist students say I took her class and I did [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1748.76s)]
*  really well. I got an A. It's not about I did my work, okay, because I am in it. We are. Ahmed is [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1753.08s)]
*  just a center of knowledge production program. It's defined as such. It's approved as such every [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1759.08s)]
*  single level including by CSU, all of it. So this is a program that maybe now they regret that they [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1763.64s)]
*  allowed us to actually advocate for it and get it. So they would like to silence it because they [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1769.8799999999999s)]
*  don't want to legitimize knowledge production within campuses where we are speaking to younger [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1774.92s)]
*  people, where we are teaching, we're providing all of the information. So students don't know. We [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1780.68s)]
*  didn't know. They didn't know about the slavery. They did not know about settler colonialism. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1785.64s)]
*  This is part of why the 68 strike, what we call the spirit of 68 at San Francisco State [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1790.28s)]
*  by Black Student Union, Third World Liberation Front Rose and build a big coalition and so on. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1795.4s)]
*  They want to nip it in the bud. They don't want to allow another 68 to happen. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1799.64s)]
*  They are very much troubled by it. So they try to silence us because Israel is failing [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1803.96s)]
*  in its public relations. It is unable to justify what it's doing. So bullies, as we all know, [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1809.56s)]
*  do not go away. They get nastier and nastier and nastier and they try to crush. And so their policy [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1816.44s)]
*  now is take no prisoners. They not only they do all of these things to you and make your life [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1821.48s)]
*  miserable and direct at you all sorts of psychological, emotional, political, bureaucratic, [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1826.1200000000001s)]
*  every single trick in the book that they can do. But they also try to take you out so you cannot [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1832.04s)]
*  advocate for what you are doing. So this also adds more labor to us because in our insistence [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1837.3999999999999s)]
*  to have open classrooms, our insistence to speak to our public, to our students inside and outside [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1844.6s)]
*  of the classroom. But one where my dean told me that the classroom is only for the students who [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1849.8799999999999s)]
*  are registered in it, i.e. those who pay. I said, I'm sorry, I believe in free education for all. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1854.52s)]
*  And the students are not only inside also the Palestinians say prison is a university, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1859.4s)]
*  but it's not only I mean, this is a saying in the past. But if you talk about the black prisoners [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1865.8000000000002s)]
*  in the US, you're talking about indigenous prisoners, you're talking about all the people [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1869.96s)]
*  who fight for freedom in prison. People also change and learn. And we have so many examples [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1874.44s)]
*  of that. So they would like to stop it. And they were like, so this takes much more work of us to [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1879.5600000000002s)]
*  do that. And so they get they get nasty and nasty. And I said, the good news for us is that [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1884.52s)]
*  they're losing. The bad news is that it takes so much work and it takes so much work. And it's [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1889.56s)]
*  intended as such. None of it is accidental. None of it is random. But they what they try to do to us. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1895.0s)]
*  I mean, we've been two years. This has been since 2020 and we haven't been able to have the [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1900.2s)]
*  classroom. And every single time we try to do a classroom, Dr. Kinna Kau and I, we collaborate. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1905.96s)]
*  We're doing another classroom in two weeks about historical deniers about Japanese historical [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1912.12s)]
*  deniers and Zionist historical deniers about Palestine comfort women, the collaboration, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1918.36s)]
*  because we all have like a lot of solidarity and collaboration working with each other in the Bay [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1923.2399999999998s)]
*  area and elsewhere. And it takes so much effort because we have no resources. I mean, Ahmed has [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1927.9599999999998s)]
*  zero budget. Yesterday, the financial dean of the college sent me a message saying, oh, we're going [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1934.4399999999998s)]
*  to give you more money. We are raising your work study from eighteen hundred dollars a year, [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1940.84s)]
*  one thousand eight hundred. We're giving you five hundred more. Thank you very much. When we don't [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1946.1999999999998s)]
*  have staff, we don't have a budget. We don't have faculty. I'm the only faculty member. You once [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1952.1999999999998s)]
*  scheduled our classes and then you come and say and that's what they argued, that our classes are [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1957.1599999999999s)]
*  low enrolled. You keep chipping up us. You do you mislabel the classes. You keep switching them. You [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1961.8799999999999s)]
*  hide them hiding classes, hiding. What does it and how is our students going to be able to [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1966.84s)]
*  register for for hidden classes? How are they going to find them? You do all of this stuff. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1971.8799999999999s)]
*  You chop up everything and then you blame the victim for actually trying to speak up for [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1976.9199999999998s)]
*  themselves by trying to present us as angry terrorists are to a pity. We're demanding things [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1981.72s)]
*  that we shouldn't have. We should just obey and be so grateful that we are getting these overworked [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1987.9599999999998s)]
*  positions and we're in it because we love our students. We are in it because we believe in it. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1994.52s)]
*  The good news is that our colleagues, our faculty colleagues, the union, the labor movement, people [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=1999.8s)]
*  are actually very much aware of learning more and more and more. So it's backfiring on them. So [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2005.32s)]
*  President Mahoney is very upset because the union has written several statements against her and [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2010.76s)]
*  criticized her and said that she was undemocratic. I just want to mention something. This is also [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2015.8799999999999s)]
*  built upon two years ago, the students, the Associated Students, student government passed [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2021.16s)]
*  a resolution for divestment from Israel and President Mahoney wrote them back. They deliberated [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2025.8000000000002s)]
*  for six months and they came with a democratic decision and she said to me, I'm sorry, I'm not [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2030.76s)]
*  going to implement it. Right. I mean, so what's the point of actually democratic participation? [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2035.4s)]
*  And they claim that we are coming from oppressive, repressive dictatorial context and so on. So what [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2041.4s)]
*  are you doing here? What are you doing here when you refuse to even implement decisions that are [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2048.04s)]
*  taken by a process that you agreed to, to start with? That's right. At a public university. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2053.16s)]
*  Right. That's supposed to be for the public. That's right. That's right. Well, we only have [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2058.2s)]
*  a few minutes left. Rabab and Tamomi, I wonder if you can just kind of briefly comment on what [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2062.52s)]
*  happened at Yeshiva University. Rabab, you were invited to speak there and then the president [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2069.64s)]
*  of the law school or the president of the entire university itself decided to cancel the entire [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2076.52s)]
*  event without any explanation. You know, this is yet another campaign to silence and censor [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2084.36s)]
*  Palestinian narratives and even any sort of discussion on Palestinian rights. What are [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2091.0s)]
*  the students doing about it and how do you see this situation taking place? And it's also [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2097.64s)]
*  backfiring just like what's happening at San Francisco. They try to silence us and then [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2103.88s)]
*  everybody realizes what's going on and we actually got more support than we ever had before. So these [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2108.28s)]
*  two young Jewish second year law students contacted me back in October and we've been talking again [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2114.76s)]
*  and again and they wanted to invite me and I said, can you at least contribute to our net? Can you [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2122.44s)]
*  at least contribute to the work we're doing? And so on. They said we have no money. I said, [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2127.48s)]
*  okay, so I'll just do it for you. No problem. And so we went, we negotiated, we get to the point [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2131.24s)]
*  where I was supposed to go and they wanted me to zoom in and I said, no, I will come actually in [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2136.04s)]
*  person because it doesn't make sense for the students to be gathered in the room and have [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2141.3999999999996s)]
*  somebody zoomed in. Since I am in the East Coast, I will come. And so we started actually thinking [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2145.08s)]
*  about security and talking to all our friends in Washington Heights and New York and so on [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2149.7999999999997s)]
*  to be supportive. And then it was less than a week. The students, the two students get called [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2154.6s)]
*  by the Dean of the Cardozova School and told that the president of Yeshiva University himself [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2159.72s)]
*  intervened and canceled the event. And they said, no, we don't want to cancel it. So they called me [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2165.72s)]
*  and we talked about it and they said, we don't want to cancel it. But then they couldn't actually [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2170.8399999999997s)]
*  have it because the university canceled the vending, the food, the dinner order that they had. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2174.52s)]
*  And then they canceled the venue. They canceled the reservation. So it wasn't actually even [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2181.48s)]
*  possible to have it. And the students really courageous young, which is also takes about the [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2186.04s)]
*  labor. They are doing human rights law. They're second year students. They're very, very excited. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2190.52s)]
*  What is going on there? They wrote an amazing statement. They contacted, they had 13 student [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2194.7599999999998s)]
*  clubs supporting them. They circulated an internal petition over 120 students. Students are writing [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2201.64s)]
*  them and saying, what do you want? What do you want to do? We want now there are mobilizing [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2208.2799999999997s)]
*  a coalition that people, different civil rights and legal organizations and [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2213.08s)]
*  Palestine support and Jewish voice for peace and many organizations actually [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2218.6s)]
*  support that outraged because and the thing is, is that Yeshiva actually hosted two very right wing [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2222.36s)]
*  violent races. I mean, this is the thing is that I was accused of antisemitism several times and [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2231.48s)]
*  every single time all the investigation and so on prove which is humiliating to even have to [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2237.0s)]
*  go through that. But I was proved that this is not true. All the accusations were not true and so [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2242.84s)]
*  on. And the students actually have done their work because they're law students. They're learning to [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2247.1600000000003s)]
*  become lawyers. And so and then the university actually even said, we're not going to we're not [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2251.08s)]
*  going to be hosting her. And they invited me to speak about kind of like collaboration, how people [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2256.6000000000004s)]
*  can work together. What's your decision? So the question is that what are they afraid of? Yeah, [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2261.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm always what are you afraid of? So they are insisting they're building, they're insisting to [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2266.44s)]
*  have me back. And I insist to go back. And I'm working with the students hand in hand, and they [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2271.8s)]
*  are amazing, too young, feminist activists, women who are like bearing the brunt and of this and the [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2277.2400000000002s)]
*  silencing and they're very courageous and they're doing it. So we're going to have the event at [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2284.92s)]
*  Yeshiva University, as we're going to have our classroom. Great. Finally, Tomomi, what can you [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2289.6400000000003s)]
*  say about, you know, the current atmosphere right now and what your students are telling you [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2297.56s)]
*  in terms of, you know, when they see you going through this kind of harassment by the institution, [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2306.2799999999997s)]
*  when all you're doing is trying to teach your classes, you know, what do you tell them? And [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2314.68s)]
*  and what are the next steps that that that, you know, supporters, not just students at [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2322.8399999999997s)]
*  SF State, but supporters out in the general public can do to support both you and Rabab? [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2329.24s)]
*  So, my students who got to attend, I met WGS Open Classrooms, they all have been [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2337.24s)]
*  like appreciating what they learned in the class and they have spoken very passionately, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2351.0s)]
*  like how much that actually transforms their understanding of racial gender justice and [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2358.84s)]
*  like anti-colonial, decolonial movements and Palestine, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2367.24s)]
*  Muslim feminism and so forth, like then feminism in general, like how they, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2374.84s)]
*  those costumes were really life-transforming for them. And [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2384.44s)]
*  so they get really many, so when I tell them what happened in 2020, many of them are like [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2393.88s)]
*  students are, some of them are like in disbelief and then and many of them do say like [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2404.44s)]
*  it is unacceptable that that is happening on their campus. And I think they relate to that [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2412.04s)]
*  through their own frustration about like their experience on campuses throughout this pandemic [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2418.12s)]
*  time and like many students, I mean, I teach women and gender studies courses, so I got to hear like [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2425.08s)]
*  their more like personal stories as a part of this feminist work. And so they, I think they [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2431.56s)]
*  do understand like that's like all their struggles and like what we are struggling with, with Amit [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2440.68s)]
*  and Dr. Abduhadi, those are all connected. And also that is, last year after the first [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2451.48s)]
*  veto by President Mahoney, Almanai and students, graduate students, labor and like also six-day [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2462.52s)]
*  strikers, all of them and faculty members got together and did a rally on campus in support of [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2472.6s)]
*  Dr. Abduhadi and Amit. And so there's like a growing movement on campus despite the fact [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2481.32s)]
*  that there's a lot of repression on campus. And also USR could be led a campaign to demand [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2490.1200000000003s)]
*  President Mahoney's resigning, I mean, resignment, resignation, sorry. And then some, [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2502.28s)]
*  I think Dr. Abduhadi already mentioned that how like a San Francisco labor council also issued a [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2511.5600000000004s)]
*  resolution in support of us. And so I think it is, we are looking at the growing movement and [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2519.0800000000004s)]
*  and that's like our colleague, like Dr. Robin Kelly, who was supporting USR could be campaign [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2528.52s)]
*  like mentioned that how like what we are looking at this connected to what's happening with the [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2537.8s)]
*  critical race theory, ethnic studies and like what the president at SFSU, like the administration [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2544.44s)]
*  at SFSU is doing is making a very dangerous precedent in this very difficult time. I mean, [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2553.08s)]
*  like a dangerous time. And so I think like we really need to like keep pressing and like expanding [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2560.36s)]
*  our movements to support existing movements. Thank you. Thank you. Tomomi Kunokawa and [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2573.16s)]
*  Rabab Abduhadi, both professors at San Francisco State University and members of the AEMED, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2586.2s)]
*  or Rabab is the only member of the AEMED studies program there at SF State. If people want to learn [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2593.0s)]
*  more about AEMED studies and support both of you, where can they go? They can go there is [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2601.24s)]

*  we'll also have it on the podcast post. They signed the petition to demand the resignation of [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2617.24s)]
*  President Mahoney and holding accountability and demanding that San Francisco State implement [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2625.3199999999997s)]
*  the decisions by the faculty hearing panel and attend the next hearing for my colleague, [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2630.44s)]
*  Professor Tomomi Kunokawa. Just come and support us. Show us love, show us support, show up for us [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2637.4s)]

*  I hope you get some rest soon. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2655.96s)]
*  Of course. Thank you. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEjiy85Qkw&t=2662.52s)]
