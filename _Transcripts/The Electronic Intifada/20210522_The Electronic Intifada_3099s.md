Video Description: On episode 36, Nora and Asa host a discussion on the advances of the Palestinian resistance tactics and Israel‚Äôs strategic mistakes during Israel‚Äôs latest assault on Gaza.
We are joined by our colleague, The Electronic Intifada‚Äôs executive director Ali Abunimah and journalist and researcher Jon Elmer.
‚ÄúOnce a colonized, occupied people makes a decision to free itself, that decision is really irrevocable, and they are prepared to pay a high price,‚Äù Ali says.
‚ÄúWe also emerge with Palestinian consciousness enhanced: pan-Palestinian consciousness across historic Palestine.‚Äù
Jon is Nora‚Äôs co-host of The Brief Podcast. He lived in Gaza and the West Bank for years, documenting both Israel‚Äôs attacks and the Palestinian armed struggle.
Jon said: ‚ÄúAs far as the rockets go: there‚Äôs more of them, they‚Äôre going further, they‚Äôre deadlier, they‚Äôre being used more tactically, effectively to go around the Iron Domes. This is something that‚Äôs been developing in Gaza for a long time.‚Äù
The discussion was recorded on Thursday just as a ceasefire was brokered by Egypt, after 11 days of intense Israeli state violence.
Around 260 Palestinians have been killed throughout their homeland ‚Äì the lands comprising Gaza, the West Bank, including Jerusalem, and Israel ‚Äì since 10 May, with thousands more injured.

*  We are gathered today to talk about what's been happening the last few days on the ground [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  in Gaza, the West Bank and historic Palestine. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=51.64s)]
*  Today we're recording on May 20th and we're joined by Ali Abunimah, our executive director, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=55.28s)]
*  and John Elmer, who's a researcher and my co-host at the Brief Podcast. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=61.56s)]
*  John and Ali, thanks for being with us today. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=67.34s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=70.92s)]
*  Thanks for having me back, Norah. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=72.68s)]
*  Ali let's begin with you. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=76.68s)]
*  Let's talk about the last few days, the last few nights of attacks. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=80.2s)]
*  Over 230 Palestinians have been killed in hundreds of airstrikes by Israel. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=84.36s)]
*  Give us your sense of what's been happening and yeah, just your observations over the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=91.36s)]
*  last few days. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=96.68s)]
*  Yeah, well, as we're speaking, there's a report that a ceasefire is imminent, perhaps within [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=97.68s)]
*  a day or within hours or two days. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=108.16s)]
*  I think it can't come soon enough for people in Gaza who have been under horrific bombardment [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=111.28s)]
*  for now 10 days. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=118.2s)]
*  A bombardment which has targeted, specifically targeted civilians. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=122.96s)]
*  There have been massacres as we reported the Electronic Intifada. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=128.12s)]
*  14 families have been essentially wiped out in Gaza. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=134.16s)]
*  The vast majority of the dead are civilians and more than 1700 people have been injured. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=139.20000000000002s)]
*  And there has been systematic Israeli targeting of civilian infrastructure, high-rise residential [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=151.08s)]
*  buildings, private homes, businesses, banks, clinics, just everything that is essential [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=158.2s)]
*  to life. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=167.44s)]
*  And that is not an accident. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=168.44s)]
*  That is not so-called collateral damage. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=171.0s)]
*  It is the Israeli strategy, the so-called Dahya doctrine that they developed or first [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=173.28s)]
*  rolled out, let's say on Lebanon in 2006 when they deliberately destroyed the southern suburb [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=180.35999999999999s)]
*  of Beirut. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=187.67999999999998s)]
*  And the logic is that, you know, we're going to inflict so much pain and suffering on the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=188.67999999999998s)]
*  population at large that no one will ever dare resist us again, or at least for a very [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  long time. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  And that is because, I mean, I think cruelty has always been the kind of doctrine of Zionism. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=204.0s)]
*  The Iron Wall is Jabotinsky, the spiritual father of the Likud Party and of Benjamin [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=213.72s)]
*  Netanyahu's ideology and of Zionism generally. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=221.12s)]
*  You have to be cruel enough to the Arabs that they understand that there's no point fighting [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=225.44s)]
*  against the Zionist state. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=232.04000000000002s)]
*  But also, I think it's because there are really no so-called military targets in Gaza. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=236.32000000000002s)]
*  This is an asymmetrical conflict or battle. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=243.84s)]
*  We're talking about a 21st century military armed by the United States and the European [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=248.4s)]
*  Union on the one hand, and basically a guerrilla army, a resistance movement on the other hand, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=254.8s)]
*  that doesn't have big stationary military targets, that doesn't have big military bases [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=262.32s)]
*  or, you know, columns of tanks or warplanes. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=267.32s)]
*  So that's why Israel, its only strategy to try to sear into the consciousness of Palestinians [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=271.28s)]
*  that there's no point resisting is to attack the civilian population. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=280.84s)]
*  Just as the United States did in the Vietnam War, just as, you know, all colonial regimes [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=286.6s)]
*  do, you inflict suffering on the population in the hope of demoralizing them and getting [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=292.6s)]
*  them to turn away from resistance. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=299.48s)]
*  Now what I want to say about the ceasefire, if and when it comes, is that what's significant [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=302.16s)]
*  is it will come with Israel having achieved nothing except death and destruction. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=312.28s)]
*  As I always say, if winning a war means killing, you know, massacring men, women and children, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=318.35999999999996s)]
*  then Israel is always the winner and always the world champion. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=326.91999999999996s)]
*  But if it means changing the strategic equation, if it means increasing the legitimacy of Zionism, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=330.67999999999995s)]
*  if it means defeating Palestinian resistance and making Palestinians kneel and accept that [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=339.48s)]
*  they just have to live under Zionist rule, then Israel is always the loser and it has lost again. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=348.12s)]
*  And the final sort of opening observation I'll make is that I think the Palestinian cause [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=355.0s)]
*  emerges from this horror, and it is horror. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=364.36s)]
*  First of all, having paid a terribly high price in civilian lives, but one that clearly [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=367.24s)]
*  Palestinians in Palestine were willing to pay in the sense that any colonized people, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=375.56s)]
*  you know, if you look at Algeria, a million and a half people died in that war to free [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=383.96000000000004s)]
*  the country from French rule, because once a colonized occupied people makes a decision [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=390.52s)]
*  to free itself, that decision is really irrevocable and they are prepared to pay a high price. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=398.2s)]
*  And what we've seen here is that we also emerge with Palestinian consciousness enhanced, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=404.6s)]
*  pan-Palestinian consciousness across historic Palestine. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=414.28s)]
*  This is the first time in decades or perhaps ever that Israel is, in a sense, forced to confront [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=418.59999999999997s)]
*  Palestinians on three fronts at the same time. Palestinians in Gaza resisting militarily, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=426.03999999999996s)]
*  Palestinians in the West Bank resisting against occupation forces, and Palestinians across [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=433.24s)]
*  Israel within, you know, the 1948 boundaries of Israel resisting against the racist state. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=440.84s)]
*  Like never before. And the Israeli strategy for controlling the Palestinians has always been based [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=448.52s)]
*  on the colonial tactic of divide and rule, fragmentation. If Israel can deal with Gaza [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=455.64s)]
*  by itself, it can deal with the West Bank by itself, it can perhaps deal with the Palestinians [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=462.2s)]
*  within Israel by itself, but I think it's a significant change in the strategic equation. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=467.71999999999997s)]
*  If all Palestinians across Palestine are in revolt and in active resistance at the same time. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=474.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the Israeli mayor of Lid called for a national emergency and insisted that Netanyahu [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=484.11999999999995s)]
*  bring the military forces in to the city to quell Palestinian uprising. I mean, yeah, has this, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=494.12s)]
*  I mean, this is really Israel's worst nightmare in many ways, and it doesn't seem like the resistance [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=502.6s)]
*  is being quelled. Well, Israel made a strategic miscalculation, and this is against, you know, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=509.96000000000004s)]
*  let's look at the regional political context. Less than a year ago, there was really a triumphalist [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=516.84s)]
*  tone among, in Israel and its allies in the region in the United States, that the Palestinian cause [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=524.44s)]
*  was dead, that the Palestinian people were isolated, that it was a losing struggle, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=531.8000000000001s)]
*  and that Israel had succeeded in imposing a reality on the Palestinians that they could [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=537.32s)]
*  do nothing about. And that's why we saw Arab regimes like the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=543.72s)]
*  and Morocco coming out into the open with their long-standing relationships with Israel, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=551.5600000000001s)]
*  signing the so-called Abraham Accords. And of course, all that was backed more or less openly [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=557.64s)]
*  by Saudi Arabia. And really, the only question was, when will Saudi Arabia officially join the party? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=564.76s)]
*  You know, is it going to be, you know, right away or, you know, in six months' time? So there was [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=572.92s)]
*  this air of triumphalism, and they celebrated their marriage to Israel over what they all thought was [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=579.64s)]
*  the dead body of the Palestinian cause. So this revolt, this uprising, this resistance, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=585.88s)]
*  is really a rude awakening for Israel, the United States, and its clients in the region. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=595.72s)]
*  And it really does change the strategic equation on a number of levels. And I think it deals a [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=602.52s)]
*  severe blow to the trend of normalization. It reestablishes the Palestinian cause as really [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=610.0400000000001s)]
*  the central cause in the region. And it explodes the fantasy that I think many of the Arab regimes, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=619.0s)]
*  but also the Americans, Europeans, and Israelis had that the Palestinians can just be dealt with [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=628.6s)]
*  by so-called conflict management, a little bit of economic aid and string them along with a fake [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=636.6s)]
*  peace process. But they really can't upset the strategic equation, which was about creating a [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=643.4s)]
*  American-backed regional alliance to confront Iran and to, you know, destroy any states in [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=651.88s)]
*  the region that could resist, you know, U.S.-Israeli hegemony. And I think that we are really dealing [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=658.84s)]
*  with a new situation. I want to bring John into this. John, you lived in Gaza for many years [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=665.64s)]
*  during the second Intifada, and you've been researching the, you know, the equipment and [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=671.88s)]
*  technology of resistance factions, especially in Gaza. Can you give us a sense of what you've been [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=680.4399999999999s)]
*  noticing in terms of the, you know, the rockets and technology and the strategy of resistance [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=687.48s)]
*  factions in Gaza? Yeah, I mean, as far as the rockets go, there's more of them. They're going [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=697.16s)]
*  further. They're deadlier. They're being used more tactically, effectively to go around the iron [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=703.0s)]
*  domes. This is something that's been developing in Gaza for a long time, and it goes back to [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=709.08s)]
*  I mean, really, it goes back to the late 80s, when Israel walled off the Gaza Strip in the first [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=717.48s)]
*  place during the first so-called peace process. But particularly since 2005, when the Israelis [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=722.6800000000001s)]
*  pulled out of Gaza and left Gazans with a ghetto, an unlivable ghetto, according to the United [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=729.48s)]
*  Nations, but a piece of property, a piece of land, a base of operations, and they took advantage of [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=738.44s)]
*  that and have built an Indigenous production system for developing weaponry. They've dedicated [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=745.8s)]
*  considerable attention to taking what for 20 years before was like a series of armed groups [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=754.5999999999999s)]
*  and bringing them all under one banner in a joint operations room, not competing with each other, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=764.4399999999999s)]
*  but working together. The 2014 war was all about Israel telling us that they had been fighting [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=769.32s)]
*  terror all these years, right? And that was the war 2014 where they said, no, we're fighting an [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=776.7600000000001s)]
*  army now. We've put together an army. Ahmed Jabari, who was the head of Qassam at the time, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=782.36s)]
*  was assassinated just before ceasefire negotiations, long-term ceasefire negotiations [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=789.4000000000001s)]
*  were taking place before the 2012 war. So the idea of ceasefires and the resistance and the [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=796.52s)]
*  ability for a ceasefire to hold, another one of the developments that's happened is that [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=804.36s)]
*  Hamas's Politburo is in control of Yahya Sinwar, who was a founding member of Hamas [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=811.16s)]
*  and was the leader of the prisoners in jail. He was released in the Shalit exchange, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=818.68s)]
*  and he went to Gaza in 2016, I guess it was, and he ran for leadership of the Politburo in Hamas [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=824.2s)]
*  and was elected. So the leadership in Hamas is in the Gaza Strip is a Qassam-based leadership. It [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=836.04s)]
*  puts the primacy of the armed struggle in the movement in the top position of the Politburo. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=844.04s)]
*  That's an important thing when it comes down to a ceasefire, because if we're talking about a [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=849.96s)]
*  ceasefire for like a week or two, and then fighting again, if you're talking about a ceasefire that's [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=854.2s)]
*  going to hold, Israel needs to have legitimate authority, accepted authority on the ground for [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=859.64s)]
*  the Palestinians. This idea of 30 years of collaborators who have no legitimacy, who only [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=867.8000000000001s)]
*  answer to Israel, those ceasefires have no meaning. But when you have a situation with a [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=875.56s)]
*  proper military leadership that's been built since the 1980s, we only see it every five years or [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=880.92s)]
*  whatever when this happens. But this capacity is what forces Israel into these positions of, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=888.1999999999999s)]
*  well, first of all, it forces them into the positions of massacres because they can't deal [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=897.9599999999999s)]
*  with the resistance face to face. So they massacre people like Shadjaia, right? They attempted to [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=901.72s)]
*  invade Shadjaia in 2014. They got like 100 meters, got smoked, stopped, turned around, and just laid [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=908.6s)]
*  the place to waste. So that's the dynamic that Palestinians, these massacres are punitive, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=915.24s)]
*  and they're also a symbol that they can't get at what they're trying to strike. The last war and [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=921.88s)]
*  the period in between, we were told so much about tunnels, the tunnels where they were going to come [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=927.32s)]
*  out of the tunnels and they were going to attack Israeli settlements. The Israelis went around the [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=931.6400000000001s)]
*  entire edge of the Gaza Strip, poking holes, trying to find tunnels. There's been nothing of [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=936.7600000000001s)]
*  that this time. The anti-tank missiles have kept the Israelis away from the border where they used [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=943.6400000000001s)]
*  to be for years and years and years. We used to always see the like associated press footage, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=949.88s)]
*  with the Israelis standing beside their tanks on the border with Gaza doing like praying or sitting [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=954.1999999999999s)]
*  on the cannons. You could see tanks all around. Islamic Jihad released a video yesterday, a drone [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=959.48s)]
*  video that showed that there was nobody anywhere near the borders in Gaza. I mean, you guys covered [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=964.76s)]
*  it as well as anybody in the great marches in Gaza. The soldiers would line up on those berms [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=970.52s)]
*  on the edge and just shoot into the ghetto, killing people. Those berms are not manned right [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=976.76s)]
*  now and there's nobody around the border of Gaza. That kind of situation forces Israel's hand. They [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=984.68s)]
*  don't have a way to achieve in the like whatever neoliberal definitions of achieve a victory of a [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=993.64s)]
*  colonial war. Hamas and Islamic Jihad can fire rockets for months and months and months. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1001.96s)]
*  They're not in a rush. Obviously, the carnage in Gaza is terrible, but the carnage doesn't [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1011.08s)]
*  make people weak need in Gaza. It does the exact opposite. I think you guys have seen it all around. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1019.64s)]
*  Unity and the unity that came from Gaza was isolated. That was Israel's strategy, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1026.76s)]
*  isolate Gaza. When all that stuff happened at the Al Aqsa and all the Ramadan shenanigans that [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1033.72s)]
*  Israel was pulling off and then once they actually got violent about it, people in the West Bank [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1040.44s)]
*  asked for a response, a unified response from the national movement and they got it. The same with [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1046.28s)]
*  1948. It's a big deal what happened in 48. The seeds of those uprisings are strategic issues for [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1052.44s)]
*  Israel. They're not things that go away with a ceasefire. I was talking about this last night on [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1061.16s)]
*  Five Pillars program, which is a British Muslim website. It is just a reality that the Palestinian [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1068.68s)]
*  armed resistance in the Gaza Strip, its capabilities have become increasingly sophisticated [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1080.12s)]
*  since over the years. We saw it in 2014. You read Max Blumenthal's book, The 51 Day War, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1089.7199999999998s)]
*  about the 2014 massacre, which to me was the definitive book about it, about that war. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1099.4799999999998s)]
*  And he gets into that, what exactly you were talking about there, John, that [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1108.1200000000001s)]
*  the Israelis could not invade. Whereas during the second Intifada, they were able to invade [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1114.0400000000002s)]
*  at least parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, or we invade. They weren't able to get [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1122.3600000000001s)]
*  barely a foot into the Gaza Strip and they just had to pull out and as you said, just level entire [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1132.28s)]
*  neighborhoods, vindictively flatten them to the ground. So I think it does show that [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1136.68s)]
*  the only thing that the Israeli military is really skilled at doing is killing civilians. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1145.48s)]
*  I think there are still people in the solidarity movement who talk about the rockets from Gaza [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1154.68s)]
*  being firecrackers and I just don't think it's true. I think that Palestinian resistance, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1163.32s)]
*  and this is what we've seen in this latest Israeli aggression, is that [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1173.72s)]
*  they've been hesitating. This is why they've not been able to invade. We've seen reports, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1183.08s)]
*  there was rumors deliberately circulated by the Israeli army to the press that they had already [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1189.72s)]
*  implied they'd already invaded last week, they'd already invaded the Gaza Strip, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1196.6000000000001s)]
*  whereas they hadn't at all. And it was just disinformation. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1201.8s)]
*  Yeah, that was supposedly a ruse to try to draw Hamas into this underground tunnel network [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1205.88s)]
*  that the Israelis say exists near the borders and then to try and bomb the tunnels and collapse them [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1213.48s)]
*  on top. But I just want to say, if I can say something, I don't think it's the goal of Hamas [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1219.24s)]
*  to kill Israelis. That's the propaganda element of Israel and the Western media. It is the goal of [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1231.4s)]
*  Israel to kill Palestinians and they do it very effectively. I think it's Israel's goal to kill [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1241.4s)]
*  as many Palestinians as they can get away with. In other words, to make it look as if they're not [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1247.88s)]
*  trying to kill Palestinians while killing them in order to exact this high price on Palestinians. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1253.48s)]
*  But look at what Palestinian resistance groups have done this time around. Last time in 2014, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1261.16s)]
*  it was a big deal when Israel was forced to shut down Ben Gurion Airport for a few hours or for a [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1269.88s)]
*  day. It's been shut down for a week now. It's been shut down since the beginning. World airlines [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1277.56s)]
*  have canceled their flights. And it may be because of the pandemic that that's less shocking that [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1283.48s)]
*  it would have otherwise been because we're so used to international travel being shut down now in a [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1291.48s)]
*  way we weren't in 2014. But nonetheless, this came at a time when Israel was celebrating [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1297.24s)]
*  its vaccination campaign and re-emerging and reopening international travel and business. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1305.64s)]
*  It's been shut down. That costs an advanced economy like Israel a massive amount. I don't [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1312.5200000000002s)]
*  know what these are based on, but I've seen reports saying it's costing Israel a billion dollars a day. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1320.6000000000001s)]
*  That doesn't seem unreasonable to me when you think of an economy like Israel's. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1326.1200000000001s)]
*  And the other thing I just wanted to point to in response to John's observations, which I find [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1333.0s)]
*  always so fascinating and insightful, is that I think Israel's hubris with this kind of triumphalist [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1340.76s)]
*  feeling that the Palestinian cause is dead was that they could accelerate the ethnic cleansing [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1352.12s)]
*  of Jerusalem and Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan and the attacks on the Al Aqsa Mosque with total impunity [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1358.84s)]
*  because in the Israeli mind, the Palestinians in Jerusalem were isolated. That was 200,000 people [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1365.0s)]
*  who could do nothing against the Israeli state. They were cut off from the West Bank. They're cut [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1373.72s)]
*  off from Gaza. They're cut off from anyone else. And so it was a major Israeli strategic miscalculation [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1379.72s)]
*  to think that the resistance in Gaza would not dare to respond from Gaza to Israel's actions [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1387.64s)]
*  in Jerusalem. And I cannot emphasize enough how that also changes the equation. Israel will now [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1396.0400000000002s)]
*  have to consider that whatever it does to Palestinians anywhere could result in six million [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1403.64s)]
*  Israelis being in bomb shelters for a week, at least. Yeah. Yeah, John, what's the significance [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1411.48s)]
*  also of the concurrent resumption of activities that were announced by some of the West Bank [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1418.44s)]
*  military factions, factions that had been dormant for years, especially as the PA had [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1426.44s)]
*  worked in conjunction with Israel to quash any sort of resistance activities? Yeah, I mean, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1432.68s)]
*  it's an interesting development. When we're talking ceasefires, can Hamas agree to a ceasefire while [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1440.04s)]
*  Islamic Jihad and the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades are in gunfights in the West Bank? Or more to the [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1445.96s)]
*  point, the guns came out in the West Bank in the last two days because Israel started killing people [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1451.64s)]
*  with live ammunition. And so those are considerations that go into any ceasefire now. And the legitimacy [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1455.72s)]
*  of the resistance is what will hold a ceasefire for Palestinians. You know, in the way that [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1464.6s)]
*  Israeli commentators can't understand why Abbas couldn't just secure Jerusalem, right? [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1471.0s)]
*  You have to have somebody who's got legitimacy on the ground in the population in question to hand [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1476.28s)]
*  out orders like a ceasefire in the middle of a war where your families are being massacred. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1483.08s)]
*  Just one thing about the rockets. The rockets are a product of the environment, right? They [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1489.0s)]
*  walled off these people in a ghetto that they can't get out. They don't give them any kind [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1496.36s)]
*  of pass system to get in and out, basically, at all. Making standoff weaponry was going to be [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1501.32s)]
*  obviously something that they would do. It's not necessarily that it's a tactic that you would pick [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1508.04s)]
*  in any situation, but to have it in the Gaza Strip just makes perfect logical sense. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1514.92s)]
*  And that's where the question of the West Bank resistance comes in, because we haven't seen yet [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1520.68s)]
*  resistance on this level, armed struggle, popular protest on this level in the West Bank, and since [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1527.48s)]
*  they walled off the West Bank. So it's not entirely clear to me how the next intifada in the West Bank [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1533.24s)]
*  unfolds when people are in like what 16 mini ghettos, mini gazas around the West Bank. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1541.72s)]
*  Is that fighting going to be through the PA? Is Israel going to come into the West Bank [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1550.28s)]
*  ghettos to fight? There's a lot of questions that are questions that the Israelis don't want to [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1555.24s)]
*  answer. And that's the same thing I would say about the ground invasion. Ask an Israeli soldier who [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1560.04s)]
*  fought in 2014 if he wants to be at the front of the line to go into Gaza. They have like a [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1567.72s)]
*  conscripted army, right? They're calling up reserves. They're saying one of their original [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1575.0s)]
*  bluster was they're calling up reserves, 9,000 reserves. People who are school teachers from [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1579.8s)]
*  Monday to Friday, that's who they're calling up. Are those people going to want to be the first to [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1585.24s)]
*  go into Gaza? Like there are strategic things that have changed for the Israeli army. Is the Israeli [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1589.4s)]
*  army going to go into Lebanon? I mean the same thing happened in Lebanon in 2006. They tried a [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1595.48s)]
*  ground invasion. They came up the hill and were stopped in their tracks, turned around, went back [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1601.64s)]
*  down, and then they, if you remember, shelled and cluster bombed all those areas that they couldn't [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1606.84s)]
*  go in on the ground to. So there's history with this. There's always history with this. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1611.8s)]
*  Yes. And remember just was I think yesterday as we're speaking, Netanyahu summoned all the foreign [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1617.88s)]
*  ambassadors to an auditorium in order to justify this massacre that's going on in Gaza. And he [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1628.1200000000001s)]
*  actually said, you know, there's two strategies with Gaza. One is deterrence, which is what we're [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1636.7600000000002s)]
*  doing now, which means kill men, women, and children until the natives get it into their [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1644.2s)]
*  heads that there's no point resisting. And the other is conquering Gaza. And he said that's not [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1651.24s)]
*  off the table. So that was reported as a threat to launch a ground invasion. But to me that came off [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1658.28s)]
*  precisely as you said, John, as bluster and desperation because Israel is unable to achieve [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1667.8s)]
*  what it wants to achieve, which is, you know, the defeat and submission of the Palestinians [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1677.0s)]
*  through this bombardment. And earlier when Israel had threatened a ground invasion or made [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1683.16s)]
*  you know, motions towards a ground invasion, like moving troops around Gaza or authorizing the call [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1690.92s)]
*  up of reserves, the Qassam Brigades actually made a statement. And I think that the Islamic Jihad's [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1698.12s)]
*  military wing made a similar statement saying, you know, come on, do it. I think Qassam said [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1706.76s)]
*  you invading Gaza is our shortest route to victory. And I think it's very significant that [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1713.32s)]
*  there are no serious demands in Israel, even from the far right. Yeah, of course, there are the far, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1722.52s)]
*  far right people who say flatten Gaza, level Gaza, but there are really no credible calls [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1728.52s)]
*  from anyone in Israel for a ground operation in Gaza. There would be a mutiny. The army is not [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1735.0s)]
*  going in and fighting in a dense urban environment that has got a subway system of tunnels under it. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1741.8s)]
*  And I just I don't see it. I mean, we could always be proven wrong within an hour of making these [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1747.72s)]
*  kind of statements. But I don't see I don't see a ground invasion as a possibility. And I mean, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1753.6399999999999s)]
*  I think we can all hope for not having a ground invasion as it's a very costly thing. But yeah, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1759.48s)]
*  the strategic dynamic has changed in the Israel-Palestine conflict and it's changed [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1767.64s)]
*  in the Israel-Hezbollah conflict. And there's those are factors that are real on the ground [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1773.88s)]
*  that just don't really get captured by the Twitter debates or the New York Times republishing [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1781.0s)]
*  Israeli sources. There's a dynamic around Israel that Israel knows. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1788.44s)]
*  And if you consider the extent of the disruption to Israel, you know, just there have been reports [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1793.0s)]
*  in the Israeli media that, you know, the psychological helplines like can't cope with [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1801.56s)]
*  the demand. And, you know, there was a member of the Knesset who said we have to provide emergency [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1806.36s)]
*  funding for psychological health because the Israeli population is collectively having a nervous [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1812.04s)]
*  breakdown from, you know, what they're going through, which is, you know, I'm not going to say [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1817.32s)]
*  it's not frightening for people to be in this situation. It's of course a tiny fraction of what [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1823.32s)]
*  Palestinians in Gaza are put through all the time, not even just now when the heavy bombing is going. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1829.48s)]
*  But I think Israelis know that what they're facing now from Gaza is not just the Israeli [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1836.4399999999998s)]
*  population, but the whole world. And I think that what's happening now from Gaza is still a fraction [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1845.48s)]
*  of what would happen in a full-scale conflict with Hezbollah. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1852.84s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Or a full-scale conflict with Hamas. I mean, they've been developing for seven [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1859.72s)]
*  years since the last one, Islamic Jihad and Hamas and the Joint Operations Room. I mean, there's all [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1864.52s)]
*  kinds of capabilities that we know they have that we haven't seen as much of. We know that they have [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1870.2s)]
*  the entire frogman unit that we haven't heard anything about in part because Israel's left [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1875.08s)]
*  their bases all around. They've left them open. They used to just sit like a massive parking lot. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1881.48s)]
*  Outside of Gaza used to look like a used car parking lot for tanks. They would all muster there, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1886.84s)]
*  and now they're not there at all. And the footage from the first day when they were doing all of [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1893.0s)]
*  the things that they normally do when one of these flare-up starts, the first thing you see in Israel [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1899.72s)]
*  is truck after truck, flatbed truck carrying tanks down to the border. Well, the tank didn't [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1904.68s)]
*  even get unloaded off the truck, and it got hit by a cornet. The pictures of it on the back of [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1909.72s)]
*  the truck smoking. And that was the last of their input of the normally dozens and dozens of tanks [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1915.3200000000002s)]
*  that they put in on the ground. There's lots of little clues that Israel's offering that [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1922.2s)]
*  they don't want the conflict and where the poking of the holes in the tunnels that they've been doing [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1927.72s)]
*  the nature of a tunnel is that it has many entrances all through it. That's the potency [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1934.68s)]
*  of the tunnel. It's not just a straight line. And so when you poke a spike on the border [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1941.24s)]
*  and you cut through a tunnel that somebody has dug with a hand trowel at great personal effect, [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1947.0s)]
*  those tunnels, you can't, those tunnels could be rebuilt around the spike that goes in and interrupts [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1955.4s)]
*  it quite easily by just detour, like just doing a little detour around it. And you keep the exact, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1966.6000000000001s)]
*  the Israelis are calling it a metro. In Canada, we call it a subway, but you're talking about a [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1974.68s)]
*  massive system under the ground. Pinpricking one part of that system isn't ruining the system. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1979.64s)]
*  And maybe the border ability for them to come out and grab soldiers on the border is limited, [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1986.92s)]
*  but a ground war, the tunnels are under the entire ground war. I just don't see it happening. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1992.5200000000002s)]
*  I can confirm from my own experience when I went to Gaza in 2013, the only time I've [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=1999.16s)]
*  been able to go to Gaza, we were able to go and visit tunnels on the Rafah border. Now, [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2006.28s)]
*  these were commercial tunnels. They weren't military tunnels, obviously, but we still required, [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2014.36s)]
*  these are not just open for anyone to go to. And we weren't allowed to take pictures. I was with [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2020.36s)]
*  other journalists and people in Gaza. And it was incredible because we were taken to one of the [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2025.56s)]
*  large tunnels that was like, you have to imagine a very wide, vertical circular shaft with a [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2033.24s)]
*  platform, a lift platform. And at the ground level, you go onto the platform and this is a circular [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2042.6s)]
*  platform that you could park two cars on side by side. And then it was like incredibly engineered. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2049.48s)]
*  There was like rails down the vertical shaft of the tunnel. And then, you know, they pressed a [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2057.0s)]
*  button. There was a warning horn so that, you know, a safety horn so that people would be away [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2062.52s)]
*  from the edges where the moving parts are. And then we went down on this platform. I don't know [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2068.04s)]
*  how exactly, how far we went down, but when you looked up, like the sky was just a little hole. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2074.2s)]
*  And then there was a horizontal tunnel, which would have been going straight through to Egypt. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2080.44s)]
*  And that horizontal tunnel was just big enough to drive a car through. You know, [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2086.6s)]
*  it's not like a traffic tunnel size, but you could drive a car through it. And it had [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2094.6s)]
*  lighting all the way and it had bracing. So, you know, I think there was steel, [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2101.16s)]
*  in that particular tunnel, there was like steel bracing and there was electricity running across, [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2108.2799999999997s)]
*  along it with lighting. We walked a certain distance into it, obviously not all the way [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2114.04s)]
*  to Egypt, but it was astounding. If you had told me about this, you know, I'd heard stories about [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2119.48s)]
*  it, but I thought these are sort of fanciful stories. I would not have entirely believed it [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2126.84s)]
*  unless I'd seen it with my own eyes. It was incredible. And, but that was a commercial tunnel. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2132.92s)]
*  Now you have to imagine what is under the whole Gaza Strip and deep under the whole [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2139.64s)]
*  Gaza Strip. In other words, you know, I'm not a military strategist, but I can't imagine that [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2145.72s)]
*  you would put your most valuable assets right at the edge of the Gaza Strip. You're going to put [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2151.48s)]
*  that stuff, you know, deep, deep under Gaza and deep into Gaza. But what it told me, what I can [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2158.52s)]
*  infer from that is that there is a capability in Gaza to build very significant underground [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2167.88s)]
*  structures and assets that Israel will never be able to reach. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2177.88s)]
*  Right. And it's true. And that's what they're doing. And I mean, they got it from Hezbollah [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2182.28s)]
*  in 2006 that did that too. It was not just that they had tunnels to access Israeli troops. It's [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2185.8s)]
*  that they had tunnels to protect their own troops, that they had barracks underneath there. So troops [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2190.84s)]
*  didn't have to come up. They have meeting rooms and the capacity and the directions and the [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2197.8s)]
*  understanding of the landscape from underneath, it just turns everything that Israel thought that [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2206.92s)]
*  it was doing with its like geospatial stuff, just turns it on its head, right? They know where every [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2212.84s)]
*  building is. They know where every floor is. But there's this thing underneath the ground that [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2218.52s)]
*  I just think it prevents when they're training. Can you imagine training for those tunnel [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2224.2s)]
*  operations? Like, it's your turn. You go down, check and see where it ends. There's no good way [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2230.2799999999997s)]
*  of doing it. And on the other hand, the Palestinians have the subway map. They know where they can go [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2237.64s)]
*  to access everything at any moment when any attack comes in on the border. I just think that the [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2244.52s)]
*  strategic calculus has changed too much. And yeah, and like what you were saying about the [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2249.96s)]
*  summer holidays, Ali, is super important because it's very important for Israel to have this [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2257.4s)]
*  tourism industry. It's very important for Israel to have this be on, you know, to not be interrupted. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2262.6s)]
*  And so what they did was they built, after the 2014 war where they couldn't have planes land, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2270.12s)]
*  they've been working on their airport at a lot to make it an international airport so that you [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2276.52s)]
*  won't interrupt the flow. So then they did that. And when whatever day it was last week, Thursday [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2281.8s)]
*  or whatever, when the Israelis said that they were not flying planes, they were going to send them [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2287.64s)]
*  instead to a lot. Because Sam pulled out their longest range rocket filed, fired a 250 kilometer [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2291.7200000000003s)]
*  rocket that puts a lot in range that was there, you know, like there didn't they didn't show at [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2299.4s)]
*  the beginning of the war like, oh, look at all the tools that we have, you know, the idea that [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2304.2s)]
*  we're hearing in the Israeli media that like, oh, they knocked out entire, you know, cornet, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2309.3199999999997s)]
*  anti tank missile units, or that they're shutting down borders. There's, there's very little evidence [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2315.08s)]
*  of that. It's very crude military disinformation, I think, I think it is more and more desperate. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2322.04s)]
*  And that that airport, by the way, I have not been to to it. But actually, when you drive down, [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2328.52s)]
*  as I did in was in 2019, down to Aqaba from Amman in Jordan, down the Dead Sea Road, you [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2335.16s)]
*  you pass that airport, because it's just on the other side of the border. And it looks like a [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2345.0s)]
*  terrible place to have an airport because on one side, you know, so on the west side, a high [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2350.7599999999998s)]
*  mountains, you know, there's the there's high mountains that Israel only has a narrow strip [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2357.24s)]
*  of flat land between the mountains and the Jordanian border. So on one side, you have these high [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2363.9599999999996s)]
*  mountains. And on the other side, you have the Jordanian border. So when you're driving down [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2370.3599999999997s)]
*  the road in Jordan, you're just looking across at the Israeli airport. And they've built these very [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2374.6s)]
*  high walls around the airport. It's very strange to think that of an airport like you probably want [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2381.4s)]
*  an airport to be unobstructed. But there are these very high walls around the airport to, [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2387.88s)]
*  I assume, to kind of present to protect it from missile attacks or whatever. So [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2396.04s)]
*  it seems very and I think it's named after isn't it named after the Israeli astronaut who [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2403.7200000000003s)]
*  have to check that but I think it's named after the Israeli astronaut who died on the [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2411.8s)]
*  Columbia, the space shuttle. But yeah, so it just doesn't seem very ideal to have the airport there [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2417.0s)]
*  nor really a viable alternative to, you know, Ben Gurion Airport. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2425.48s)]
*  And then of course, if they tried to put one in the north, then you know, you're well within the [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2434.04s)]
*  range of Lebanon. So I think it's fascinating to, you know, we're not really used to [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2439.72s)]
*  thinking about Israel as I think for many years, Israel did convince people that it is invincible [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2449.24s)]
*  and invulnerable. And what these conflagrations show us is really it shows kind of the weaknesses [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2458.8399999999997s)]
*  and the resistance in Gaza have nothing but time to study Israel's weaknesses. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2468.52s)]
*  Yeah, I think we've really seen that with the political response as well and the media response [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2474.68s)]
*  is sort of a new sense of desperation in the tone. Like as we're filming this, as we were [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2480.68s)]
*  filming this earlier, Gilad Erdan, the Israeli ambassador to the United States and the UN, [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2488.2s)]
*  was speaking to the UN General Assembly and I'm gonna have to, you know, see what he said exactly, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2494.92s)]
*  but I could see that he was holding up, they were doing their usual trick of holding up the, [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2502.84s)]
*  you know, the placards and the illustrations in the UN. And he was holding up, he was trying, [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2507.6400000000003s)]
*  first of all, he was showing up a quote from the Hamas's charter. And secondly, then he was showing [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2514.92s)]
*  a picture from inside what looked to me to be a picture from inside the Al Aqsa Mosque, [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2523.48s)]
*  you know, and he was trying to say, essentially, he was trying to say, you know, these were [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2530.92s)]
*  Palestinian rioters and something along those sort of lines and to try and justify Israel's attacks [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2534.04s)]
*  on the Al Aqsa Mosque on worshippers during the Holy month of Ramadan. And I'm just seeing like, [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2542.92s)]
*  I mean, this is, I mean, this is a point for both John and Ali to address. Like, have you seen this [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2549.48s)]
*  sort of sense of desperateness from the Israeli politicians and Israeli propagandists where they're [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2557.0s)]
*  sort of saying like, why don't you believe us, you know, I saw also I saw a tweet, I think it was [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2562.44s)]
*  yesterday or the day before, for one of the official Israeli accounts, I think it was the [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2568.28s)]
*  Israeli army camp, where it was putting a video and talking about Hamas and saying, you know, [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2572.52s)]
*  the usual sort of thing, there was this terrorist organization and so forth. And the, the caption [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2580.92s)]
*  at the beginning said, if you don't believe us, then believe Hamas when they say this. So there's [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2587.08s)]
*  this real sense of like, no one's listening to us. You've seen that too? I saw that. And that [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2594.04s)]
*  struck me exactly the same way. But also another thing with that, you know, of course, [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2600.44s)]
*  you know, social media is important. And you know, it's it is mass media now. So I don't think we can [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2607.64s)]
*  dismiss it. But it was interesting, people were pointing out the contrast between the official [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2613.8s)]
*  at Israel Twitter account in Arabic, and the one in English, the one in Arabic tweeted this just [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2621.88s)]
*  horrific thing. They tweeted a verse from the Quran over a picture of, you know, a building in [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2629.72s)]
*  Gaza exploding to kind of taunt, you know, it was talking about the divine vengeance. And it was, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2636.4399999999996s)]
*  it was really to taunt Palestinians as they were killing them and to incite religious conflict and [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2643.56s)]
*  war, because I think Israel thinks they benefit from this being seen as a religious war. Whereas [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2650.8399999999997s)]
*  the English account was tweeting like, guys, it's been a tough week for us, but we love you. Thank [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2656.76s)]
*  you for all the support with lots of emojis. So I can't remember who was on Twitter who pointed out [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2664.6000000000004s)]
*  the contrast that there's like this, this, you know, religious fanaticism on one account, and [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2670.1200000000003s)]
*  then tweeting like an hurt teenager on the other account. And you just get the sense that Israel is, [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2676.44s)]
*  is desperate is just throwing everything out there and seeing what sticks, you know. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2683.5600000000004s)]
*  And I do sense a change that this, that the demonizing propaganda that Israel relied on for [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2689.2400000000002s)]
*  so, so long, especially in the years right after 9 11, that you could reliably demonize Muslims, [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2697.0800000000004s)]
*  all you had to do is say, look, their name is Islamic Jihad, what more do you need to know about [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2703.4s)]
*  them? And people would immediately be on Israel's side, but that's not working anymore. And [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2708.28s)]
*  for, you know, given that ultimately, you know, as I point out, South Africa, apartheid South [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2716.36s)]
*  Africa was never militarily defeated. You know, it always retained immense military domination [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2726.28s)]
*  over the ANC over the black population, it could have massacred them at will. And it did massacre [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2734.2s)]
*  them on many occasions. But it lost the legitimacy war, it lost the propaganda war. And once the [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2740.52s)]
*  regime loses any legitimacy, then all the weapons in the world will really not help you. And I [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2747.56s)]
*  really think that that is the crisis Israel is in, you know, as John is pointing out, tanks are of [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2754.68s)]
*  no use in a situation like this. You know, you can have all the tanks in the world. It doesn't help [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2762.36s)]
*  you in a battle for international legitimacy. And in fact, it hurts you if you're seen as being this, [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2768.84s)]
*  you know, military, military occupier and colonizer that's just blasting the indigenous people, [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2778.28s)]
*  it actually turns out to be worse. So it's hard to predict. Obviously, we can't, [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2784.9199999999996s)]
*  we don't have a crystal ball. But what we see, I think, in this past 10 days, is really an [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2796.4399999999996s)]
*  intensification and confirmation of all of these trends we've been talking about that are not new, [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2802.7599999999998s)]
*  but have been happening for years. And I think now, you know, possibly reaching a tipping point. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2808.84s)]
*  I do think that as a result of this, like, BDS is going to become mainstream in a way that it [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2815.8s)]
*  hasn't before. And I think that, you know, mainstream politicians are going to start, [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2822.04s)]
*  and public figures and celebrities and so on, are going to start endorsing boycott, [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2828.84s)]
*  where they would not have dared to do so, you know, a few months by I don't know if that's [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2834.84s)]
*  in your field of analysis, john, but I'd love to hear what you think about that, too. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2840.76s)]
*  Well, I mean, I think there's a lot of interesting things about the ceasefire, [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2845.56s)]
*  because the 2014 ceasefire negotiations were invalidated by Israel. So it'd be interesting [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2848.6800000000003s)]
*  to see with new leadership in Hamas, and this connection with the Kassam Brigades in the top [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2857.96s)]
*  leadership positions, how the blockade will factor into these negotiations, because at this point, [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2863.7999999999997s)]
*  with the West Bank on fire, 48, possibly rising up, Israel may not be the one to decide how this [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2871.8799999999997s)]
*  ceasefire goes. And it was interesting, I think, to look to see towards the way that Hamas deals [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2879.56s)]
*  with the blockade, because when we say nothing changes from these wars, a lot could change from [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2886.04s)]
*  these wars with very little, we don't have to have a whole political overthrow to have very [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2891.88s)]
*  significant improvements on life in Gaza, and the blockade. And I'm curious to see how the 2014 [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2898.6800000000003s)]
*  failure to do that, to failure to live up to that by Israel will color someone like Yahuasinwar, [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2907.7200000000003s)]
*  who's spent, you know, decades in Israeli jails, you know, he said he had an interesting quote about [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2915.32s)]
*  the great marches from a couple years ago, and he said they were like, when we were in prison, [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2920.84s)]
*  we did a hunger strike. The hunger strike forced the Israelis to negotiate. That was the point of [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2927.4s)]
*  the hunger strike, to force a negotiation. He said during the great return marches, when people were [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2932.6800000000003s)]
*  walking to the lines and getting massacred, he said, this is what you're seeing here is a people [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2938.04s)]
*  calling for negotiations, like people, this is how we do it, resisting with dignity, with honor, [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2945.48s)]
*  calling for negotiations. So it is a different way that they see it. And it's something that's [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2952.12s)]
*  definitely not going to be in our newspapers a lot. But it I think it'll be an important factor [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2959.32s)]
*  on the ground, because you have people involved to now really have fought these struggles, you know, [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2964.44s)]
*  not that the previous leadership didn't, of course, they did. But from Israeli jail for [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2973.24s)]
*  your whole life, you know, Sinwar said that they thought the jail was our graveyard, but it was our [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2977.8799999999997s)]
*  academy. Now, this is the guy who's coming out, I think that the way he handles the ceasefire [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2983.4799999999996s)]
*  negotiations are going to be very, very interesting. And normally, I would make jokes about ceasefires [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2991.08s)]
*  about how they last for two days, and then we'll go another UN meeting. And we're gonna write, but [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=2996.3599999999997s)]
*  it's possible that that there's a new day in Gaza. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=3001.8s)]
*  I certainly hope so. Yeah, no kidding. We only have the blockade. I mean, that needs to be that [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=3008.36s)]
*  needs to be it's almost like it's gone on so long, people forget that that is a thing that is, [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=3016.84s)]
*  you know, on top of mind for everybody, especially when we see all of these things [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=3022.2000000000003s)]
*  that are being destroyed, like the civilian infrastructure, the civil infrastructure, [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=3027.96s)]
*  the libraries, the hospitals, the schools, blockade has to end. It has that what has to come out of [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=3031.96s)]
*  this is the is an end to the blockade. I think that's a good place to leave it. John Elmer, [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAML3n5GaDU&t=3040.04s)]
