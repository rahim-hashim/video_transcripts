Video Description: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs beyond doubt that the world has raised its voice. The world has condemned what the Zionist entity is doing, and not a single politician in a position of authority has lifted a finger to stop it,‚Äù educator, writer and essayist Steven Salaita says.
Salaita, who now lives in Cairo, Egypt, spoke with Tamara Nassar about moral clarity and the emboldening of political principles as Israel‚Äôs genocide of Palestinians in Gaza nears its five-month mark.
‚ÄúAnd in fact, rather than stopping it, they have aided it and abetted it and funded it and justified it. So we have to be serious now. Where does that leave us? What options do we have?‚Äù Salaita continued.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have the answers at the moment. A lot of answers are emerging and will continue to emerge from Gaza itself, but I do know where we cannot look anymore.‚Äù
Salaita is the author of eight books, including Uncivil Rites and Inter/Nationalism: Decolonizing Native America and Palestine.
Following multiple public controversies and a brief departure from academe, Salaita is now a professor at the Department of English and Comparative Literature at the University of Cairo. 
Nassar asked Salaita if the Arab American community remains under any illusion that the Biden administration or the Democratic Party are outlets through which they can be heard, especially with the US Presidential elections coming up in November.

# US elections and the lesser evil of genocide, with Steven Salaita | EI Podcast
**The Electronic Intifada:** [February 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo)
*  Welcome back to the Electronic Intifada podcast. I am Tamar Nassar. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=0.0s)]
*  I am joined today by a very special guest, writer and essayist, Stephen Salaita. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=5.0s)]
*  Salaita is the author of eight books, including Uncivil Rights and Internationalism, Decolonizing Native America and Palestine. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=12.0s)]
*  His forthcoming memoir, titled An Honest Living, a Memoir of Peculiar Itineraries, will be published by Fordham University Press next month. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=23.0s)]
*  Salaita writes of his departure from academia following multiple controversies, which we will talk about later in the show. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=35.0s)]
*  Salaita is now a professor at the Department of English and Comparative Literature at the American University in Cairo. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=46.0s)]
*  Stephen, welcome back to the show. I am glad to be speaking with you today. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=57.0s)]
*  It's an honor. Thank you for having me. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=62.0s)]
*  Stephen, your self-published website is a treasure trove of brilliantly written essays, stevensalaita.com, No Flags, No Slogans. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=66.0s)]
*  And you wrote one piece that I'd like to talk about. It's titled Scrolling Through Genocide. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=77.0s)]
*  Zionist massacres are live-streamed to the masses in high definition and still nobody can stop them. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=84.0s)]
*  I would like to quote from that piece. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=91.0s)]
*  It has become clear during the past two months in the Gaza Strip that the Zionist entity is plenty capable of equaling the belligerence of the American frontier. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=96.0s)]
*  An era of wholesale ethnic cleansing thought to be a feature of history. It could never happen today. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=106.0s)]
*  People sometimes would foolishly declare. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=112.0s)]
*  Colonial atrocities of the past, wounded knee, sand creek, the Trail of Tears, are now everywhere in evidence. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=115.0s)]
*  The Zionist entity is carrying out a kind of primitive violence with modern technology. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=122.0s)]
*  This violence fills our computer and television screens. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=128.0s)]
*  People around the world get minute by minute accounts of massive destruction and widespread murder. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=132.0s)]
*  Certain images have become horrifyingly familiar. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=138.0s)]
*  Thongs of refugees queuing for bread. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=142.0s)]
*  Ambulances dodging tank and machine gun fire. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=145.0s)]
*  Hospitals in disarray. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=149.0s)]
*  Once dense neighborhoods transformed by aerial bombardment into kilometers of rubble. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=152.0s)]
*  We scroll through photos of men blindfolded and stripped to their underwear, lined up on the ground like antiquities in a museum courtyard. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=157.0s)]
*  The scrolling continues into pictures of white body bags in shallow trenches and then into videos of little girls and boys screaming trauma into the ruins of their childhood. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=167.0s)]
*  We are perhaps the first generation to witness genocide in real time. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=178.0s)]
*  History books about the horrors of the past are written every time somebody opens social media. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=183.0s)]
*  So, Stephen, we are in the fifth month of this genocide. You wrote this earlier. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=189.0s)]
*  We've protested. We've written about it. We've collected testimonies. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=195.0s)]
*  We, people have gone to the International Court of Justice. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=201.0s)]
*  We've called our lawmakers. We boycotted. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=206.0s)]
*  In the case of Jordan, we even tried to approach the border. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=210.0s)]
*  We tried to get people out. We tried to block major roads and major metropoles. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=213.0s)]
*  We've come out in the hundreds of thousands, globally in the millions. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=220.0s)]
*  And the truth of the matter is none of us have been able to stop this madness. It's ongoing. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=225.0s)]
*  We are forever changed by this. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=232.0s)]
*  The world also feels changed by this. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=236.0s)]
*  But I think the scariest part is that it isn't. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=238.0s)]
*  That the world feels in a very dark way capable of forgetting this, capable of ignoring it, capable of inventing even a much worse way to keep executing this. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=244.0s)]
*  And the reality for Palestinians in Gaza just keeps getting worse and worse day by day. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=260.0s)]
*  And the bombs have not stopped. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=265.0s)]
*  I don't know what it is I want to ask you other than to respond and talk about this feeling of helplessness, given that we all somehow believed that maybe being able to see it would mean we would be able to stop it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=268.0s)]
*  But that's been proven not to be the case. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=290.0s)]
*  Yeah, you said it extremely powerfully and movingly. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=293.0s)]
*  I mean, I think you've articulated something that's been bothering a whole lot of people in a really profound way. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=302.0s)]
*  And the way that I'm trying to approach, I don't know if anybody listening would find it helpful. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=315.0s)]
*  To some degree, we resigned ourselves to the reality that, you know, we're doing what we can do in the day to day. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=324.0s)]
*  What we think might help, but short of entering into Gaza and taking up arms, it just seems like a bunch of bullshit. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=334.0s)]
*  That's what it very often feels like. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=348.0s)]
*  But it is, I try to remember that it is important to document and to speak and to make sure that people aren't allowed to get too comfortable. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=350.0s)]
*  And we're writing history in our own way when we condemn this genocide, when we refuse to let the Zionist narrative go unchallenged, when we hold our supposed allies accountable and tell them this isn't good enough, you need to do better. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=361.0s)]
*  Again, none of this stuff is physically going to stop the genocide, but there is still a world outside of the genocide that needs to reckon with what is happening inside of Gaza. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=383.0s)]
*  And that's what our role can be. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=395.0s)]
*  I don't want to say that anything positive is ever going to come out of this. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=399.0s)]
*  I don't see anything potentially positive in the future. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=406.0s)]
*  All I see is a lot of death and suffering, immeasurable suffering, incomprehensible suffering. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=410.0s)]
*  But I hope it will allow more people to embrace the very evident reality that all of these narratives about Western democracy and Western free speech that they might have believed or in a lot of cases repeated in various ways is a whole lot of bullshit. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=418.0s)]
*  It doesn't exist. There is no democracy. If there were democracy in any Western country, its government would have been held, their governments would have been held to account already. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=446.0s)]
*  Obviously there's no democracy in the Zionist entity. That's out of the question now. Anybody who says that moving forward is not a serious human being and is more likely a ghoul. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=455.0s)]
*  But we cannot rely or put our lives in the hands of civic institutions, in the hands of politicians. They've all turned their backs on us. AOC turned her back on Palestinians. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=467.0s)]
*  Bernie Sanders turned his back on Palestinians. The US government writ large has turned its back on Palestinians. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=487.0s)]
*  So you think about all the energy and all the effort people have put into these institutions as some sort of guarantor of democracy or some sort of guarantor of just the basic right to live has ended up being wasted. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=495.0s)]
*  And it's hard to think about. It's hard to come to terms with, but we must. We cannot look towards the usual civic institutions, NGOs, elections, these sorts of things. Those days are done. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=511.0s)]
*  Our lives are in our hands and our ability to live is staked on our relationships with one another, not on governments, not on politicians, not on anything. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=531.0s)]
*  Gaza has proved that. A lot of people thought it before, but now it's beyond doubt that the world has raised its voice. The world has condemned what the Zionist entity is doing and not a single politician in a position of authority has lifted a finger to stop it. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=547.0s)]
*  And in fact, rather than stopping it, they have aided it and abetted it and funded it and justified it. And so we have to be serious now. Where does that leave us? What options do we have? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=571.0s)]
*  I don't have the answers at the moment. A lot of the answers are emerging and will continue to emerge from Gaza itself, but I do know where we cannot look anymore. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=585.0s)]
*  And that is that the the specific institutions that claim to be focused on human rights and democracy, because quite clearly everybody was lied to. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=598.0s)]
*  That's right. And I think you make a very good point about US politicians, but I would go a step further and say that the lines that have been emboldened ever since this started have made things a lot clearer. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=608.0s)]
*  Americans will be heading to the voting booths in November to elect a new US president. Of course, the sitting president has now come to be known as Genocide Joe or Butcher Biden. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=621.0s)]
*  He can hardly make a public appearance without being protested or heckled or shouted at. And while Biden is still in office, he's still in office. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=635.0s)]
*  And while Biden and his secretary of state, Anthony Blinken, can hide behind the theater of feeling sorry and diplomacy and to give the illusion that the United States is trying to broker a ceasefire, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=650.0s)]
*  In reality, the United States is waging this genocide on Palestinians. Even if the airstrikes on Gaza are being carried out by Israeli hands, it is the United States that is trying to stop the war. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=665.0s)]
*  In reality, the United States is waging this genocide on Palestinians. Even if the airstrikes on Gaza are being carried out by Israeli hands, it is the United States only that holds the power to seize the supply of weapons to Israel at any moment, forcing an end to this genocide. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=680.0s)]
*  The Biden administration, to put it very plainly and very simply, is an enemy of the Palestinian people. And we're at a point where the Gaza Strip is just completely unrecognizable than it looked like before. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=705.0s)]
*  80% of the infrastructure and the buildings have been either completely destroyed or damaged. And still, the Biden administration and its mouthpieces, like you mentioned, AOC, the Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Fortez, are already trying to gaslight people, not just Arab Americans, but all kinds of self-described people. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=722.0s)]
*  Self-described progressives and liberals in the United States into voting for Biden because scary orange man Donald Trump. And you wrote about this. You touched on the Arab American community in a piece that's titled, Arab Americans Won't Be Shamed into Voting for Joe Biden. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=751.0s)]
*  And I'm going to quote you again because you're just a brilliant writer and everyone should go to your website and read your work for themselves. But you write, no matter what individual Arab Americans choose to do in the privacy of the voting booth or from the privacy of our homes, the tired and tiresome tactic of lesser evil, browbeating and public discourse will not persuade us to forget about Palestine. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=781.0s)]
*  Tell us about reproductive rights, all you want. We know about the women in Gaza who endured C-sections without anesthesia. Tell us about the future of our children, all you want. We've already seen the dead babies in abandoned incubators. Tell us about loan relief, all you want. We've already counted the billions this government sends to Israel. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=811.0s)]
*  And you write some more and then you say, tell us about Big Bats, Kerry Trump, all you want. Nobody in this moment looks more callous and evil than Joseph R. Biden. And while this is very clear and the genocide is not even over, we see, you know, leading progressives like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=833.0s)]
*  I mean, she went on a podcast called I've Had It and it's just, it's two, you know, ladies who, in a more casual setting who interviewed her and, you know, they ask her the question, they say Joe Biden hit it or had it. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=861.0s)]
*  And she very enthusiastically says hit it. And she says, you know, there are plenty of things that the president has done that I disagree with. But, you know, almost, you know, she says at the end of the day, you know, brushing off her like fleeting mention of an act of genocide that this president is waging. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=882.0s)]
*  She says at the end of the day, we just have to be adults in the room and we cannot allow this fascist government movement to grow in this country. And she verbatim says that the decision to vote for Biden, quote, is not a difficult one for me. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=899.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't want to ask you to make speculations and predictions. I think like, you know, there's all sorts of things can happen between now and November. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=913.0s)]
*  We can, you know, we can speculate until our eyes turn blue. I don't think it's useful. The Democrats can even come up with a new front runner from their genie house. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=923.0s)]
*  So who knows what will happen. But do you think that the lesser evil argument will go far in the future? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=933.0s)]
*  Or is the mask completely off? Because I mean, and ultimately, I'd like to mention that this is, you know, I'm aware that we're talking about the mask, but I think that the mask is a little bit more of a [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=942.0s)]
*  And to anyone in the global South who's listening, ultimately, the difference between Republican and Democrats is the difference between a wolf in wolf's clothing and a wolf dressed as a sheep. It does not matter how you dress it. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=966.82s)]
*  The empire and its blood trail has been tightening its noose around this globe for as long as anyone can remember. But if we were to entertain this inside baseball here for a second, what are your thoughts on this? What are the stakes? Because it seems that the Democrats never learn their lesson. So. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=988.82s)]
*  I want to apologize before I get going both to you, Tamara, and to our listeners, because I'm feeling rather an urge to rant. And sometimes that that that urge is difficult to hold back. I even was writing some notes as you were talking like, so I'm putting an outline to my rant. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1012.82s)]
*  Because I think you're really getting to the meat of things and and I don't know, I have, I have a lot to say about it. So I'll try to be concise and and organized and maybe even articulate. I have no ability to do election prognostication and not many people even people who have made the [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1033.82s)]
*  significant sum of money doing election prognostication, you know, have proved not very good at it. Nate Silver and all those dorks, right? They didn't mean anything else, anything more than just your average person, you know, shopping in Walmart. But I do have a pretty strong feeling as regards to the Arab and Muslim American communities.

*  I don't think they're gonna be convinced. I'm interested to see what Rasheeda Tlaib will do in October, whether she's going to start to caping for Biden or not and whether she holds out and, you know, decides not to endorse him, or whether she, you know, concedes and ends up endorsing him as the election approaches, I don't know what she's gonna do but I think that will have some effect on the election process. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1089.18s)]

*  Make whatever decision you want, but you have to bear that in mind and you have to take [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1313.14s)]
*  that reality seriously. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1317.02s)]

*  And I don't think it does anybody any good to pretend anymore that we have a voice and [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1323.5800000000002s)]
*  we have a say in how this government makes its decisions, because obviously we don't. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1329.9s)]
*  The numbers are there. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1335.06s)]
*  Democrats are overwhelmingly against this genocide and overwhelmingly in favor of a [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1336.86s)]

*  So whatever they say, in effect, they're continuing to support the genocide, because as you say, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1354.94s)]

*  but I ran out of patience a long time ago. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1371.42s)]
*  When AOC won her primary, I don't know what, 2018, 2019, I don't remember, but before she [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1376.94s)]

*  ensured that she would win the congressional seat because there was no Republican challenger [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1388.54s)]
*  worth mentioning, she gave an interview a few days after that primary where she started [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1392.94s)]
*  doing some wishy-washy bullshit about Palestine. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1399.42s)]
*  I picked up on it. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1403.02s)]
*  I wrote a post just transcribing what she had said and left it there. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1404.74s)]
*  And I got absolutely dogfiled by everybody. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1408.7s)]
*  But there was a principle there and I want to reemphasize that principle with apologies [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1412.86s)]
*  to those who already are aware of this principle and practice it. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1417.7s)]
*  When a politician or a celebrity activist or a celebrity academic or somebody in some sort [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1422.14s)]
*  of position of power, materially or discursively, chose what we all recognize to be some [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1429.74s)]

*  not because we're purists, it's not because we're assholes, it's because we've seen it a [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1446.34s)]
*  million times and we know exactly what the hell that means. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1450.74s)]

*  I got killed. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1490.18s)]

*  Everybody's writing articles. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1495.42s)]

*  Well, what happens when the genocide? [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1499.38s)]
*  The point is when somebody shows themselves to be a Zionist, it's only when shit hits the [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1501.14s)]
*  fan and when stuff really matters, you're going to see what side they take. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1506.66s)]
*  Right? [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1510.66s)]
*  When the bombs start flying and there's a choice to make, they're going to make the [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1511.22s)]
*  choice. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1514.42s)]
*  So I take absolutely no pleasure in calling out people's soft Zionism or their liberal [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1515.42s)]
*  Zionism or their wishy washyness. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1519.98s)]
*  But it's only because I know, just like so many of us know, that there's going to come [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1522.14s)]

*  have chosen them. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1531.14s)]
*  People need to be aware of that. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1532.42s)]
*  We're seeing that with AOC. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1533.74s)]
*  She made it evident before she even sat in her congressional seat that she was going to [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1536.14s)]
*  sell Palestine down the river. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1540.98s)]

*  What does she do? [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1543.86s)]
*  She sold Palestine down the river. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1544.42s)]
*  All right. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1546.14s)]
*  Bernie told us over and over and over again that his loyalty ultimately lies with some [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1546.78s)]
*  variation of a Jewish state. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1551.54s)]
*  Genocide happens. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1553.98s)]
*  Whose side does he take? [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1555.3s)]
*  Not yours. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1556.5800000000002s)]
*  All right. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1557.7s)]
*  You know, your uncle probably, real uncle probably would have taken your side, but Amo [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1558.7s)]
*  Bernie, he didn't. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1562.5s)]
*  He took the side of the genocide heir. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1564.14s)]
*  So all of this is a, I'm going to wrap up, I promise. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1566.2600000000002s)]
*  This is a roundabout way of saying that what you're seeing now in Gaza is a culmination [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1570.98s)]
*  of a process wherein the depth of people's Zionist sensibilities are being made manifest [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1579.5800000000002s)]

*  that this person is not to be trusted, that in the moment of truth, this person is not [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1600.22s)]

*  colony. They make it manifest every time. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1609.5800000000002s)]
*  They peddle some of the nonsense that we've all heard a million times. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1613.6200000000001s)]
*  We know how to identify it. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1616.74s)]
*  All right. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1618.06s)]
*  We could make a list right now. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1618.26s)]
*  And as pertains to Biden and lesser evilism, what lesser evil? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1620.06s)]
*  What is more evil than what's going on in Gaza? [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1628.38s)]
*  I don't even want to entertain this nonsense. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1632.1799999999998s)]
*  This, you know, liberals, white liberals, particularly Zionist liberals, especially, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1636.4199999999998s)]
*  they just need to mind their own business. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1643.4599999999998s)]
*  We're watching our people be genocide. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1645.4199999999998s)]
*  We're watching our families getting killed and living in tents and starving to death. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1648.1s)]
*  We don't care what you have to say. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1653.06s)]
*  You can not tell us anything that will possibly be meaningful to us. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1655.02s)]
*  And I don't want to hear anything about Biden's anguished genocidal decision making. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1661.5s)]
*  That's a whole lot of coordinated nonsense. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1667.3799999999999s)]
*  You know, insider journalists who work for the corporate press taking their talking [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1671.1s)]
*  points from inside the White House and inside the State Department. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1676.62s)]
*  These are always bullshit stories. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1680.34s)]
*  And it doesn't even matter. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1682.06s)]
*  I mean, I want him to be anguished. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1683.34s)]
*  I want him to go to bed feeling like shit every night. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1686.3799999999999s)]
*  I want him to go to bed suffering. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1689.1s)]
*  But he's not. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1690.74s)]
*  Because you can look back at Joe Biden's record and he's always been terrible. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1691.98s)]
*  You know, it's not like this is a new phenomenon. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1696.66s)]
*  There's nothing in Joe Biden's record anywhere in his long career as a politician, as a [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1698.94s)]
*  senator and a vice president, a president that would suggest that he would do even a [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1706.42s)]
*  minimally good thing for a down-fraud community or for the oppressed. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1713.1000000000001s)]
*  It simply doesn't exist in his record. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1718.6200000000001s)]
*  And so somebody wants to tell us, you know, those of the Palestinian diaspora or those [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1722.14s)]
*  of us who have voting rights in the United States that we're morally, morally obliged [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1728.7s)]
*  or politically obliged to choose the lesser evil, then I'll say fine. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1733.3400000000001s)]
*  Then I'm morally, morally obliged and politically obliged to sit out the election [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1738.78s)]
*  altogether. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1743.8600000000001s)]
*  100 percent everything that you just said. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1748.42s)]
*  And with Rashida Tlaib, I would just like to point out that. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1753.9s)]
*  I mean, pertaining to her and Sanders and AOC, there is always this, like you said, [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1761.3400000000001s)]
*  you get piled on immediately at the mildest criticism of what they say and do as if they [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1767.38s)]
*  are the most vulnerable tokens that we have when in reality, what it comes down to is [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1774.5s)]
*  that they are US politicians, they are US lawmakers, they are some of the most powerful [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1786.18s)]
*  people in the world. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1791.86s)]
*  They sit in the most powerful halls in the world. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1793.02s)]
*  And this language of Hamu Birney and like, you know, with with Tlaib, like being Palestinian, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1796.3s)]
*  it's just all it does is. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1804.18s)]
*  Create this pseudo familiarity between these people, these very powerful people and the [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1809.22s)]
*  general public that makes it impossible to criticize them no matter what they say. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1817.1399999999999s)]
*  And, you know, Glenn Greenwald said something about AOC when she when she went on that [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1821.98s)]
*  podcast, he said that he said it's wild how in four short years, AOC went from branding [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1826.82s)]
*  herself as a major threat to the Democratic Party to becoming without hyperbole the most [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1834.58s)]
*  valuable tool, activist and spokesperson for the Democratic Party. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1840.1s)]
*  And I think that's extremely true because. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1844.78s)]
*  When you have when you are shielded by your own followers constantly from any criticism, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1849.9s)]
*  how can you ever be pushed? [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1858.26s)]
*  These people only ever listen when you push them. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1859.74s)]
*  They don't listen when you take crumbs. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1863.7s)]
*  They don't listen when you cite that one time they said something mildly satisfactory [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1865.74s)]
*  and five years ago. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1871.98s)]
*  It does not matter. I mean, AOC follows every single one of her atrocious like after she [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1875.3400000000001s)]
*  did that podcast, she goes on the House floor and she says three sentences to appease to [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1882.3400000000001s)]
*  people and they take it. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1888.7s)]
*  But Tlaib actually last week said something I think unforgivable on the House floor. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1891.46s)]
*  They were discussing. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1900.4199999999998s)]
*  They were debating Resolution 966, which purports to condemn, quote, rape and sexual [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1903.58s)]
*  violence committed by Hamas in its war against Israel. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1910.34s)]
*  And instead of challenging that, Rashidah Tlaib gave credence to Israel's fabricated [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1914.4199999999998s)]
*  atrocity propaganda, which we have the electronic Intifada and several other publications, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1921.3799999999999s)]
*  including Monde Weiss and the Grey Zone, have dismantled and shown to be just fabricated [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1929.38s)]
*  atrocity propaganda and a deliberate campaign of lies designed to justify Israel's genocide [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1943.8200000000002s)]
*  against Palestinians. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1950.7s)]
*  And she says, I'm quoting here, all acts of sexual violence are horrific. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1952.3400000000001s)]
*  We should all be fighting to end it here at home and all around the world. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1958.54s)]
*  So while the resolution on the floor today rightfully denounces any sexual violence by [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1961.86s)]
*  Hamas, I am disturbed that it's completely ignores and erases any sexual violence and [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1966.26s)]
*  abuse committed by the Israeli forces against Palestinians, especially children. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1971.62s)]
*  So I don't know what's going on in Rashidah Tlaib's head. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1975.94s)]
*  I don't know if she's aware of this being a deliberate campaign of lies and propaganda, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1978.1s)]
*  and she thinks she has to accept this in order to talk about Israeli sexual violence [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1982.74s)]
*  against Palestinian prisoners. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1988.1s)]
*  But this is to me completely unforgivable and my colleague Ali Abou Nama wrote about [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1991.74s)]
*  it, still no retraction from Rashidah Tlaib. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=1998.58s)]
*  And it's literally spreading atrocity propaganda, helping spread it, helping cement it on [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2002.02s)]
*  the house floor when there is like zero challenge to it. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2008.4199999999998s)]
*  I don't know if you have anything to say about that. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2011.54s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2020.22s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2022.42s)]
*  I agree with Ali. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2023.82s)]
*  Everybody at EI has done an absolutely phenomenal job at debunking these deeply ingrained [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2027.6599999999999s)]
*  propaganda claims. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2036.54s)]
*  And so the work you all are doing has been invaluable. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2037.82s)]
*  We were talking earlier about how we feel helpless and there's nothing we can do. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2042.7s)]
*  But I think correcting these stories and challenging this propaganda in the way that [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2046.14s)]
*  the people at EI have is supremely important and it has a lasting effect, not only in the [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2053.26s)]
*  way that we understand what's going on, but for the historical record as well, it's [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2059.46s)]
*  going to be deeply important. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2062.98s)]
*  But I don't know what Rashidah's... [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2064.06s)]
*  I don't know what her calculus is. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2067.1s)]
*  And I don't want to speak from her position without knowing everything that's happening [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2068.9s)]
*  to her life privately and professionally. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2079.66s)]
*  But I would suggest that if she is doing it, if she is saying these things because she [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2082.2999999999997s)]
*  actually believes them, then she needs to start reading EI. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2092.7s)]
*  I know that I get the sense from the past few years that she's not the biggest fan of [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2098.1s)]
*  that publication. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2104.2599999999998s)]
*  All right. I think there's been some evidence to suggest that she's not the biggest fan [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2105.2999999999997s)]
*  of Ali in particular. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2110.3399999999997s)]
*  She wasn't in the past, but she needs to educate herself. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2112.2999999999997s)]
*  She's a congressperson. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2118.5s)]
*  But if she is doing it just to play politics, and either option is viable, I really have [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2119.9s)]
*  no idea, then I would say that the only honorable thing to do is to leave that genocidal [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2125.46s)]
*  institution that you call the US Congress so you can then be free to speak the way that [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2131.7s)]
*  you need to speak and the way that you want to speak. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2137.14s)]
*  I don't think any Palestinian anywhere in the world ought to make themselves beholden [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2139.58s)]
*  to institutions that make us in any way complicit with genocide. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2146.9s)]
*  Better to leave the institution. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2152.5s)]
*  She's a congressperson. She's famous. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2154.78s)]
*  There are a million different ways that she can make a living. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2156.7400000000002s)]
*  But if my employer told me you have to soft sell resistance or you have to disavow [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2159.7000000000003s)]
*  resistance or you have to spread atrocity propaganda under the guise of pious concern [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2167.98s)]
*  for the victims of sexual violence, then I would walk. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2176.14s)]
*  Right. And I mean, it's easier for her to make that choice. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2182.3799999999997s)]
*  But so whatever the case, whatever the case, I don't think that there is any justification [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2186.22s)]
*  for getting onto the House floor and spreading this sort of atrocity propaganda for calling [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2192.94s)]
*  for increased sanctions and US aggression on Syria for doing all of the things that a US [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2201.54s)]
*  politician is obliged to do. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2209.5s)]
*  Over the years, people have said, I've heard people say, well, they need to do such and [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2211.42s)]
*  such to keep their job. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2216.18s)]
*  I think, OK, you're right. I mean, I'm not disputing that. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2217.86s)]
*  Of course, people, especially in the professions, especially in government, need to say or not [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2220.34s)]
*  say certain things in order to keep their jobs. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2225.22s)]
*  Well, why are their jobs so precious? [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2228.58s)]
*  What? So don't keep the job then. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2231.54s)]
*  And that never enters into anybody's mentality. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2235.3s)]
*  It's like, well, they need to do this to keep their job. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2237.78s)]
*  Well, why do they need to keep their job? [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2240.38s)]
*  No, I mean, they're not going to go hungry. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2242.26s)]
*  All right. There are a million things that there's a million things Ilhan Omar or AOC [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2244.86s)]
*  or Rashida Khalid can do. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2249.3s)]
*  You know, they're not going to go drive a school bus. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2252.1s)]
*  They're not going to become a welder. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2256.22s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? They have plenty of things that they can do to put food. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2258.06s)]
*  On the table and to continue living a professional life and an influential life, a life [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2261.7s)]
*  where you get to go around and talk to people and they pay you money and listen to you. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2267.1s)]
*  So I just yeah, I guess it's a long-winded way of saying I agree with you that that, [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2271.58s)]
*  you know, I can understand the strategic reasons and perhaps the rationale, right, [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2277.54s)]
*  for going onto the House floor and saying these things. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2284.18s)]
*  I certainly can appreciate the extraordinarily difficult position that she and other [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2287.94s)]
*  progressive politicians are in. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2293.06s)]
*  You know, they're just, you know, they're getting censored. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2295.02s)]
*  They're, you know, they're being abused. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2298.1s)]
*  They're being picked on. They're being targeted. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2300.82s)]
*  I mean, it's a horrible situation for them and nobody should go through that. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2303.18s)]
*  But I think given all of those factors, I think I think it's better just to step away [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2306.18s)]
*  as a form of protest and say this institution that I'm serving, even though I'm trying to [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2312.86s)]
*  serve it with dignity and compassion is inherently genocidal. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2317.18s)]
*  Nothing I say or do is making a difference and therefore I must leave it and focus my [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2322.8999999999996s)]
*  energies in ways where I don't feel like I'm in any way complicit with what the US [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2328.1s)]
*  government is doing. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2335.06s)]
*  Right. But this would have to also fundamentally embolden the line between the principles [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2337.8599999999997s)]
*  and the morals that they claim to have. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2346.22s)]
*  And ultimately, the climbing the greasy political ladder, which AOC seems to be doing. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2349.02s)]
*  AOC may care or may have cared in the past about specific issues, but it doesn't seem [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2362.74s)]
*  that she cares about anything more than climbing that ladder and has, you know. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2368.8199999999997s)]
*  In any case, I do agree with you completely that sometimes the most powerful thing one [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2378.66s)]
*  can do is to risk it all in order to make a very specific point. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2386.18s)]
*  Like you said, none of these people are going to starve. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2393.8199999999997s)]
*  None of these people are going to have to drive a school bus. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2396.9s)]
*  And the censorship against Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar are nothing compared to the [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2401.1800000000003s)]
*  censorship against ordinary people who lose their jobs and get deplatformed for saying [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2409.1800000000003s)]
*  very basic things about about Palestinian rights and criticizing Zionism and get smeared [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2415.78s)]
*  as anti-Semites and they lose their jobs and they lose careers and they have to switch [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2425.1s)]
*  gears. So this is the moment. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2429.3399999999997s)]
*  Everybody needs to take a stand in their own way in whatever way is appropriate for the [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2432.86s)]
*  circumstances. Period. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2438.1s)]
*  No one in history is going to look back and think, oh, AOC had to do that in order for [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2440.2599999999998s)]
*  her to remain in Congress and then eventually go to the Senate. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2446.8199999999997s)]
*  No one remembers politicians that way. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2452.82s)]
*  They remember you for the stance that you take. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2456.46s)]
*  They don't remember you for the very strategic move that you did in order to, you know. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2458.86s)]
*  So, I mean, I think this is a good way to segue into your upcoming memoir. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2465.2200000000003s)]
*  Because some people do lose their jobs and have to drive a bus. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2476.46s)]
*  And so, Stephen, in 2014, you were fired by the University of Illinois Champagne for [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2480.1400000000003s)]
*  social media posts criticizing Israel's assault on Gaza at the time, during which Israel [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2491.5s)]
*  was killing 11 children per day over 51 days. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2501.2200000000003s)]
*  And you sued the university for breach of contract, alleging that administration officials [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2505.3399999999997s)]
*  acted under pressure from pro-Israel donors. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2515.06s)]
*  And soon after, you were targeted again by the lawsuit against the American Studies [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2517.94s)]
*  Association. And after, I think it was three public academic controversies, you left [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2525.02s)]
*  academia. And your upcoming memoir, which will be published by Fordham University Press [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2535.58s)]
*  next month, titled An Honest Living, a memoir of peculiar itineraries, chronicles that [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2544.18s)]
*  journey. When you left academia, you started publishing your essays on your website, Stephen [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2553.5s)]
*  Salaita. And your very first essay on the website in February 2019 is also titled An [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2560.22s)]
*  Honest Living. And it's about that departure and your journey into becoming a school bus [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2568.02s)]
*  driver. The delivery of uninjured children, as you described it. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2579.86s)]
*  And I'd like to read a very short, it's not that short, it's a bit short, excerpt from that [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2585.54s)]
*  piece. And then I would like you to, you know, you're now back to teaching at the American [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2593.6600000000003s)]
*  University of Cairo. So you're you kind of returned to academia. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2600.42s)]
*  Okay, so you write, Becoming a school bus driver wasn't random. I used to be a professor, I [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2608.5s)]
*  rushed my way into academia, in fact, landing on the 10 year track at a public regional [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2617.1s)]
*  university, straight out of grad school. I put in a good effort to make it happen. But the [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2622.22s)]
*  career felt manifest. My father taught physics at an HBCU in southern West Virginia. And my [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2628.22s)]
*  earliest memories involved following him to work, chalk dust and textbooks, intoxicating my [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2635.74s)]
*  emergent senses. Prof called me with booming approval, his breath warm with pistachio and [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2641.62s)]
*  nicotine. I earned the moniker by disappearing into my room for hours and validated it by [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2648.58s)]
*  becoming my father's unqualified research assistant. At some point during my childhood, the [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2654.5s)]
*  nickname became a decree. I went to college at 17 knowing I would never leave. 21 years later, I [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2660.9s)]
*  got fired. Now I can't return. So you have returned and I would like you to tell me more about [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2668.14s)]
*  this upcoming memoir. And given your long and meditative departure from academia all these [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2677.9s)]
*  years, how has the return to the classroom been? I mean, I can imagine how for someone like you, [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2685.42s)]
*  who imagined your entire life remaining in the classroom, most, you know, as a student for the [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2698.94s)]
*  first parts of your life, and then as a professor, for the latter part, and being embroiled in so many [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2707.46s)]
*  public controversies about it. I'd like to hear more about that. And I, you know, despite it being an [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2714.58s)]
*  American university, you're not in the US. And you're in Cairo. And I am very curious to hear about [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2721.18s)]
*  the felt difference there from your perspective, what it's like to be a professor in Cairo. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2731.66s)]
*  Sure, I'm happy and honored to talk about it. Thank you. I mean, it's, on the one hand, difficult to [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2736.42s)]
*  have a book coming out, you know, concurrent to all of this horror. But, you know, so much of what's in [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2751.34s)]
*  the book really has to do with what's going on in Palestine and the way what's going on in Palestine [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2763.3s)]
*  reverberates out into the world and, you know, into Palestinian communities, you know, especially as [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2770.1000000000004s)]
*  they exist in the West. And so I'm going to try my best, you know, as the book becomes available in a [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2776.6600000000003s)]
*  week or two really to, you know, to keep the emphasis on Palestine as our moral and intellectual [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2786.74s)]
*  center. I think that that's, you know, that's critical. But yeah, it's just really because, you [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2794.9399999999996s)]
*  know, in 2014, when you know, that that infamous firing happened, and can I just say because I, you [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2803.8999999999996s)]
*  know, I don't go on many of these podcasts or whatever. It's a joy to do it with you all. I'm such an [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2811.98s)]
*  enormous fan of EI. It's a treat for me. Please don't call it an unhiring. People will always be [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2819.86s)]
*  calling it, he was unhired. Like what the hell is an unhired? That drives me crazy. Sorry, I had to [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2827.9s)]
*  get that pet peeve off my chest. Like that just, I get a little bit ragey when I say, Salaito was [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2832.62s)]
*  unhired and to that I was fired. It's okay to say it. I don't need any euphemisms. In fact, I'm quite [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2837.3s)]
*  proud of it. You know, it's a badge of honor, you know, to, you know, to have been fired for taking [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2842.6600000000003s)]
*  up for Palestinians. So it all really starts with, you know, putting your heart and your mind in [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2849.78s)]
*  Palestine and thinking alongside the people there and listening to them and really trying to convey [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2857.02s)]
*  points of views and sensibilities that certainly they're not always going to agree with. There's [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2863.46s)]
*  plenty of disagreement there, but that maybe at least make them feel like they're being heard [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2869.14s)]
*  and that, you know, their sensibility is not necessarily their politics, but their sensibility [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2875.3s)]
*  is being conveyed because that sensibility doesn't mesh well with the discursive norms in the West, [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2881.54s)]
*  in the United States and Canada particularly. Really, it's true in France and Germany [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2887.86s)]
*  and the UK, but, you know, and so, you know, I got fired. It ended up being a huge news story. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2893.38s)]
*  It seems like many lifetimes ago. Ended up at AUB. The Zionists interfered there. I ended up out of [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2905.62s)]
*  a job. The circumstances were different, but the result was the same. And I came back to the US and [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2913.62s)]
*  wasn't doing anything. And, you know, I won a settlement from the University of Illinois [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2919.86s)]
*  at the end of 2015. About a year and a half after the firing happened. And, you know, I mean, just [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2925.78s)]
*  the money was starting to run out. We were living in the DC suburbs after having left Beirut and, [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2933.2200000000003s)]
*  you know, with rent and food and everything else. Like, the money goes quickly. Your savings go [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2938.1s)]
*  quickly. And I realized, okay, I got to do something, you know, and so I decided to drive [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2942.02s)]
*  the school bus. It was always something that, ever since I returned to the United States, [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2947.78s)]
*  I kept seeing the signs around town were hiring for a school bus driver. And I thought, you know, [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2952.7400000000002s)]
*  this isn't bad because the last thing I wanted to do was deal with bureaucracy and professional [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2958.02s)]
*  environments. I mean, to be frank, I was very angry and bitter and depressed and, you know, [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2964.02s)]
*  not feeling very sociable. And I just couldn't have pictured myself interacting with other people [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2972.74s)]
*  in a so-called white collar environment. Doing like academic conferences and panels and this [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2978.9799999999996s)]
*  sort of thing was just out of the question. I just wasn't interested in that kind of stuff at that [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2985.22s)]
*  point. And I thought that driving the school bus would allow me to work in a meaningful way. And [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2988.8199999999997s)]
*  in a way also where I had sort of freedom not to be monitored all the time. I would be in my own [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=2995.22s)]
*  little movable world and that's what ended up happening. And the pandemic ended up disrupting [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3000.9s)]
*  everything. All of the transportation got grounded. And so the same kind of malaise and depression [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3007.06s)]
*  set in. And I was really struggling with those things. I was having a difficult time feeling, [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3012.82s)]
*  feeling useful in this world. And, you know, I didn't think that I would ever go back [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3019.46s)]
*  into the academic world. It had seemed so long, you know, before it had been years since I had [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3027.86s)]
*  had anything to do with it. And I knew, of course, that I was never going to get a job in North [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3034.9s)]
*  America. And I still won't ever get a job in North America. I've come to grips with that. That's [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3040.1800000000003s)]
*  a reality that I can't change. And I can finally say that I'm okay with that. But there's a little [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3045.2200000000003s)]
*  bit of a principle involved also. It's like, you know, the giant scientists are hell bent on making [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3051.38s)]
*  sure that I never get into a classroom again. And so just as a matter of principle, I kind of [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3056.42s)]
*  wanted to. But when something came open in Cairo and I saw the job at really quite by chance, [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3061.38s)]
*  it just felt right. I wanted to come work in the Arab world. And being in the Arab world, [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3068.1800000000003s)]
*  despite the fact that I'm at a US institution that, you know, has close ties to the State [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3074.1800000000003s)]
*  Department, that gets a lot of its funding from USAID, you know, it's a very sort of establishment [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3079.14s)]
*  institution. But it's, I honestly couldn't imagine being in the US, you know, during this [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3084.9s)]
*  genocide. I just don't really want to be around Americans. I don't want to be around Brits and [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3094.98s)]
*  Germans or Canadians either. So, you know, I don't want to be exclusive. It's important to be [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3101.6200000000003s)]
*  around my own people, to hear the language, to hear the rage. Egypt is in a bad situation. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3110.66s)]
*  Politically, we all know that. Its government is full throttle Zionist and is suppressing any kind [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3117.62s)]
*  of dissent. You know, Jordan and Egypt always sort of get matched up together, you know, as the two [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3125.14s)]
*  worst collaborators. I guess there's also the UAE. We can't forget them in Saudi either, I mean, [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3131.3799999999997s)]
*  you know, to be fair. But still, the energy on the street and on campus and in the classroom is [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3136.42s)]
*  very devoted to Palestine's liberation. And so there really is a sense of community. After October [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3145.46s)]
*  7th, last semester, we just departed from the syllabus in all of my classes and we discussed [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3151.06s)]
*  Palestine. You know, we started reading about Palestine. We started having conversations [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3157.3s)]
*  about Palestine. We were thinking together about Palestine. We were mourning together. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3162.98s)]
*  There's Palestinian imagery all over campus and all over town. And I know, I know, [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3168.18s)]
*  because imagery is imagery. It's not doing anything. And that's true. But at least you know, [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3172.82s)]
*  you're in a place where people are feeling the same way that you're feeling and that you can [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3178.42s)]
*  express yourself around them, whether they agree with you or not, in a way that's completely [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3187.22s)]
*  verboten in the United States. Like, one of the funniest things about looking at US social media [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3192.1s)]
*  is the way that something that would sound completely commonplace in the Arab world is [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3198.1s)]
*  taken as something like mortifying, you know, on Anglophone Twitter, right, in the West. It's good [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3203.4599999999996s)]
*  not to feel bound to the norms of what's considered civility in the United States. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3210.42s)]
*  And so I've been hardened, you know, by the fact that Egyptians from different social strata, [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3219.3s)]
*  but I'm mostly dealing with the middle and upper classes, of course, at AUC. But they're very [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3225.54s)]
*  devoted to Palestine's liberation. You know, they're very staunchly anti-Zionist. And they have a [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3232.5s)]
*  strong consciousness about it. And they see it in lots of ways as their issue as well. I know I'm [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3242.5s)]
*  talking a lot, but that's kind of, you know, so going back into the classroom in the Arab world [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3250.98s)]
*  has been different. Almost all of our students are from Egypt. And so I'm learning a lot about [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3256.82s)]
*  a new country. And I'm not feeling like I need to look over my shoulder constantly, or I don't feel [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3264.1s)]
*  like, you know, that I'm going to say something that is taken the wrong way and then manipulated [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3275.06s)]
*  and then sort of thrown back in my face that's going to result in some huge public controversy. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3286.66s)]
*  Of course, anything's going to happen anywhere. Egypt is no bastion of freedom. But generally [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3291.2999999999997s)]
*  speaking, it's been, the return has been really nice, but I'm still getting accustomed to it. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3297.3s)]
*  There are some things about academe that I'm simply never going to be able to reacclimate to, [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3307.54s)]
*  you know, that are just, you know, that I'm just not going to be able to make myself care about, [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3312.5800000000004s)]
*  no matter how much I try. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3317.7s)]
*  That's beautiful. I, yeah, I was an Amman for the first half of this, and [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3323.46s)]
*  it's so strange to be around [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3336.58s)]
*  a whole city of people who don't think about this. Life goes on. They live normal lives. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3341.94s)]
*  It's almost divided the world to me between people who [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3356.66s)]
*  can carry on during this and compartmentalize it in their minds and carry on or maybe do not even [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3360.9s)]
*  need to compartmentalize it. It's just a fact of life for them. And those who are just [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3371.38s)]
*  who have like a permanent soreness in their stomach, unable to carry on just thinking about [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3379.38s)]
*  this and feeling so helpless. And I'm glad that you're around, you know, the people who are [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3391.1400000000003s)]
*  unable to carry on just thinking about this and feeling so helpless. And [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3399.46s)]
*  I'm glad that you're around the latter group of people. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfuP1h86ZYo&t=3406.5800000000004s)]
