Video Description: For nearly 19 months, Israel, with financial, technological and political support from the US and Europe, has attacked every single hospital in Gaza.
The Israeli military has destroyed every aspect of Gaza‚Äôs healthcare infrastructure; executed paramedics and threw them into mass graves; and hunted, threatened, kidnapped, tortured and killed medical workers, skilled physicians and hospital directors.
And since 2 March, Israel has prevented all medications, medical supplies, food, fuel and basic essentials from entering Gaza, plunging two million people, half of them children, into a deepening catastrophe.
However, if you are a doctor in the UK and you express outrage about the genocide, you might lose your job with the National Health Service (NHS) and be accused of anti-Semitism.
‚ÄúAs doctors, our morality and our moral standing has always been held against us,‚Äù Dr. Nadeem Haddadin-Crowe tells The Electronic Intifada Podcast.
Haddadin-Crowe is a British-Jordanian doctor specializing in emergency medicine and previously worked as a contracted (‚Äúbank‚Äù) worker in an NHS hospital, but was suspended due to his social media posts about Gaza.
He is currently fundraising (https://www.crowdjustice.com/case/dr-nadeem-crowe/) for his legal case over his employment, as well as to clarify employment rights for NHS contract workers in England and advocate for the right to speak out against war crimes.

# British Jordanian doctor suspended for posts against Gaza genocide
**The Electronic Intifada:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4)
*  Hello and welcome back to the Electronic Intifada podcast. I'm Nora Barrows Friedman. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=0.0s)]
*  Over the last 18 months of genocide, Israel, with financial, technological, and political support [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=5.04s)]
*  from the US and Europe, has attacked every single hospital in Gaza, destroyed every aspect of Gaza's [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=11.76s)]
*  healthcare infrastructure, executed paramedics and threw them into mass graves, hunted, threatened, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=19.68s)]
*  kidnapped, tortured, and killed medical workers, skilled physicians, and hospital directors, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=26.56s)]
*  and since March 2nd, prevented all medications, medical supplies, food, fuel, and basic essentials [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=32.879999999999995s)]
*  from entering Gaza, plunging two million people, half of them children, into an absolute catastrophe [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=40.16s)]
*  of health, medicine, and humanity itself. However, if you are a doctor in the UK and you speak up [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=47.36s)]
*  about any of this, you might lose your job and be accused of being anti-Semitic. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=54.72s)]
*  Joining us to talk about this is Dr. Nadine Crowe. He's a British Jordanian doctor specializing [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=60.56s)]
*  in emergency medicine and previously worked as a bank worker in an NHS hospital, but was suspended [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=66.32s)]
*  and later resigned due to social media posts about Gaza. He is currently fundraising to clarify [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=73.75999999999999s)]
*  employment rights for NHS bank workers in England and advocate for the right to speak out against [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=80.48s)]
*  war crimes. Nadine, thank you so much for being with us today on the Electronic Interpol podcast. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=86.48s)]
*  Thank you, Catherine. War means a lot. Thank you so much. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  Of course. So first off, before we get into the legal fights you've been pulled into over your [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=93.12s)]
*  advocacy for Palestinians who are experiencing a genocide, talk about your work and what made [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=99.36s)]
*  you want to become a doctor? It's a difficult question to answer because I think for all of us, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=104.88s)]
*  you know, how do you know really what you want to be when you were 17 or 18? But I guess for a lot [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=112.32s)]
*  of us who end up in medicine, there's some kind of subliminal calling that brings you into a [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=117.36s)]
*  world that is very difficult to ever want to leave. And I think for me, and it'll be a similar story [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=124.39999999999999s)]
*  for a lot of medics, I was academically successful at school. But I've always loved humanity, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=130.88s)]
*  people communicating, talking, meeting people, and I have this kind of innate sense of [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=140.48s)]
*  wanting to care in my personal life and also in my professional life. So I think from the outset, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=147.6s)]
*  a career in medicine always seemed like the perfect calling. But of course, you don't know [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=154.64s)]
*  it's the perfect calling until you've been actually in the job and you've experienced it. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=159.04s)]
*  And 15 years later, I'm still doing it and I still love it. So thankfully, it was the right [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  decision and one that my Jordanian mother is obviously very proud of, like every Arab mother [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  should be. Fantastic. You know, as a healthcare professional, as someone who has dedicated his [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=173.44s)]
*  life to healing people, to treating people, to trying to mitigate pain, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=184.72s)]
*  as you look at the situation in Gaza, especially in terms of the medical catastrophe there, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=192.08s)]
*  and where your counterparts in the hospitals across Gaza are pleading with the world [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=197.6s)]
*  to make this genocide stop and bring Israel to account, what obligation do you feel you have [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=203.52s)]
*  both personally and professionally to speak up about what Palestinians are going through? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=209.68s)]
*  Personally, I think for all of us, we have an obligation to speak out. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=218.4s)]
*  And that is because the world is glitching at the moment and the moral compass seems to be [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=223.92000000000002s)]
*  not even backwards, it's just spinning around and around and around. And it's a very disconcerting [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=230.88s)]
*  place to be because, you know, when I look back at when the Ukraine and Russia war started, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=235.44s)]
*  there was this sort of united feeling that everybody had a feeling about what was going on [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=243.12s)]
*  and we could speak freely and our faces were in Ukrainian flags on Facebook and there weren't [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=248.32s)]
*  people being suspended or losing their jobs. But with Israel and Gaza, this genocide and [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=253.68s)]
*  what's been happening to the Palestinians, as somebody born in Jordan with all of their family [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=261.92s)]
*  in Jordan and obviously a huge Palestinian refugee population being there, it's always been part of [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=265.04s)]
*  my psyche. And I've always felt this huge anger and injustice as a human being. When you add on [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=270.48s)]
*  top of that the layer of being a doctor and for me an emergency doctor, you know, and working in [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=279.92s)]
*  a system which the NHS is falling apart, I don't think that's a surprise for anybody to hear. But [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=287.12s)]
*  generally the vast majority of people that I care for on a day-to-day basis as an emergency doctor [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=293.52s)]
*  in the UK are people that want care more than they need care. If you look at the Gaza situation, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=299.04s)]
*  you have a population there who need care, they need us, they need people like me. And if you're [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=307.92s)]
*  going to have a country like Israel so clearly act in this barbaric manner to cause mass casualties [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=314.16s)]
*  of women, children and men, it's heartbreaking to feel that the layer of evil above that is that when [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=324.16s)]
*  people are being barbarically traumatised physically and psychologically, there's no [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=334.56s)]
*  medical support there anymore to be able to manage it. So not only is Israel trying to cause as much [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=341.36s)]
*  physical and psychological trauma as possible, it doesn't want people like me around to be able to [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=348.72s)]
*  heal. And that's a concept that as a doctor I cannot fathom. How can that be anything other than [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=355.6s)]
*  planned and other than a new layer of evil or level of evil that I just can't comprehend? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=363.36s)]
*  Yeah, and yeah, like if you speak out about it, the government will clamp down on you and they will [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=371.59999999999997s)]
*  try to force you to be complicit with this evil, with this genocide. Let's talk a little bit about [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=383.12s)]
*  how the UK government is working to purge NHS workers. In December of 2024, Health Secretary [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=394.71999999999997s)]
*  Wes Streeting called on regulators to essentially root out healthcare professionals who criticise [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=401.35999999999996s)]
*  Israel's genocide in Gaza. How has this witch hunt unfolded within the healthcare community in the [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=408.08s)]
*  NHS and how have you been personally impacted by this? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=414.47999999999996s)]
*  I want to be very clear from the outset that I feel strongly that post October the 7th, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=419.68s)]
*  Israel thought that it now had the upper hand and the narrative for the whole world to turn around [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=428.88s)]
*  and say, well, any action we want to take against the Palestinians is now valid. If you want to [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=435.04s)]
*  ethnically cleanse it, we see why. Go ahead and do whatever you want. And when the government [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=440.4s)]
*  didn't come to fruition, when in fact what happened was that TikTok, Instagram, X, all of [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=446.88s)]
*  those platforms that gave access to the whole world to share stories and opinions on what was [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=457.84s)]
*  going on, Israel and every country supportive of it suddenly realised that they had a huge PR battle [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=462.88s)]
*  on their hands. And the way that AIPAC has its hands around the neck of many US politicians, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=471.68s)]
*  though more subliminal and more insidious in a way, there is a similar problem in the UK. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=479.12s)]
*  And then when you add to that, that as doctors, our morality and our moral standing has always [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=488.8s)]
*  been held against us as this sort of, you know, you are a doctor, you must act in this certain [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=494.08s)]
*  way. And if you don't, in fact, if you pretend to be human and you leave work and you have opinions [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=499.36s)]
*  on the world and politics and society, when you add those two things together, you've got a recipe [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=505.04s)]
*  for disaster. Then you get somebody like Wes Streeting who comes along and says, well, I'm at [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=509.44s)]
*  the head, I'm at the helm of this. And a few people have made or a few institutions like UK [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=514.08s)]
*  Lawyers for Israel, David Collier and his pseudonym Nasher Jew have made these sweeping accusations [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=521.12s)]
*  against people like me who have dared to say or have the courage to say that what's going on in [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=527.68s)]
*  Palestine against the Palestinians is not, it doesn't reflect humanity. Voices like his [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=534.0799999999999s)]
*  has basically empowered everybody now to say, well, if you're going to speak out, then you either are [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=541.3599999999999s)]
*  going to be disciplined, shamed publicly, called anti-Semitic or lose your job. And the more that [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=547.92s)]
*  happens, the less we have the, I guess, courageous few to stand forward and say, this can't happen [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=555.04s)]
*  anymore. And we can all work as conglomerates. I remember one of the first things, you know, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=564.16s)]
*  Miriam Francois saying to me when I spoke to her about what was going on, she said, make sure that [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=569.04s)]
*  you are part of a group. And I originally thought, you know, when this happened to me, and I'll, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=572.8s)]
*  you know, go into my story, let's all hide behind, you know, a conglomerate like, you know, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=578.8s)]
*  the amazing work of Health Workers of Palestine, et cetera. But actually, that doesn't work. What [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=584.56s)]
*  works most powerfully is when you put a face to your name and you stand up as an individual and [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=589.28s)]
*  you say, I'm not accepting this. And if you come at me, I'm going to fight and I'm going to name and [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=593.4399999999999s)]
*  shame. And I genuinely feel that the few of us now that have done that, we're changing the [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=598.24s)]
*  direction that the wind is blowing. But we need more and more people and we need more and more [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=605.52s)]
*  platforms. And thanks to platforms like yours, the mainstream media are not going to tell our [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=610.1600000000001s)]
*  stories. We're now getting the word out against people like Caroline Turner at UK Lawyers for [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=614.72s)]
*  Israel, like Nashejou, like all of these groups that just want to demonize doctors. And we're [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=619.6800000000001s)]
*  saying we're not accepting it. And in my case, we will take legal action. And I have no guarantee [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=626.8000000000001s)]
*  that any of us are going to win our legal action. But it's actually the winning is for me the cherry [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=632.48s)]
*  on the top. It's actually the journey to get to the trial, to be actually having these conversations [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=638.96s)]
*  and saying, we're not accepting this as a status quo. In terms of my actual story, I've been a [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=646.48s)]
*  doctor at the Royal Free Hospital or I used to be a doctor at the Royal Free Hospital in North London. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=654.96s)]
*  I've been there for 15 years. It was also my medical school. I know that place like the back [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=659.84s)]
*  of my hand that it knows me even better. And it would be a miss if I didn't mention that [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=664.24s)]
*  it has a reputation or I guess a nickname of being the Jewish hospital because we operate in [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=673.12s)]
*  Northwest London. There's a huge vibrant Jewish community there. We are one of the main hubs for [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=678.8s)]
*  Zola, the Jewish Ambulance, and probably wouldn't be the first place to work if you were an [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=684.16s)]
*  anti-Semite. I want to say that right from the outset. Probably wouldn't be the first place that [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=689.6s)]
*  you would say I want to provide my blood, sweat and tears every day if you didn't like the Jewish [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=695.1999999999999s)]
*  population or were going to be describing yourself as anti-Semitic. I arrived to do my ward rounds [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=700.24s)]
*  as I normally would. This was on the 14th of August last year and about an hour and a half, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=711.68s)]
*  two hours in, I received an email which was from Dr Jane Horden, the responsible officer. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=715.68s)]
*  She's the person that is a conduit between the NHS Trust and the General Medical Council that holds [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=721.4399999999999s)]
*  our licensing saying some concerns have been raised which I need to discuss with you. You are [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=725.5999999999999s)]
*  suspended essentially with immediate effect and won't be able to work any further shifts until [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=732.3199999999999s)]
*  a meeting which my PA will organise and you may want to organise some [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=738.32s)]
*  appropriate representation at the meeting. Now of course my whole world imploded in that moment [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=747.6s)]
*  because as a doctor your immediate concern is who have I hurt? Is this a serious clinical concern as [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=752.08s)]
*  a patient died under my care? I assumed that the other staff in the department would know [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=757.6s)]
*  that this was happening. One, because we're running a hospital and every member of staff that [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=765.84s)]
*  you lose means that an area is not covered, particularly in emergency medicine, so you would [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=770.0s)]
*  think that a responsible officer, the operative word being responsible there, would have at least [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=774.24s)]
*  let my colleagues know that they were going to be losing a member of staff that day. Of course [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=779.36s)]
*  nobody knew so I had the embarrassment for want of a better term to wander around asking various [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=783.36s)]
*  people in the department do you know what I've done, what's going on and I was sent home [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=790.08s)]
*  because nobody knew what I had done. I then went home and called the general medical council, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=795.52s)]
*  I spoke to them on a web chat and said is there something here that you have failed to tell me [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=800.96s)]
*  and they said after about half an hour of looking there's nothing relevant on the system [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=805.52s)]
*  and then I called the British Medical Association who said you cannot just be suspended with no [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=810.1600000000001s)]
*  explanation told to bring representation to a meeting, you have rights, go back and ask [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=816.1600000000001s)]
*  what's going on. So I went back to Dr. Horden and I said I don't know whether I need to bring my [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=820.72s)]
*  feisty Jordanian mother with me to this meeting or a solicitor, could you please tell me what I've [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=825.6800000000001s)]
*  done and her response was there is no grievance, I'll tell you what it is in the meeting which is [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=830.96s)]
*  an informal meeting. So again I've asked for specifics and I've been denied them, I've been [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=838.5600000000001s)]
*  suspended and then invited to an informal meeting, I mean it's all rubbish. So I end up at this [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=844.88s)]
*  meeting the following day at about 4pm and I'm faced with Dr. Horden, the responsible officer, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=854.72s)]
*  one of the heads of the human resources department and also a colleague that I've brought with me as [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=862.32s)]
*  my representation and Dr. Horden says to me my attention has been drawn to your activity on the [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=868.08s)]
*  platform X in relation to the Israel and Gaza conflict. So I sort of said and I mean in the back [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=877.76s)]
*  of my mind I'm sort of thinking I've never met this woman before, I don't know who you are rather [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=887.12s)]
*  than by email and professional reputation and kind of what's it got to do with you. So I said okay [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=891.0400000000001s)]
*  who made the complaint? Well they want to remain anonymous. Okay so what is the complaint? The posts [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=898.3199999999999s)]
*  could be potentially upsetting. Upsetting is quite a broad term isn't it because it's potentially [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=905.4399999999999s)]
*  upsetting if somebody insults your favourite football team, it's potentially upsetting if [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=911.68s)]
*  somebody said they didn't like your hair that day. So there are lots of things that are potentially [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=915.5999999999999s)]
*  upsetting. So I said well you know what is it that I've said that is potentially upsetting? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=919.52s)]
*  There will be screenshots I'm told but these screenshots are not going to be shown or shared [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=924.72s)]
*  with me. So there's something in relation to the Gaza conflict, conflict I hate that term, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=929.44s)]
*  the Gaza genocide on my ex-account which has upset somebody for some reason. I'm then told [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=935.52s)]
*  I advise you to delete the posts so I go back and say well which posts do you want me to delete? [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=945.44s)]
*  Do you want me to delete all of my posts? Are there specific posts? I do have a right to expression [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=949.36s)]
*  and freedom of speech so what do you want me to delete? And also if you're now as was described [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=954.8000000000001s)]
*  to me going to put me through a two or three week investigation then why would you want me to delete [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=960.8000000000001s)]
*  the posts which are surely there to be evidence? That's why you've brought me into this meeting, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=966.64s)]
*  that's why you've suspended me so why would I be deleting the evidence? Won't that be held against [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=970.88s)]
*  me? Well we've got screenshots I'm told, screenshots never presented. So I at this point have to say [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=975.76s)]
*  that I was sort of seeing red for want of a better term but trying to keep you know my decorum and [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=983.04s)]
*  I said look you're sitting here and looking at a British Jordanian who has very strong feelings [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=990.72s)]
*  about this and feelings that didn't emerge today and they didn't emerge on October the 7th, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=996.24s)]
*  they've been here as long as I can remember having a consciousness and it's conversations [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1000.4s)]
*  that have happened in my family and with my friends and my Palestinian friends, I was in [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1005.6s)]
*  Jordan on October the 7th and I said if I want to share the pictures of a baby who's being beheaded [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1009.52s)]
*  by a bomb and say that this is disgusting I'll do it and by the way Dr. Wharton is a neonatologist, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1017.52s)]
*  her career is looking after babies and I'm sitting here thinking why is this hospital [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1023.52s)]
*  surprised that I'm angry about this? Why am I having to explain myself to this person I've [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1029.2s)]
*  never met before in this informal meeting on posts that I don't know you know I posted on X this [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1035.44s)]
*  morning I couldn't go back and tell you what I've posted. If somebody wanted to have a rational [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1042.64s)]
*  conversation and pick up a post and say this could be misconstrued in a particular way what did you [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1047.04s)]
*  mean? I'm an adult, I can have a conversation, I can discuss my feelings and my emotions and I can [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1051.3600000000001s)]
*  reflect on how somebody might be offended. What I won't do is have somebody essentially say that [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1056.96s)]
*  you cannot have a voice on this at all and I want you to go away and delete it or any voice or [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1062.4s)]
*  speech that you've made and so my next question was and this won't surprise anybody are you [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1069.44s)]
*  accusing me of anti-Semitism and I was told that's not what I said and I said well what are you [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1074.48s)]
*  accusing me of because you're about to put me through an investigation what are you investigating [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1080.96s)]
*  and who do you have on your panel that can sit in front of me and look me in the eye and act as [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1086.56s)]
*  some kind of morality police in this situation and I was literally met with stammers to the [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1091.44s)]
*  extent that I said you need to stop stammering and you need to answer my question. I was then told [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1096.72s)]
*  you could bring a specialist on the conflict to your investigation to advise on what is acceptable [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1105.04s)]
*  so I said whoa whoa whoa wait a minute are you asking me to provide a history lesson and if you [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1111.44s)]
*  need a history lesson you should have had it before you suspended me and you should have provided it [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1118.96s)]
*  to yourself not asked me to bring it after you put me through the the stress of the last 24 hours [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1124.0s)]
*  that having to leave work as a professional who's worked in this trust without a single [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1131.1200000000001s)]
*  complaint for 15 years and now you want me to bring a specialist in because you don't think [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1135.6000000000001s)]
*  that I have what the the ability or the experience to advise what I think is acceptable and have a [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1140.64s)]
*  discussion about it. The meeting ended shortly after that I did exactly what I was asked to do [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1146.48s)]
*  I went off to Dr Ghada and Carmine and I said Ghada can you please come to these meetings [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1153.3600000000001s)]
*  she said hell yeah of course I can. I went to Miriam Francois and I said can you come to this [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1159.3600000000001s)]
*  meeting and she said I'll absolutely come to the meeting. The colleague that had been there [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1165.1200000000001s)]
*  represented me in the meeting said look I think they will go lighter on you if you delete your [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1170.56s)]
*  posts and I said you have to you have to remember in this moment I've had to ring my parents and say [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1175.12s)]
*  I could lose my job as a doctor I'm trying to think where's my income coming from here next I [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1182.6399999999999s)]
*  mean I've got to I can't work anywhere if I'm being investigated and I'm also trying to balance [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1188.8s)]
*  my moral compass so I'm in this kind of fight-or-flight mode I need to keep my job [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1195.68s)]
*  but I need to keep my morality my dad was amazing because he said to me you know if this is the sword [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1200.5600000000002s)]
*  that you die on do you know what good good good luck you know let this be the fight that kills [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1204.4s)]
*  your medical career if it needs to be and that kind of left me with this feeling of you know what [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1211.2s)]
*  just go forward with this be who you are if you cannot work as a doctor who has delivered nothing [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1215.52s)]
*  but and I say this with the absolute pride excellent care for 15 years it's their loss [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1220.48s)]
*  I'll find another career and I know I will so I deleted my posts and I sent an email to Dr. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1227.3600000000001s)]
*  Wharton and also the HR rep and I said I'm ready for your investigation just to let you know I've [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1234.24s)]
*  deleted my whole account because I don't know which posts you're upset about so I've got no if [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1240.56s)]
*  you're not going to say it's this one this one and this one the whole thing can go but X allows you [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1244.4s)]
*  to reactivate it for the next 30 days if you want to bring it up for this form of investigation [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1248.8s)]
*  and then wake up to an email that says thank you for your action and reflection on posts that could [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1253.52s)]
*  upset people and you can now return to work and no further action will be needed so part of me goes [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1259.28s)]
*  well well that's a win isn't it and I can go back to work and call my mum and say it's all over [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1267.12s)]
*  but part of me's thinking hang on a minute yesterday you were telling me that I'm going [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1272.8000000000002s)]
*  through an investigation because of whatever this accusation was you're saying that my posts were so [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1278.5600000000002s)]
*  severe that you removed me from work as a doctor with no explanation and no evidence [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1285.2s)]
*  but now that I don't have a voice you're happy for me to return to work so I then got I'm then told [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1293.1200000000001s)]
*  that I have to attend my department to speak to a consultant that I've known for 15 years to have [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1300.32s)]
*  this debrief about how I am going to control my expressions over the conflict in a way that won't [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1306.1599999999999s)]
*  upset people and I sit there in this frankly patronising meeting where I'm told well you know [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1312.72s)]
*  so I say well okay maybe I'll go and work with health workers for Palestine because that could [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1319.28s)]
*  be a way to speak to other people with similar feelings on it and they go well don't they protest [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1323.4399999999998s)]
*  well yeah they protest well I'm not sure about that so I'm thinking well I keep having to say [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1328.16s)]
*  less and less severe things so that I'm a comfortable person for them to have around [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1332.4s)]
*  and that meeting ends I then have to send an email then goes out to say that I've accepted that I [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1337.92s)]
*  will do will and won't do x y and z and I can go back to work so I've now lost all of my shifts [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1344.0s)]
*  for the following four to six weeks I get a four shifts or something I work them and every shift [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1349.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm there I'm feeling more and more resentment for this place that I've given my life to [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1356.5600000000002s)]
*  thinking who accused me are they in my immediate you know environment is it one of the nurses [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1361.92s)]
*  I had received by the way a private Facebook message from a nurse about two months prior [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1369.6000000000001s)]
*  saying she was too afraid to walk down the corridor in case she would bump into me or one [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1375.28s)]
*  of my fellow fellow Palestinians and we would attack her so I was thinking is it her could [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1380.16s)]
*  well be her the language you know when I eventually got to see the email four months later seems [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1385.04s)]
*  pretty similar and I decided that I couldn't work there anymore and that I guess is I've spoken a [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=1389.36s)]

*  was correct in fact i was crying my eyes out and i got this sort of pseudo empathy and a kind of [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=2456.24s)]
*  response that i can't comment as to whether what happened to you is according to policies because [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=2462.7999999999997s)]
*  i'd have to look them up again i found mind-blowing because you'd expect a chief [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=2467.44s)]
*  medical officer would know the local policies but that's sort of uh an aside i um informed her that [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=2470.88s)]
*  i was going to raise a formal grievance and she assured me that the grievance would be dealt with [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=2479.52s)]

*  term it means that i at one point i stepped out of full-time contracted medicine and i uh book [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=2495.12s)]
*  shifts usually a month or six weeks in advance and i'm paid essentially by the hour but i've [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=2503.44s)]
*  always worked at the royal free solely i've worked there for 25 30 hours a week in fact [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=2508.08s)]

*  employee because i also work as an actor in the west end and by the oils behind me i'm a perfumer [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=2517.3599999999997s)]

*  discrimination uh i perceive this as a discrimination of me as a british geordanian me and my protected [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=2537.84s)]
*  beliefs particularly in the shadow of the david miller case which people can read up if they [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=2545.12s)]
*  don't know about it a really important case which is being appealed at the moment [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=2548.64s)]
*  and i i believe that this treatment of of me in terms of this you know anonymous complaints don't [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=2552.56s)]
*  share the evidence informal meeting but i've already been suspended it doesn't match any kind [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=2559.3599999999997s)]
*  of employment law or policy that can exist and um my uh employee uh sort of terms of employment [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=2564.16s)]

*  trust grievance policy now um in terms of all other policies so i contacted the trust to say [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=2579.2799999999997s)]
*  by the way which policy did you use against me and they sent me two policies and both of them said [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=2586.56s)]
*  these exclude bank workers so i said well you even your grievance policy says it includes [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=2591.2799999999997s)]
*  excludes bank workers but my contract says see the grievance policy so you're sending me in a circle [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=2597.04s)]
*  where are the bank worker policies never heard that no response again making it up as they go [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=2601.76s)]

*  war against the garzons by a population that was so strongly linked to that within their history [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=2630.72s)]
*  and the horrific actions of the nazis and of course he got a barrage of anti-semite anti-semite [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=2636.56s)]
*  anti-semite he then got dealt with a legal document by the royal free saying essentially [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=2643.04s)]
*  delete your posts say you'll never say anything about it again on social media or you know that [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=2651.6s)]

*  given a formal uh you know accusation of anti-semitism and a legal document so on the [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=2680.72s)]
*  surface it appears that he had a more severe accusation against him yet he had a kind of get [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=2686.48s)]
*  out of jail free card sign this won't say any more about it get on with it and he was concerned [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=2692.7999999999997s)]
*  about that he was also generally disgusted again that a hospital had acted in that way [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=2697.52s)]
*  um but also to an extent in the the fact that um he had been victim of it because he did delete [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=2703.9199999999996s)]

*  fall they'd get an action and then they could kind of make the whole thing go away and go back to [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=2735.84s)]
*  whoever had made the complaint and say well look we spoke to him and now he's never going to say [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=2741.12s)]

*  ignored i then put my filing into the employment tribunal um and in the uk employment tribunal [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=2786.08s)]

*  who can mediate between an employee and employer in the hope that it doesn't have to go to court [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=2801.36s)]
*  and somebody can take some responsibility for actions and that period lasts 30 days before [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=2807.04s)]

*  do we have to take the burden off the others to do that because not everybody is as lucky as we are [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=3839.12s)]
*  to be able to do it you have to also stand your ground immediately i've never been subject to a [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=3843.84s)]
*  disciplinary so i didn't know what it entailed i didn't know what i didn't know that it wasn't [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=3854.48s)]
*  normal if you think that something in your sixth sense tells you what's happening is not right it's [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=3858.8s)]
*  probably not right and i knew from the minute it happened it wasn't right but i didn't have the [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=3864.48s)]
*  jigsaw pieces to put together you at any point in the disciplinary process can stop and say [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=3869.28s)]
*  i need evidence i need time i need to know exactly what the accusation is and i need to be able to [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=3876.16s)]
*  respond and i need particularly in the case of a suspension complete justification as to how this [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=3883.52s)]
*  decision has been made and who's been involved and also if you want other examples of when suspension [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=3890.88s)]
*  has been brought in and why such a severe measure has been taken and and with many if not all [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=3896.32s)]
*  disciplinary processes if they are done in a poor way like mine was you can raise a grievance [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=3902.0s)]
*  immediately and on the whole that will stop a disciplinary process until the grievance is answered [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=3908.32s)]
*  and you will suddenly be faced by an hr department that has to answer questions that they're probably [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=3913.7599999999998s)]
*  not prepared to answer the next thing is sharing the burden but having the confidence to be a face [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=3918.88s)]
*  and a name and by sharing the burden i mean reach out to people like me you know reach out to people [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=3928.96s)]
*  like dr ali and you know reach out to to you know anybody you you you know or resonates with you in [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=3934.56s)]
*  the way they communicate their story and stand up for your your moral compass i know i'm an excellent [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=3942.48s)]
*  doctor that will never bring anybody to harm whatever you believe and there are other other [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=3951.92s)]
*  protected beliefs which don't get this kind of treatment you know and you need to look around [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=3958.64s)]
*  at what those protected beliefs are you need to think what other beliefs you have particularly [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=3964.64s)]
*  those that sit under the equality act and how you would react if those things were being held against [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=3970.88s)]
*  you and when you do that it puts a lot of things in perspective in terms of what i hope for [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=3976.4s)]
*  the future of doctors and juniors because i can imagine a lot of particularly doctors of middle [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=3983.6800000000003s)]
*  eastern background palestinian background a lot of arab and palestinian doctors really want to come [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=3989.28s)]
*  and work in the uk for a period and i can see this now being a place where they go i wouldn't even [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=3994.1600000000003s)]
*  dream of it i really really hope that the wind turns in such a direction that people like west [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=3999.52s)]
*  street and people like kirstama who have defended these atrocities see their day in the international [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=4010.88s)]
*  courts and that we are watching a documentary on netflix about them having to explain themselves [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=4017.36s)]
*  the same way that you know these war criminals in the past have had to and we see these as [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=4024.48s)]
*  we see the next generation who have brought us a lot of hope via platforms like tiktok which by the [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=4031.04s)]
*  way i hate in every other form because i'm basically a 40 year old that doesn't understand it [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=4036.2400000000002s)]
*  i've tried it i don't get it we see the tiktok generation who have empowered everybody with [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=4040.64s)]
*  their voices we see their moral compass as the lesson for the future we have to shape the world [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=4048.08s)]
*  that we want to live in for ourselves i hope to be alive for another 40 50 years and i hope to be [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=4055.6s)]
*  part of the journey to an end point that i want to be part of and look back and be proud of and be [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=4060.96s)]
*  part of the curation of a society and a planet that we all want to be proud of and at the moment [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=4065.6s)]
*  being controlled by people who shouldn't be in control creating a world that [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=4071.7599999999998s)]
*  i'm not proud of and i refuse to be silent on and if that feeling in your heart and gutters that [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=4079.2s)]
*  you refuse to be silent to then speak out because the silence will destroy you [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=4086.24s)]
*  indeed thank you for that i think i think it is it is so important to keep holding on to that vision [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=4092.56s)]
*  of a just world in you know and and you know it it's so important because every day we are just [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=4101.76s)]
*  it's so important because every day we are just we're in this cycle of watching the worst things [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=4113.92s)]
*  we've ever seen in our lives you know those of us who are not in gaza for the people in gaza [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=4122.56s)]
*  it is an indescribable horror and and to see the world capitulating to every demand [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=4130.56s)]
*  that that the perpetrators of this horror have is you know it is it is not it is not the world we [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=4138.96s)]
*  we deserve and it's not the world that anybody should should be subjected to and so i think [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=4152.16s)]
*  keeping that in mind and and speaking out and not just to protect yourself and your colleagues [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=4159.36s)]
*  um but to protect the vision of this future that that we all that we all need and and and we all [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=4165.68s)]
*  deserve is really important and i think that you know what you're saying is the truth when somebody [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=4174.0s)]
*  tries to stop it um it's very clear that that's almost the the absolute signal that you're on the [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=4179.84s)]
*  right moral track because if you can't get people on board with your pr to be agreeing by now [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=4188.400000000001s)]
*  the only thing you can do is silence what you don't want the world to hear or think [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=4196.4800000000005s)]
*  and those that are always going to be the first victims are those with a [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=4202.8s)]
*  i guess quantitative platform the likes of kneecap and people that have got hundreds of [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=4208.8s)]
*  thousands of followers or those with a qualitative platform which of those seem to have a good [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=4214.320000000001s)]
*  judgment of the world or moral standing and that's when your health care workers come in [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugxnuhmAF4&t=4221.5199999999995s)]
