# Why Iran supports Palestine, with Ali Abunimah and Mohammad Marandi
**The Electronic Intifada:** [April 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg)
*  Hello, my name is Ali Abu-Nima and this is the Electronic Intifada podcast. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm really pleased to be joined today by Dr. Muhammad Marandi. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Dr. Marandi is a professor of English Literature and Orientalism at the University of Tehran. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=9.76s)]
*  Welcome Dr. Marandi. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=16.56s)]
*  Thank you very much for having me, Ali. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=19.18s)]
*  I've had the pleasure of seeing you many times on such outlets as the BBC and CNN skillfully [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=22.0s)]
*  pushing back against Western propaganda and you never fail to impress with your command [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=27.96s)]
*  of the facts and analytical insights. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=33.32s)]
*  So I'm really looking forward to our conversation today. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=36.28s)]
*  You're very kind. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=40.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=41.08s)]
*  So on Monday, a presumed Israeli airstrike hit the Iranian consulate in Damascus, killing [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=42.08s)]
*  at least a dozen people, including two senior Iranian officers, General Muhammad Reza Zahidi [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=49.72s)]
*  and his deputy General Muhammad Hadi Haj Rahimi. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=56.32s)]
*  This brazen attack on the diplomatic mission has been condemned even by such staunch Israeli [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=62.16s)]
*  allies and adversaries of Iran as the European Union. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=67.92s)]
*  Why do you think Israel carried out this attack and what role did the two generals play in [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=73.58s)]
*  the regional resistance to Israel? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=78.8s)]
*  I really don't understand why the regime took such a step. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=83.76s)]
*  I think it was a major miscalculation because until now the Iranians have not responded [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=90.08s)]
*  directly for a number of reasons. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=100.52s)]
*  I think that over the years the Iranians did not respond because Iran had a long term plan [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=103.84s)]
*  for the whole region. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=111.44s)]
*  They were helping the resistance in Gaza develop their tunnels and their defense capabilities [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=114.83999999999999s)]
*  in Lebanon, in Yemen, in Iraq, in Syria, something which we knew was happening, but I didn't [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=122.52s)]
*  know that it would be so extensive and so well planned. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=132.4s)]
*  I think over the years the Iranians were holding back because they had a much bigger [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=138.64s)]
*  project, and that was, as I said, strengthening the resistance axis. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=143.64s)]
*  Over the past few months the Iranians, again, when the Israeli regime would carry out airstrikes [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=150.44s)]
*  and on a number of occasions they martyred a number of Iranian officers in Syria, the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=157.72s)]
*  Iranians, again, did not respond or they didn't respond directly because they wanted the focus [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=167.6s)]
*  to remain on Gaza. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=174.12s)]
*  They didn't want the Israeli regime to be able to change the narrative and to draw attention [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=178.16s)]
*  away from the genocide or what many, including the Brazilian president, would compare to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=185.28s)]
*  the Holocaust during the Second World War. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=195.08s)]
*  That I think was the main reason why the Iranians held back both over the past few years but [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=201.44000000000003s)]
*  also during the past few months. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=207.52s)]
*  But in this particular case it's different. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=210.4s)]
*  The very fact that this airstrike was against an attack on Iranian sovereignty made it [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=216.04s)]
*  necessary for the Iranians to respond. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=225.92s)]
*  And of course the officers who were murdered, they were working to support the resistance. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=229.56s)]
*  I think by now everyone knows that Damascus has always played and continues to play a [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=236.56s)]
*  key role in supporting the resistance, both Hezbollah but also the Palestinian resistance [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=242.68s)]
*  movements. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=252.68s)]
*  And Iran, these officers, played a key role in coordinating and helping Hamas, Islamic [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=254.8s)]
*  Jihad, Hezbollah to be able to defend themselves against this brutal, genocidal and barbaric [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=265.28s)]
*  regime. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=273.52s)]
*  So these men played a very important role. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=275.67999999999995s)]
*  But I don't believe that by murdering them Israelis have scored any real success because [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  There are others who will replace them. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=291.28000000000003s)]
*  The support for Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Ansarullah, the Yemeni armed forces, Hezbollah and the [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=294.72s)]
*  resistance, that will continue. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=301.72s)]
*  But what has happened is that the Israeli regime has provided Iran with a very good [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=306.44s)]
*  excuse to strike back. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=312.32000000000005s)]
*  As I said, while Iran did not want to directly strike the regime because of its, as I said [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=315.2s)]
*  earlier, because of its long-term project and more recently because they wanted to keep [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=322.48s)]
*  the focus on Gaza, but they've gone too far. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=327.16s)]
*  And this I think will see the regime pay a price. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=333.64s)]
*  As we're speaking, Iran has said it will respond. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=340.28000000000003s)]
*  That response has not come yet, at least not that we can see. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=343.84000000000003s)]
*  And perhaps by the time people are watching this interview, we'll know what it may be. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=349.8s)]
*  I want to come back to some of the points you made about the resistance and Iran's role [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=358.32000000000005s)]
*  in supporting it. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=363.68s)]
*  Before we get to that, yesterday as we're speaking, marked Quds Day, and that's an annual [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=366.08s)]
*  day of solidarity with Palestine, established by Ayatollah Khomeini after the Iranian revolution, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=375.59999999999997s)]
*  the Islamic revolution. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=383.68s)]
*  And marking Quds Day this year, some of the most prominent leaders of the resistance axis, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=385.59999999999997s)]
*  gave speeches at what I believe was an unprecedented online conference hosted by Yemen's [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=392.52000000000004s)]
*  Ansarullah movement. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=399.6s)]
*  And the speakers, of course, included Ansarullah leader, Abdul Malik al-Houthi, Iranian president, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=401.24s)]
*  Ibrahim Raisi, Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and Hamas chief, Ismail Haniyeh. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=407.64000000000004s)]
*  Did you watch the conference? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=414.96000000000004s)]
*  And what do you think the overall message of this? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=418.44s)]
*  What should we take away from it? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=421.8s)]
*  I had an invitation to go to the conference hall where people were sitting and watching. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=425.47999999999996s)]
*  But unfortunately, I had a different commitment. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=432.8s)]
*  It's Ramadan and in Iran, there are many things going on simultaneously. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=437.12s)]
*  So I couldn't participate, but I read the summary of what the Iranian president said [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=442.21999999999997s)]
*  and what the other three gentlemen said. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=449.64s)]
*  I think it was sending a message that this is a united front. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=454.08s)]
*  This is a single, let's say, not an organization, but a single gathering of allies where they [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=460.59999999999997s)]
*  all have similar agendas and they all have the determination to support one another. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=477.32s)]
*  And in this case, of course, the top priority is to support the people of Palestine. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=490.08s)]
*  Ansarullah in Yemen, from the very beginning, they stated very clearly that the reason why [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=497.64s)]
*  they're blocking ships traveling to and from Israeli ports is because of the genocide. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=504.56s)]
*  They were implementing the genocide convention. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=510.71999999999997s)]
*  And when the Americans and the British started attacking Yemen in response, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=516.16s)]
*  they started blocking American and British ships too. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=521.1999999999999s)]
*  So this has everything to do about genocide and nothing to do about self-interest because [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=523.92s)]
*  Ansarullah in Yemen are paying a price. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=532.88s)]
*  They experienced a decade of genocide with Western support and they know quite well what [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=534.64s)]
*  price they have to pay to support Gaza, but they were determined to do so. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=545.28s)]
*  The same is true with Hezbollah. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=549.52s)]
*  Hezbollah has given many martyrs over the past few months, over 250, maybe closer to 270 martyrs. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=550.88s)]
*  And of course, a large number of civilians, maybe 100 more, were also killed during this period. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=560.48s)]
*  Lebanese civilians. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=569.6s)]
*  And for a small country like Lebanon, that is a very significant number. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=571.6800000000001s)]
*  So Hezbollah is also sacrificing for the sake of Hamas and its allies, Islamic Jihad and others. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=577.2s)]
*  And of course, the resistance in Iraq and Syria are doing the same. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=586.64s)]
*  So I think this gathering of resistance leaders is just making this point more clear to the West [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=590.4s)]
*  that we are all in this together. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=600.3199999999999s)]
*  We are all one. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=603.12s)]
*  We are a united force. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=604.4s)]
*  The resistance is not just Iran. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=606.7199999999999s)]
*  It's not just Gaza. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=608.8s)]
*  It's not just the West Bank or Lebanon. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=610.4s)]
*  It's all of these entities combined. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=613.28s)]
*  And I think that the Americans and the Europeans have been quite shocked. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=616.24s)]
*  Right now, we've seen that the Americans are beginning to understand that they cannot win [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=624.5600000000001s)]
*  in the Red Sea. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=630.0s)]
*  The Israeli regime has seen that it has been defeated by the resistance in Gaza. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=630.72s)]
*  In the North, they are facing crisis. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=637.28s)]
*  Wherever we look, the Israeli regime is in trouble. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=639.76s)]
*  And the Americans are in trouble too. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=647.28s)]
*  Because the Americans know that if they get involved directly, they will be hammered in [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=648.88s)]
*  Iraq and Syria. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=654.8s)]
*  The resistance in Iraq has already shown the Americans a bit of what they can do. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=656.64s)]
*  But if the Americans get involved directly, then I think the United States would lose [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=661.68s)]
*  everything in Iraq and Syria. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=668.24s)]
*  And that would, of course, be devastating. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=670.72s)]
*  So the regime is facing, has already been defeated. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=673.2s)]
*  And I think that its defeat will only get worse as we move forward. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=679.6s)]
*  And if they expand the war, it will only make things worse. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=690.64s)]
*  The regime wants to find a path to victory. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=694.08s)]
*  Or at least a path that can save it from defeat. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=697.36s)]
*  But any path that I can see will only make the defeat worse and more costly. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=701.76s)]
*  In fact, I believe that if we put aside the genocide, if we exclude that fact, we all [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=708.72s)]
*  want an immediate ceasefire because we want to stop the genocide, because we want to stop [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=716.24s)]
*  the Western-backed slaughter of women and children. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=722.64s)]
*  However, if we put that aside for a moment, the side that really needs a ceasefire is [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=727.52s)]
*  the Israeli regime. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=733.52s)]
*  The longer this war lasts, the more humiliating it is because they haven't been able to take [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=735.44s)]
*  a small piece of land. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=742.0s)]
*  We have to always keep in mind Gaza is a very small piece of land. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=743.52s)]
*  This is the same Israeli regime that in the past took the Sinai, it took the West Bank, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=748.88s)]
*  it took the Golan Heights, when it invaded Lebanon, it went to Beirut within days. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=755.5200000000001s)]
*  It can't, today it cannot even take Gaza. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=761.6800000000001s)]
*  So this is a humiliating defeat for the regime. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=765.9200000000001s)]
*  But in addition to that, because of the genocide, and I think the genocide itself is worse than [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=770.8000000000001s)]
*  anything else for the regime, it has turned the world against it, even in the West, as [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=777.5200000000001s)]
*  you know, much better than I. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=782.72s)]
*  Things are changing. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=785.6800000000001s)]
*  I never thought I'd see the day when public opinion in the United States and North America [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=786.96s)]
*  and Europe would evolve in the way it is evolving now. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=792.48s)]
*  The longer this war lasts, the worse it becomes for the regime, the more illegitimate it [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=796.6400000000001s)]
*  becomes in the eyes of global public opinion. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=802.5600000000001s)]
*  It was always illegitimate in the eyes of those of us who were following the issue of [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=804.96s)]
*  Palestine more closely. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=810.48s)]
*  But now the world is seeing the regime for what it really is. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=812.88s)]
*  And in addition to that, the antagonism towards this genocidal regime becomes more entrenched [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=818.08s)]
*  because the longer it lasts, the more cemented this view of the regime becomes. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=826.72s)]
*  So they need a ceasefire more than anyone else. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=836.16s)]
*  But because of their arrogance and because of their ethno-supremacism and because of [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=841.12s)]
*  Eurocentrism and American exceptionalism, these entities, the West, Israel, they simply [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=848.5600000000001s)]
*  cannot accept reality. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=856.72s)]
*  They cannot accept the fact that they have been soundly defeated by these natives and [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=858.96s)]
*  that no matter what they do, they cannot reverse this defeat. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=865.44s)]
*  And you and I share your analysis in terms of if we don't count mass murder as a success, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=870.1600000000001s)]
*  then Israel, which of course we can't and mustn't, that Israel has nothing to show [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=882.5600000000001s)]
*  for six months of its savagery in Gaza. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=888.24s)]
*  And you make the case that they need a ceasefire that they cannot bring themselves to accept. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=893.9200000000001s)]
*  But there's another view that the, and maybe not a contradictory view, that the brazen [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=899.36s)]
*  attack on the Iranian diplomatic mission in Damascus and the murder of two senior generals [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=907.36s)]
*  is an attempt by Israel to spark a wider regional conflagration and possibly to pull [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=913.6800000000001s)]
*  the United States into a direct confrontation with Iran. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=920.08s)]
*  Do you agree with that? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=926.5600000000001s)]
*  You know, Ali, you know about how the Western elites and Western regimes have always viewed [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=930.08s)]
*  West Asia, North Africa, the whole of the global South, even Russians, as being irrational, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=944.32s)]
*  as being illogical, as being emotional. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=951.0400000000001s)]
*  But I think in truth, we are seeing an enormous amount of irrational behavior among these [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=955.2800000000001s)]
*  Western elites. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=966.08s)]
*  What they are doing, what the Israeli regime is doing today is detrimental to its own [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=968.0s)]
*  interests. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=975.6s)]
*  It is destroying itself. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=976.8000000000001s)]
*  The regime is, in my opinion, this regime is not going to last. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=978.6400000000001s)]
*  I don't know if it'll end in two years or in 10 years, but this regime is on the decline. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=982.88s)]
*  It won't last because of the genocide, more than even the defeat. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=989.6s)]
*  I think the genocide itself is the greatest defeat for the regime because that's what's [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=995.76s)]
*  made it so hated across the world. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1000.88s)]
*  So that may be the objective, that they want to draw Iran into the war and thus expand it. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1004.88s)]
*  But this is not going to help the regime. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1012.4s)]
*  This is not going to help them win the war. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1015.68s)]
*  So, and when you put this alongside their irrational behavior just over the past few [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1022.24s)]
*  days, what they did in the Al-Shifa hospital, beyond the fact that it was barbaric and it [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1026.8s)]
*  was as evil as anyone can imagine, they only further destroyed themselves in the eyes of [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1038.24s)]
*  the world. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1049.76s)]
*  Simultaneously, they went and struck an Iranian embassy, and also further diminishing their [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1050.72s)]
*  credibility across the world. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1061.76s)]
*  Forget the West. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1063.12s)]
*  In China and Russia and elsewhere, the world is condemning this. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1065.6799999999998s)]
*  In the West, it's more nuanced. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1070.8s)]
*  In the Security Council, the Western powers refused to condemn it. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1074.9599999999998s)]
*  But across the world, it was condemned. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1079.36s)]
*  I'm sorry for interrupting. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1082.0s)]
*  And then in addition to that, on the same day, the withdrawal from the hospital, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1083.6799999999998s)]
*  the murder of the Iranians in the embassy and the consulate, but also the murder of [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1090.0800000000002s)]
*  the aid workers who were a part of an organization that is extraordinarily close to the United States. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1098.0800000000002s)]
*  These are demolishing the regime. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1107.2s)]
*  So you may be correct. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1110.64s)]
*  The objective of the regime may be to expand the war. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1113.3600000000001s)]
*  But it is their assessment or their calculations, I think, are not based on rational thought. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1118.08s)]
*  They are being irrational, emotional, and that is only going to hurt them. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1126.2399999999998s)]
*  Because let us assume the war has expanded. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1132.8799999999999s)]
*  First of all, the Iranians are going to respond. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1136.4799999999998s)]
*  So the Israelis are going to face humiliation because they're going to be hit by [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1138.9599999999998s)]
*  a power and there's nothing that they can do about it. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1145.68s)]
*  The most important power in West Asia, arguably. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1148.3999999999999s)]
*  Then what happens? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1153.52s)]
*  The Israelis strike back at Iran again, then the Iranians will strike back. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1155.28s)]
*  If, let's say, the Israelis cannot win a war against Iran, they would be on the losing end of [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1160.24s)]
*  these exchanges. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1167.28s)]
*  So their only hope would be for the Americans to come in. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1168.72s)]
*  But if the Americans come in, what happens? [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1171.6s)]
*  Who is more vulnerable? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1173.6s)]
*  Who has the most to lose? [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1174.6399999999999s)]
*  American bases exist across the Persian Gulf. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1177.68s)]
*  Those countries that host American bases, those family dictatorships that host these bases, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1181.84s)]
*  if the Americans attack Iran, they will all be seen as complicit. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1189.84s)]
*  They cannot host bases and allow and the Americans attack Iran and then they stand aside and say it's [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1193.9199999999998s)]
*  none of our business. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1203.1999999999998s)]
*  They will pay the price. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1204.8s)]
*  The Americans will pay the price in Iran. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1207.4399999999998s)]
*  The Americans will pay the price in Syria. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1209.84s)]
*  What will happen to the global economy if we see key infrastructure in the Persian Gulf destroyed? [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1212.72s)]
*  What will happen to the global economy? [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1220.16s)]
*  This is not something that the United States can afford. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1222.8s)]
*  No one will win. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1228.0s)]
*  But there is a balance of terror. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1231.2s)]
*  You recall, since you and I, I think, are a bit older, during the Cold War, there was a balance [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1235.92s)]
*  of terror between the United States and the Soviet Union. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1241.6000000000001s)]
*  Because both had nuclear weapons and they could destroy one another. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1244.48s)]
*  So because of that terror that would arise, that existed because of nuclear weapons, the two sides [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1248.0800000000002s)]
*  refrained from using them. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1256.8000000000002s)]
*  In the Persian Gulf, there is a balance of terror. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1259.68s)]
*  The Americans can hit Iran without a doubt, but the Americans are very vulnerable and there's [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1262.0s)]
*  nothing to do about it. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1267.8400000000001s)]
*  There is a balance of terror because the global economy will come crashing down if there's a [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1269.3600000000001s)]
*  conflict between Iran and the United States. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1276.24s)]
*  And the biggest loser would be the United States because by far they have the most to lose. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1278.24s)]
*  So I don't think that if the war expands, the Israelis will come to the United States. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1284.24s)]
*  That if the war expands, the Israelis will come out on top. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1293.9199999999998s)]
*  And I think I have no doubt that they won't. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1300.08s)]
*  And I think it will only detach Western public opinion further from the regime. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1302.7199999999998s)]
*  Even as it is already moving away, as we're seeing in the poll, in the polling in the United States, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1310.1599999999999s)]
*  in Europe, we're seeing how Israel is losing its standing in the West. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1316.4s)]
*  If the West makes a larger sacrifice, if its economies start crashing down, I think that [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1324.5600000000002s)]
*  that would be the end of Israel. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1333.68s)]
*  Let's talk a bit more about the situation in the Persian Gulf and the broader region. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1338.0800000000002s)]
*  But since you mentioned the family dictatorships in the region, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1343.76s)]
*  for decades now, the United States has been trying to corral its regional clients into what [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1351.52s)]
*  I would call an unholy alliance with Israel on the pretext that this is necessary to confront [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1358.3999999999999s)]
*  a supposed threat from Iran. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1364.3999999999999s)]
*  And that was really the basis for the so-called Abraham Accords under the Trump administration [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1366.72s)]
*  in which the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, for example, established formal ties with the [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1372.24s)]
*  apartheid regime in Tel Aviv. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1378.64s)]
*  The big prize, of course, was always supposed to be a Saudi-Israeli normalization deal. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1382.32s)]
*  And although they have strong public flirtations, let's say, and secret ties that go back many [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1390.24s)]
*  decades, the formal normalization has not happened yet, even though many expected it to happen. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1398.1599999999999s)]
*  Instead, what happened just over a year ago is that Saudi Arabia and Iran surprised the world [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1407.04s)]
*  by reestablishing diplomatic relations and agreeing to resolve their disagreements through [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1414.6399999999999s)]
*  dialogue and diplomacy. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1421.28s)]
*  Significantly, as a sign of the shifting world order, this deal was brokered by China. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1424.08s)]
*  Talk to us about the background to this important development. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1430.4s)]
*  And one year later, what is the status of Saudi-Iranian relations? [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1435.04s)]
*  Has there been any kind of fundamental transformation because of this agreement? [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1440.56s)]
*  Well, I'm sure you recall over four years ago when General Soleimani, General Qassem Soleimani, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1448.64s)]
*  was murdered by Trump and the Americans, he was on his way to see the Iraqi prime minister. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1456.96s)]
*  He traveled from Syria to Baghdad. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1467.76s)]
*  He was at the Baghdad International Airport, leaving the airport, because hours later he [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1470.24s)]
*  was supposed to see the prime minister, I think, at eight in the morning, [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1475.6s)]
*  Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi at that time. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1481.4399999999998s)]
*  So the Saudis had sent a message to the Iraqis about rapprochement. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1485.9199999999998s)]
*  And General Soleimani went to Iraq to go and visit the prime minister and discuss rapprochement [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1494.8s)]
*  with the Saudis. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1501.6799999999998s)]
*  And of course, the Americans knew this because the Americans have infiltrated [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1503.2s)]
*  all parts of the Iraqi state. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1507.2s)]
*  So part of the reason why the Americans, at least one reason why they murdered General [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1510.72s)]
*  Soleimani was because they wanted to prevent rapprochement between Iran and Saudi Arabia. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1516.0s)]
*  Now, since then, the Iranians and the Saudis had a series of negotiations [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1522.24s)]
*  and in different countries, but there was a sticking point that prevented the two countries [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1529.44s)]
*  from reopening the embassy. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1538.24s)]
*  And that was that the Saudis wanted Iran to negotiate on behalf of Ansarullah, [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1539.68s)]
*  effectively the government in Yemen, because they control the capital, the 70 to 80% of [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1547.84s)]
*  the population lives under the area controlled by Ansarullah. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1557.6799999999998s)]
*  So they are effectively the government in Yemen. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1562.56s)]
*  The Saudis wanted the Iranians to negotiate on their behalf. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1564.9599999999998s)]
*  But the Iranians said, we won't negotiate. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1569.04s)]
*  You have to negotiate with them directly. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1570.8799999999999s)]
*  It is not our business to cut a deal on anyone else's behalf. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1573.6s)]
*  And this is an important point because the West and some of their regional proxies, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1578.56s)]
*  they like to say that Ansarullah or Hezbollah or Hamas or Islamic Jihad, these are Iranian [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1584.4s)]
*  proxies. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1590.8s)]
*  And that I believe is one reason why they always miscalculate because proxies are like [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1591.84s)]
*  mercenaries. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1597.36s)]
*  If you cut their funding, they collapse. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1598.64s)]
*  But these are Iranian allies. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1602.32s)]
*  And their world view is similar to that of Iran. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1605.68s)]
*  They're anti-colonial, they're anti-imperial. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1609.2s)]
*  They're anti-hegemonic, they oppose Western hegemony, and they support the liberation [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1612.24s)]
*  of Palestine. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1617.68s)]
*  So Iran said, we cannot negotiate on behalf of Ansarullah. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1619.44s)]
*  And that remained a sticking point. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1624.8s)]
*  Then later, when the Chinese president, President Xi, went to Saudi Arabia, the Saudis asked [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1626.72s)]
*  him to mediate. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1635.36s)]
*  Soon after that, the Iranian president was to travel to China. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1636.16s)]
*  And before his trip, the Chinese sent a message to him asking if Iran would be willing for [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1641.52s)]
*  the Chinese to mediate. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1647.6000000000001s)]
*  And the Iranian president during his talks in China said that we support the initiative. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1648.5600000000002s)]
*  So after that, the Iranians and the Saudis sent a message to him. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1655.52s)]
*  Sent delegations to China and negotiated in Beijing. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1665.52s)]
*  And the Saudis removed that precondition about Yemen. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1670.24s)]
*  And ties were restored. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1677.28s)]
*  And since then, I think the Iranian president and Mohammed bin Salman, they had two phone [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1680.48s)]
*  conversations and they also met in Jeddah during the conference where the heads of the [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1687.12s)]
*  state of the Islamic world came together to discuss Gaza. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1696.9599999999998s)]
*  And of course, nothing came out of it. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1699.76s)]
*  But the point is that relations between the two countries are much better now. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1702.1599999999999s)]
*  Now, it's not as if the relationship is ideal. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1711.9199999999998s)]
*  There's not much economic trade going on between the two. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1715.92s)]
*  Things are happening, but not that rapidly. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1719.2s)]
*  And of course, Iran's position on Palestine is unique. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1723.3600000000001s)]
*  Iran does not believe in the two-state solution. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1730.56s)]
*  Iran, from the beginning, before the revolution, the revolutionaries led by Ayatollah Khomeini, [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1733.2s)]
*  Imam Khomeini, they believed there were two global issues that were very important for them. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1742.6399999999999s)]
*  One was South Africa and the other was Palestine. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1748.6399999999999s)]
*  And in both cases, they believed that these apartheid regimes must come to an end. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1752.0s)]
*  So immediately after the revolution, Iran broke off ties with South Africa and with Israel. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1756.9599999999998s)]
*  And Iran began to support the resistance movements in South Africa and in Palestine. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1763.1999999999998s)]
*  The PLO and Yasser Arafat and other groups began to receive funding and support from Iran. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1770.0s)]
*  And then later on, as Hamas grew and Islamic Jihad grew, they and other groups were supported. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1777.2s)]
*  And the same was true in South Africa. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1784.32s)]
*  The ANC, the Pan-African Congress, and other groups were supported by Iran. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1785.92s)]
*  The military wing of the ANC was funded by Iran. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1790.8s)]
*  And of course, when the South African regime collapsed, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1795.76s)]
*  the Iranians established diplomatic ties. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1800.32s)]
*  And Nelson Mandela, one of the first things that he did was he traveled to Iran and other countries [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1804.64s)]
*  that supported the people of South Africa. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1810.56s)]
*  So the Iranian position on Palestine is different from that of Saudi Arabia. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1815.76s)]
*  And of course, Saudi Arabia, as you know, has major differences with Hamas [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1825.68s)]
*  and the resistance movements in Palestine. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1835.1200000000001s)]
*  So I don't think that there is much coordination there between the two. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1839.1200000000001s)]
*  But the more the Saudi Arabian state can be drawn away from the American camp, [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1844.96s)]
*  the better I think it is for Saudi Arabia, but also I think the better it is for [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1851.84s)]
*  the region and for the Palestinian people. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1857.2s)]
*  But what I would like to point out is that the problem, the United States, let us assume [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1864.08s)]
*  that they do succeed in normalizing ties between Saudi Arabia and Israel. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1871.2s)]
*  I don't think that that's going to change anything. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1877.28s)]
*  Saudi Arabia cannot bring back legitimacy to Israel. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1882.0s)]
*  Israel has damaged goods. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1886.8799999999999s)]
*  Israel is not the Israel that people perceived it to be before. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1889.28s)]
*  In the past, many thought that Israel was this undefeatable regime, high tech. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1894.32s)]
*  They knew exactly what was going on. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1900.8799999999999s)]
*  Their intelligence gathering was second to none. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1903.12s)]
*  Their military was invincible. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1905.76s)]
*  Now, they're a diminished regime. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1908.24s)]
*  They're unpopular across the world. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1911.4399999999998s)]
*  They're despised. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1913.36s)]
*  The regime is despised. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1914.32s)]
*  Its intelligence gathering has been exposed as deeply flawed, to say the least. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1916.72s)]
*  Its military capability has been exposed as weak and inadequate. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1924.8s)]
*  The regime has shown itself to be utterly hypocritical and more importantly, barbaric. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1930.3999999999999s)]
*  And inhumane. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1936.24s)]
*  So who would benefit by normalizing ties with the regime? [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1937.84s)]
*  It would only make things worse for Saudi Arabia now. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1943.92s)]
*  Anyone who touches the regime would lose credibility in the eyes of its own public. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1947.68s)]
*  I believe that the Emirates regrets what it has done in the past, but it cannot reverse [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1954.8s)]
*  it because it would look bad for the regime. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1960.72s)]
*  I have no doubt, even though the Emirates is a police state, if you ask people and people [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1962.72s)]
*  are able to express themselves in the United Arab Emirates, they would say we want to wreck [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1966.8000000000002s)]
*  the relationship with the regime. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1974.16s)]
*  The same is true in Saudi Arabia. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1975.92s)]
*  The same is true across the Persian Gulf region and beyond. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1977.3600000000001s)]
*  And as we speak, those regimes that are complicit, they're losing credibility. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1983.1200000000001s)]
*  Look at Turkey. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1989.68s)]
*  Erdogan was funding ISIS and al-Qaeda and demolishing Syria. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1990.3200000000002s)]
*  He was prepared to do anything to take Damascus. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=1996.5600000000002s)]
*  But when it comes to Gaza, he does nothing. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2001.2800000000002s)]
*  He continues to do trade with the regime. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2004.64s)]
*  Part of the reason why he lost the election was because of Gaza. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2009.2s)]
*  Part of it, there are other reasons. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2014.16s)]
*  That's certainly one analysis that his party lost votes to a relatively new Islamist party that [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2016.16s)]
*  was calling for the complete cutoff of ties with Israel, something that Turkey unfortunately [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2031.28s)]
*  hasn't done. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2038.48s)]
*  I want to ask you, again touching on some of the points you raised, anyone of us who lives in the [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2039.52s)]
*  West, and sadly this is true in many Arab countries as well, is subjected to constant propaganda, [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2044.32s)]
*  often seeped in open sectarianism, claiming that Iran is an aggressive country that is [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2052.8s)]
*  not going to be able to do anything. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2056.0s)]
*  And I think that's a very important point. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2058.0s)]
*  And I think that's a very important point. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2060.0s)]
*  And I think that's a very important point. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2062.0s)]
*  Open sectarianism, claiming that Iran is an aggressive country that aims to take over the [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2064.64s)]
*  region, spread Shia Islam, and undermine the existing order. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2070.48s)]
*  And in fact, just in recent days, in the context of the enormous protests in Jordan, [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2075.2s)]
*  in solidarity with people in Palestine, we've heard voices close to the authorities there claiming [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2084.0s)]
*  that these huge protests and rallies serve foreign interests and with hints at Iran. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2093.2s)]
*  And we even hear such things from people close to the Palestinian Authority and across the region. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2101.7599999999998s)]
*  I just want to give you a chance to respond to that because it's such a pervasive theme in so [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2108.24s)]
*  much of what we hear. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2114.64s)]
*  Is Iran a menace to the region? [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2116.08s)]
*  Is it trying to impose the Shia beliefs on a billion plus Sunni Muslims around the world? [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2119.2s)]
*  Is that what's going on here? [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2129.52s)]
*  Well, in the good old days, during the Bush years, we were the axis of evil. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2132.72s)]
*  And we were at the top of the list. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2140.96s)]
*  Unfortunately, we have rivals like China and Russia. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2144.56s)]
*  And we're sometimes ignored in the West. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2148.56s)]
*  And our evilness doesn't count for as much as before. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2151.44s)]
*  So it's always good to hear these people speak about the evilness of Iran. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2155.1200000000003s)]
*  It reminds us of those good old days of George Bush. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2163.92s)]
*  But I think it's quite clear that these regimes use these tropes simply for self-interest. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2169.84s)]
*  They are complicit in this genocide. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2181.84s)]
*  And they want to otherize Iran to draw attention away from the real issue. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2185.2s)]
*  Of course, these protests are serving the interests of a foreign country. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2189.76s)]
*  It's serving the interests of the Palestinian nation. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2195.44s)]
*  It's serving the interests of the people of Gaza and the West Bank and those in [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2198.64s)]
*  Israel, 1967, who are less than second-class citizens. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2206.48s)]
*  It serves their interests. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2213.04s)]
*  It serves the interests of humanity. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2214.56s)]
*  But these regimes, by otherizing Iran, they do the same thing that George Bush did. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2217.3599999999997s)]
*  They need enemies in order to justify their policies. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2225.92s)]
*  Iran is an axis. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2230.88s)]
*  I mean, back then, you recall, it was the Soviet Union had collapsed. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2232.2400000000002s)]
*  The United States was the, it was the unipolar moment. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2239.76s)]
*  If you recall, it was the end of history as Fukuyama and many others believed. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2245.36s)]
*  And even after Fukuyama retreated from that position, [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2249.76s)]
*  it was still the mentality that existed in the West. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2253.2799999999997s)]
*  At that time, they needed to demonize Iran because it served their agenda in our region. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2259.04s)]
*  And the same is true with these regimes for their own more, let's say, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2268.8799999999997s)]
*  Parochial or local. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2274.8799999999997s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2276.56s)]
*  But let me just add one sentence. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2279.12s)]
*  And that is that Iran, no country has willingly sacrificed as much as Iran for the Palestinian [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2281.6s)]
*  cause. Lebanon has sacrificed a lot. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2291.52s)]
*  The Israelis invaded it. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2296.56s)]
*  They attack it. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2298.16s)]
*  Syria, the dirty war and the occupation of the Golan Heights, great sacrifice. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2298.96s)]
*  The Palestinian people, the ultimate sacrifice. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2305.6s)]
*  There's no doubt about it. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2310.24s)]
*  But Iran chose to make sacrifice for the Palestinian cause over the decades. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2311.7599999999998s)]
*  That is why Iran has been sanctioned for decades. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2318.64s)]
*  That is why maximum pressure sanctions were imposed on Iran. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2322.7999999999997s)]
*  It has nothing to do with Iran's nuclear program or human rights or whatever it is [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2326.48s)]
*  that the Americans and the Europeans use to sanction Iran terrorism and tomorrow will be [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2331.52s)]
*  global warming or whatever. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2336.08s)]
*  The real reason is because Iran supports the Palestinian cause. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2338.48s)]
*  Let us imagine if Iran wanted to gain from this, if Iran wanted to gain a lot, what would [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2342.2400000000002s)]
*  it do right now? [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2353.36s)]
*  If it was if it was just self-interest, if it was just Iranian selfishness trying to [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2354.96s)]
*  exploit the region for its own gain. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2360.48s)]
*  Do you think at this moment when the Israeli regime is floundering that the Americans [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2363.68s)]
*  would not be willing to give Iran the world? [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2369.4399999999996s)]
*  If Iran, if the Iranians were willing to relinquish their support for the resistance, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2374.72s)]
*  their military support, just their military support, and then they continue to support [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2381.6s)]
*  them verbally like Mr. Erdogan and others. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2387.3599999999997s)]
*  What do you think the Americans would be willing to give to Iran? [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2390.64s)]
*  I think they give Iran quite a lot, but Iran would never think about it. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2394.24s)]
*  Anyone who, as I said, anyone who goes and looks into Iranian history before the [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2401.68s)]
*  revolution, Ayatollah Khomeini, Imam Khomeini, his companions, the movements, the parties, [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2405.52s)]
*  the issue of Palestine and South Africa was a part of the revolution from the very beginning. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2412.16s)]
*  These were key issues. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2419.68s)]
*  Now, if you cast your mind back to the so-called Green Revolution, which was, I suppose we [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2422.64s)]
*  could call it in hindsight, the regime change attempt that was sponsored by, I mean, [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2430.56s)]
*  literally sponsored by the State Department under Hillary Clinton in the early days of [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2436.3199999999997s)]
*  the Obama administration. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2442.0s)]
*  And people on social media were changing their profile pics to green in order to show their [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2444.0800000000004s)]
*  support. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2452.5600000000004s)]
*  As always happens in these cases, there are sort of video clips that circulate that, allegedly, [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2455.6000000000004s)]
*  because we can't really verify or trust what is shown. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2465.6s)]
*  And especially since at that time, it was very explicit that Twitter was working and they were [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2472.96s)]
*  very proud of this with the State Department to promote these protests in Iran. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2479.2s)]
*  And one of the slogans that we were told was coming out of these protests was that, you know, [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2484.88s)]
*  poor, hungry Iranians were resentful that all this money and support was going to Palestine instead [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2495.12s)]
*  of to the Iranian people. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2502.08s)]
*  In other words, there was an effort to present Iran's support for Palestine as an elite project [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2503.36s)]
*  disconnected from the needs and desires of the masses of the Iranian people. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2510.4s)]
*  And I think those attempts are still made. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2516.96s)]
*  Tell us more about, you're in Tehran, what is the popular, what is the social understanding [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2519.92s)]
*  and connection with the cause of Palestine, particularly with what's happening in Gaza [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2531.36s)]
*  right now? [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2535.6000000000004s)]
*  Iran has always been a diverse country with diverse views. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2538.1600000000003s)]
*  And contrary to what many, well, I think overwhelmingly people in the West think, largely [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2546.4s)]
*  because of the Western media, people in Iran express their views very openly. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2552.64s)]
*  Many at university, colleagues are opposed to spending money for Hamas or Islamic Jihad. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2558.0s)]
*  During that, the 2009, after the presidential election, and when the riots began, the protests [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2566.88s)]
*  and the riots and the protests and the riots, one slogan was no to Gaza, no to Lebanon. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2580.24s)]
*  So these people were saying that we want to cut off support for these resistance movements. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2586.8s)]
*  That exists today among a segment of Iranian society. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2597.84s)]
*  But overwhelmingly, Iranians are sympathetic towards the Palestinians. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2604.24s)]
*  And even those who took part in 2009 in the riots and the protests, not all of them believed [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2611.04s)]
*  in such a slogan. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2618.88s)]
*  Some people were, they made some of them, many of them were against President Ahmadinejad [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2619.7599999999998s)]
*  at that time. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2625.84s)]
*  I mean, I was no fan of his either, although he won the election fair and square, but I [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2626.32s)]
*  never was interested in him. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2631.2799999999997s)]
*  But many who were opposed to him were not opposed to Gaza and Lebanon. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2634.4s)]
*  But of course, the Western media, they will pick and choose whatever images they want [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2640.0s)]
*  and present it. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2645.52s)]
*  It's sort of like in Paris, if the police are beating people on the heads with batons, [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2646.4s)]
*  they'll say the rioters are a threat to the security of the people of France. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2651.52s)]
*  But if police in Iran are hitting people with batons, they'll say look at the brutal criminal [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2657.68s)]
*  Iranian regime beating innocent Iranian protesters. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2662.88s)]
*  The same image would have two completely different interpretations given by, presented by the [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2668.8s)]
*  Western media. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2679.2000000000003s)]
*  So these sound bites create the image that those who were protesting against Ahmadinejad [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2679.84s)]
*  were all against Palestine and Gaza, which is absolutely untrue. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2686.88s)]
*  But there were those and there are those today who say that why should we get involved? [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2691.92s)]
*  We have our own troubles. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2696.8s)]
*  But when you look at the polls consistently throughout the years, and polls are taken not [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2698.8s)]
*  by Iranian institutions, but by Western institutions, the support for the Palestinian people is [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2704.4s)]
*  overwhelming. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2710.5600000000004s)]
*  The degree to which people, Iran should support the resistance groups, some say we should [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2711.6000000000004s)]
*  do more, some say what we're doing now is adequate, some say we should do less. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2719.2000000000003s)]
*  But the support for the Palestinians is almost universal. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2724.32s)]
*  And those who want Iran to support, meaning fund and aid the Palestinian cause financially, [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2729.84s)]
*  is a huge majority. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2740.72s)]
*  It's a huge majority. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2743.52s)]
*  So sympathy is almost universal. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2746.56s)]
*  And a huge majority supports Iran's, let's say, material support for the resistance. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2750.56s)]
*  Though, as I said, there are different views on how much and how, but for the most part, [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2759.2s)]
*  people support Iran's policy. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2764.56s)]
*  And that is especially true after Gaza. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2766.24s)]
*  I know colleagues, I have colleagues and friends who before would say, [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2770.3199999999997s)]
*  you know, we have to accept the two-state solution. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2775.92s)]
*  And by the way, the Iranian position is that if the Palestinians collectively, meaning [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2779.36s)]
*  the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank and inside what is now called Israel, and [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2786.7200000000003s)]
*  those in the refugee camps collectively agree to a two-state solution with Israel, Iran [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2793.1200000000003s)]
*  will not block it. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2800.32s)]
*  Iran will not impede it. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2801.76s)]
*  But Iran will not accept the legitimacy of the regime on principle. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2803.44s)]
*  But Iran believes in one state solution. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2809.04s)]
*  It always did it and continues to do so. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2811.1200000000003s)]
*  So, you know, that I should have, I think that footnote was necessary. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2813.76s)]
*  But overwhelmingly, Iranians support this. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2819.92s)]
*  And as I said, after the genocide in Gaza, colleagues of mine and friends of mine who [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2825.84s)]
*  before were saying there should be a two-state solution, many of them, I think everyone who [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2831.12s)]
*  I've spoken to says, no, this regime cannot be tolerated anymore. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2836.48s)]
*  This is not a regime that can, is accepted, we should accept it or allow to exist in the [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2841.8399999999997s)]
*  region any longer. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2847.92s)]
*  So what the regime has done is that it has not only diminished its credibility across [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2849.52s)]
*  the world and its image across the world, but even among those, the minority of those who thought [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2857.6s)]
*  that there are some sort of agreement could be reached with the regime in Iran, even those [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2866.16s)]
*  numbers, that group has diminished inside the country, inside Iran, their numbers. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2871.52s)]
*  It's interesting that you made reference to the polls that are taken by Western, you know, [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2878.7200000000003s)]
*  Western think tanks, for example, the Pew Global Research Center. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2885.84s)]
*  I don't know if they do polls in Iran, but they do polls in other countries across the region. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2890.48s)]
*  And I look at them from time to time. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2896.7200000000003s)]
*  And I don't think I've seen a recent one, at least since the genocide in Gaza began. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2898.64s)]
*  But over the years, it was remarkable how unsuccessful the sectarian incitement [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2905.28s)]
*  targeting Iran was, for example, consistently in Jordan, to take just one country, but there [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2913.92s)]
*  were other countries as well, you'd find that despite intense propaganda, particularly in [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2921.6800000000003s)]
*  international media, telling people, and in Saudi media, telling people, [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2928.4s)]
*  Israel isn't the real threat, the real threat is Iran. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2935.6800000000003s)]
*  People didn't buy it. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2939.28s)]
*  People in Jordan by huge margins, like 90% said, no, the main threat is the United States [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2940.56s)]
*  and Israel, not Iran. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2948.32s)]
*  And people at the popular level appreciate that, you know, they want to see support for [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2951.68s)]
*  resistance. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2960.4s)]
*  And I think they would appreciate any country that provided that kind of support that we've [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2960.96s)]
*  spoken about. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2969.6s)]
*  So I just wanted to underscore how unsuccessful the propaganda has been. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2970.56s)]
*  And I think if those polls were taken today, those numbers would be even more overwhelming. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2976.4s)]
*  And I think that just adds something when you say even more overwhelming. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2981.84s)]
*  Support for the Palestinian cause and the Palestinian people in Iran is very high, and [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2988.32s)]
*  that is despite the maximum pressure sanctions. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2992.88s)]
*  The Americans have done everything and the Europeans everything possible to make life [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=2995.6s)]
*  difficult for ordinary Iranians. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3000.32s)]
*  And under such circumstances, it's more understandable when people say, well, the focus [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3002.64s)]
*  should be on inside the country. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3007.68s)]
*  And there is something unique about Iran that does not exist anywhere else in the world. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3009.8399999999997s)]
*  And that is there are a huge number of media outlets in Persian that are hostile to Iran, [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3017.04s)]
*  broadcast from outside. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3025.2799999999997s)]
*  We have more political media outlets outside of Iran in Persian, hostile to Iran, than [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3027.12s)]
*  we have inside Iran. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3033.44s)]
*  So people in Iran day and night, they hear anti-Iranian propaganda from BBC Persian, VOA [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3036.0s)]
*  Persian, Deutsche Welle, France Radio International, television channels like Iran International, [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3043.7599999999998s)]
*  Manotu, which I think recently was shut down, and all sorts of telegram channels, which [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3054.0s)]
*  all of these are funded by Western governments and Israel. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3059.2799999999997s)]
*  Previously Saudi Arabia as well, but I think the Saudis have stopped, or at least they've [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3064.56s)]
*  cut their support significantly. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3069.92s)]
*  And then you have cyber armies, such as in Albania, where thousands of these MEK terrorists [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3072.88s)]
*  who fought alongside Saddam Hussein against their own country in the 1980s. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3079.2s)]
*  The Americans took them there and they've created a cyber army there. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3083.52s)]
*  So day and night, they are each of them have tens of accounts and they're online there. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3087.04s)]
*  You know, they attack Iran. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3093.4399999999996s)]
*  So you have these huge spots and cyber armies and media outlets day and night telling the [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3097.2s)]
*  Iranian people that you are the most miserable people in this world. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3103.12s)]
*  You're the most impoverished people. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3107.04s)]
*  I have students at the University of Tehran who in class sometimes tell me the most extraordinary [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3108.56s)]
*  things. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3115.7599999999998s)]
*  They say, you know, we're the most impoverished country in the world. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3116.08s)]
*  We are, you know, we have no freedom. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3119.52s)]
*  And I said, and I tell them in class, well, you know, when you say you have no freedom, [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3122.32s)]
*  you can't say that in the Emirates. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3126.96s)]
*  You can't say that in Qatar. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3128.96s)]
*  You cannot say that in Saudi Arabia. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3132.48s)]
*  You cannot say that in Afghanistan. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3134.4s)]
*  You cannot, you know, but the Western, so on the one hand, the Western propaganda machine [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3136.16s)]
*  is not only antagonizing Iran across the world, but it's also trying to create depression [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3143.2s)]
*  and division and a sense of hopelessness among ordinary Iranians day and night as they [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3151.44s)]
*  impose maximum pressure. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3158.8799999999997s)]
*  But despite all that and despite the fact that the, you know, many, many Iranians are [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3160.8799999999997s)]
*  facing difficulty because of all this, you still see that in the polls, Iranians overwhelmingly [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3170.08s)]
*  support Palestine. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3178.08s)]
*  And I think maybe the University of Maryland, I know that they do polls in Iran, people [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3180.08s)]
*  maybe they could look that up. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3186.48s)]
*  And there are other institutions as well. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3188.72s)]
*  People want to do research on that front. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3191.44s)]
*  That doesn't, and in Iran, by the way, if you just come to Iran and you take a taxi [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3193.9199999999996s)]
*  or take a few, and then take the metro and go around town, take the bus, you'll see you [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3200.3199999999997s)]
*  have people in taxis, not now, since I was a teenager, since I remember. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3206.3999999999996s)]
*  People would insult the government, the leader, religion. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3211.52s)]
*  It's very, it's not the sort of world that has been created by the Western media. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3216.56s)]
*  In fact, whenever a Western journalist comes to Iran, and we have, let's say, we have long [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3226.32s)]
*  conversations together, or wherever an academic from the West comes to Iran, let's say we [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3232.56s)]
*  invite them over. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3238.56s)]
*  And I have serious discussions with them. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3239.76s)]
*  One of the things that I often ask is how different is Iran from what you thought it [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3242.48s)]
*  would be? [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3247.5200000000004s)]
*  And they all, I don't remember anyone saying that it's the same. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3248.32s)]
*  Universally, they say it's completely different from what they expected. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3252.96s)]
*  So Iran is a very dynamic society. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3259.76s)]
*  Tehran is very dynamic. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3263.5200000000004s)]
*  Iran is very dynamic. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3264.96s)]
*  There are many different political views. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3266.6400000000003s)]
*  There are people who oppose the Islamic Republic. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3268.8s)]
*  There are people who overwhelmingly support the Islamic Republic of Iran. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3271.44s)]
*  But even among those supporters, there are huge differences. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3278.48s)]
*  And with regards to policy, with regards to the decisions made by the state, there are [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3281.76s)]
*  many differing views in Iran. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3288.0s)]
*  There, you can, at Iranian, and I'm not saying Iran is a utopia. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3290.48s)]
*  Iran has many problems, without a doubt. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3295.76s)]
*  But you can support Israel, an academic or students in class can support Israel in class [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3299.84s)]
*  much more easily than an academic can support, I believe, can support Palestine in classes [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3310.88s)]
*  at universities in the United States. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3321.1200000000003s)]
*  I'm, well, I can't bet on it. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3323.84s)]
*  I'm a practicing Muslim. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3326.16s)]
*  But I think that I can say that with confidence. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3328.16s)]
*  So I'm not saying that Iran is ideal. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3331.44s)]
*  I'm not saying it's a utopia. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3333.6s)]
*  I'm not saying the state gets everything right. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3335.04s)]
*  There are many problems in Iran. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3338.08s)]
*  And I disagree with many policies of this administration, the previous administration, [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3340.24s)]
*  just like everyone else does. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3344.4s)]
*  I support many things about it. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3346.16s)]
*  But it is definitely not the dystopia that has been created in the mind of so many people [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3347.7599999999998s)]
*  in the West. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3354.0s)]
*  And I think now that people in the West have seen how dishonest the Western media is, the [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3354.56s)]
*  Western media is hiding a genocide. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3359.68s)]
*  The Western media is supporting a genocide. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3362.08s)]
*  Now that people see how dishonest the Western media is, maybe they should start rethinking [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3364.48s)]
*  a bit about the propaganda against Iran. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3369.52s)]
*  I think that's a very good point. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3374.16s)]
*  We just have a couple of minutes. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3376.88s)]
*  But one thing I want to ask you about is, in conversations that we've had on the Electronic [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3378.56s)]
*  Interfada live stream and that I've had with people since the start of this genocide, [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3386.88s)]
*  and I've been asked this question, like, are you surprised by Israel's barbarism and savagery? [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3394.48s)]
*  And my answer has been, I always knew that Israel had the desire, had the will, had the [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3400.8799999999997s)]
*  capability to perpetrate genocide. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3411.68s)]
*  They've never hidden it. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3414.16s)]
*  And it's been their practice since the creation of the entity, the creation of Israel over [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3415.2799999999997s)]
*  the ruins of Palestine. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3423.2s)]
*  But even for all my knowledge of the duplicity and hypocrisy of the West, I've had to admit, [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3425.52s)]
*  and I've had friends and colleagues in Gaza admit, we didn't expect that Israel would be [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3435.2799999999997s)]
*  allowed by the so-called international community, by the West, to go as far as it has in just [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3441.52s)]
*  utter barbarity and savagery. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3450.16s)]
*  I know that you've spoken about and written about your experiences, a youth during the [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3453.28s)]
*  Iran-Iraq war and having been gassed, and many Iranian soldiers were gassed. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3461.44s)]
*  I remember, I was as a teenager living in Europe at the time, and I remember the television would [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3471.2000000000003s)]
*  show young Iranian soldiers being brought to European countries for treatment with, [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3477.76s)]
*  I can't remember if it was to European countries, but they were being transported- [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3487.36s)]
*  Off into Germany. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3490.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3492.48s)]
*  They were being transported out of Iran for treatment of mustard gas burns and burns that, [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3494.2400000000002s)]
*  the kinds of injuries that were common during the First World War before gas had been [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3504.48s)]
*  banned as a weapon. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3514.88s)]
*  It turns out that much of this gas, or at least what they call the precursors to these chemical [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3520.1600000000003s)]
*  weapons which were used against you and so many other Iranians, came from Europe and came from [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3527.84s)]
*  specifically from Germany, a country which has an unfortunate expertise in producing poison gas. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3534.6400000000003s)]
*  With you having had that experience and your great knowledge, I suppose I'm asking a very [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3545.6800000000003s)]
*  loaded question. Are you surprised by the level of barbarity and savagery that Israel is [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3550.96s)]
*  perpetrating? Are you surprised by the western response to it? [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3560.7200000000003s)]
*  That's a difficult question to answer. I, as you rightly pointed out, I survived two chemical [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3572.32s)]
*  attacks. One was when nerve agents were used and the other was mustard gas. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3580.24s)]
*  For me, mustard gas was very fearful because during the war I had an experience going to [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3595.2799999999997s)]
*  a hospital where there were lots of patients who were injured with mustard gas and their injuries [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3603.2799999999997s)]
*  were horrific. Many died after five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five years after the event, after [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3610.0s)]
*  the gas attack. Many are dying as we speak now because in some cases it's a very slow death and [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3623.6s)]
*  it's a torturous death. So when I went to that hospital, after I went to the hospital to help, [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3630.4s)]
*  I didn't do much, but anyway, but it had a lasting impression on me and near the end of the war when [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3640.7200000000003s)]
*  I was injured with mustard gas, I was worried that I would suffer like those people in the hospital. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3648.8s)]
*  So it was quite frightening. Also, I went to Halabjid right after the attack, but I don't want [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3656.56s)]
*  to go into that. I know we've run out of time. I should also add that the reason why Iranians [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3667.92s)]
*  were taken to Europe and mostly Germany, the Iranian government sent them. The Germans, [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3673.92s)]
*  they weren't doing Iran any favors. Iran intentionally sent injured people to these countries [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3679.12s)]
*  to great awareness about what their governments were doing. And that worked? [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3685.2799999999997s)]
*  It worked to a degree, but in general the West was unwilling to do anything about it. They continued [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3689.68s)]
*  to supply the regime Saddam Hussein with chemical weapons. They provided him with the military [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3698.32s)]
*  intelligence, especially the Americans, to use those chemical weapons and they provided the [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3705.36s)]
*  political cover to get away with it. And in some cases, the United States, and I think this was [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3710.72s)]
*  written in a 2003 article in the New York Times, I forget the name of the author, but the United, [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3716.56s)]
*  the government, the US government at that time, the Reagan administration or regime, they [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3723.2s)]
*  instructed the state departments to try to blame Iran for the acid attacks if possible. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3732.48s)]
*  So they were trying to blame the victim. So there was no real outrage. The policy continued. And so [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3737.68s)]
*  for me, it has always been clear that the West is barbaric, Western regimes. And of course, all of [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3743.84s)]
*  us, we're all students of history, Africa, South Africa, the Congo, Algeria, Latin America, [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3753.36s)]
*  you know, the Indian subcontinent, East Asia, the history of colonialism and neo-colonialism, [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3763.36s)]
*  is, you know, we all know a thing or two about it. So this is nothing really new. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3772.1600000000003s)]
*  Even though it was personal for me, it was not new. It was something that had been going on [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3781.04s)]
*  for centuries. But what is unique, and this is my response, I believed that the Israeli regime [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3786.0800000000004s)]
*  would like to carry out this genocide. And I believed that the West would support the genocide. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3795.6000000000004s)]
*  But I didn't think that they would be prepared to go this far [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3804.6400000000003s)]
*  while this genocide was being carried out in front of a global audience. This genocide is [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3812.8s)]
*  unique in human history. This Holocaust is unique because we are watching it as it happens. When I [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3821.1200000000003s)]
*  wake up in the morning, literally, the first thing I do is I check the news and I see new footage of [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3830.48s)]
*  death and destruction. When I go to bed at night, almost, again, literally, one of the last things [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3839.28s)]
*  I do is I go and check the latest atrocity carried out by the regime that, you know, that [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3845.6000000000004s)]
*  was carried out sometimes minutes before I saw it. I would have thought that under these [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3856.4s)]
*  circumstances, the West would have distanced themselves from the regime, or at least they [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3865.52s)]
*  would have pretended to be opposed to the genocide. They would have condemned the Israelis, [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3870.08s)]
*  but they would have allowed them to do what they did. Otherwise, the Israelis have carried out [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3875.7599999999998s)]
*  genocide before. You know what happened in Sabra and Shatila in 1982 when the Israelis invaded [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3879.7599999999998s)]
*  Lebanon. I think between 20,000 to 40,000 people were killed. And in Sabra and Shatila, 2,000 to [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3884.88s)]
*  3,000 Palestinians and some Lebanese were killed within 36 hours. So they do these things. And the [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3891.2799999999997s)]
*  West never condemned them. They never sanctioned them. But back then, these things weren't, you [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3898.7999999999997s)]
*  know, you didn't see them happen or you didn't see the footage. They weren't live streamed. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3904.96s)]
*  People are literally live streaming. They were literally live streaming. They were live streaming. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3911.2799999999997s)]
*  They weren't live streamed. They weren't live streaming. People are literally live streaming [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3917.6s)]
*  genocide. This to me is the most outrageous part of this whole catastrophe. But these same powers [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3921.68s)]
*  will still come and lecture us about women's rights in Iran and human rights here and human [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3935.52s)]
*  rights there. And I think that, you know, that, also the legitimacy they had to lecture anyone [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3941.2s)]
*  about human rights was already threadbare. And the world was already fed up with it. But I think [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3952.72s)]
*  after this, I can't see how, you know, even with their own people, I think they've lost, you know, [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3959.12s)]
*  the Western governments had already, the rest of the world was already losing patience with them [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3966.8s)]
*  and their lectures and their sanctimony. But I think now their own people understand, you know, [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3975.2000000000003s)]
*  that we're being ruled in the West by psychopaths, people who have no hint of human feeling or [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3982.1600000000003s)]
*  decency or empathy. And to imagine oneself to be in a position where you could stop something like [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3990.4s)]
*  this and you don't. You could stop, they could stop it immediately. Yeah. And to not do that, [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=3998.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean, is just, it's just extraordinary. And two things here though, that I'd like to just add. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4004.56s)]
*  One is that the Israeli regime is, its existence is detrimental to the West and that has been [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4011.92s)]
*  exposed to everyone. The West has its soft power and its credibility and image has been demolished [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4020.16s)]
*  across the globe because of their policy towards Gaza, because of their policy towards Israel and [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4026.72s)]
*  the Palestinian people. They've destroyed, they've wrecked their image across the globe over the past [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4032.8799999999997s)]
*  six months. So Israel is destroying the West. But also on the bright side, I think one thing that [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4040.0s)]
*  you know better than I, and that is that young people, not only across the world, but in the West, [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4050.72s)]
*  Jews, Christians, Muslims, Hindus, every across all walks of life, they are waking up to this [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4056.56s)]
*  reality and they themselves are at the forefront of the resistance. The resistance that is being [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4068.16s)]
*  carried out in Gaza, Palestine, the region, the military resistance, the support that the [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4074.48s)]
*  people of the region give to the resistance, that's immensely important. But what the young [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4082.96s)]
*  people and older people in the United States and Europe are doing is very heroic. And I'm sure many [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4092.64s)]
*  of them are either paying a price or they know that they could pay a heavy price. And that is [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4100.32s)]
*  something that is very encouraging that we have so many people who have such a strong sense of [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4106.32s)]
*  humanity among the Jews. And we have to always keep in mind that Zionism has nothing to do with [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4112.639999999999s)]
*  Judaism. Most Zionists are actually Christians. Many are not even religious. Zionism, just like [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4118.639999999999s)]
*  ISIS, has nothing to do with Islam, just like the Nazis have nothing to do with Christianity, [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4124.56s)]
*  Zionism has nothing to do with Judaism. And I think many people recognize this. And especially [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4132.64s)]
*  I have to point out that those young Jews in the United States and in Europe, but especially I [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4142.4800000000005s)]
*  think in the United States, at least in our part of the world, their work is being reflected. And [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4148.56s)]
*  in the protests in London, they are themselves, I think the strongest force, those who are anti-Zionist, [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4155.52s)]
*  they are the strongest force that prevents people from, in our part of the world, from becoming [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4163.4400000000005s)]
*  anti-Semitic. Because, oh, whatever that may mean. People see that Jews are opposed to Zionism. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4169.92s)]
*  People see that Christians are opposed to Zionism. They are seeing now that the political regimes [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4177.52s)]
*  in the West are detached from the people. And the people now that they, many of them, are seeing [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4184.4s)]
*  through the propaganda, they are not only tilting away from the regime, but they are staunchly [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4190.4s)]
*  opposed to it. So I'm optimistic about the future. I'm not naive. I think the months, the weeks, [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4200.799999999999s)]
*  the months, the years ahead will have many challenges for the region and beyond. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4207.28s)]
*  We have simultaneously, we have Ukraine and the deterioration of security and the economy in [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4212.5599999999995s)]
*  Europe. The world is entering a very dangerous phase. But this Eurocentric world, this [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4219.68s)]
*  US dominated world order has to come to an end. It has to come to an end. But ultimately, I think [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4229.76s)]
*  that this will happen. And the Palestinian people will have liberation. And Palestine, [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4237.280000000001s)]
*  inshallah, will be a land where Jews, Christians, Muslims can all live as equal human beings across [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4245.92s)]
*  the land side by side. And people will see that the project of Zionism was not just detrimental [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4251.360000000001s)]
*  to the region, but it was detrimental to the Jewish people, to the interests of Jewish people [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4262.240000000001s)]
*  across the world. But again, I think young Jews in America, in the United States and in Europe, [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4268.72s)]
*  we have to, those who are standing up to the Israeli regime, we have to thank them [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4275.04s)]
*  probably more than anyone else. I think that's a very hopeful note to end on. And we need that. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4279.200000000001s)]
*  I could certainly talk to you for a lot longer, but it's very late in Tehran. And we're so grateful [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4289.12s)]
*  for your time. Dr. Mohammed Marandi, you are a professor of English literature and orientalism [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4294.16s)]
*  at the University of Tehran. And it's been my pleasure to talk to you on the Electronic [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4301.759999999999s)]
*  Intifada podcast. And I hope we can have you back soon. Finally, you are very active on [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4307.2s)]
*  social media and you write and contribute. Is there a specific place where people can [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4314.400000000001s)]
*  find your work? Well, I was removed from Facebook and Instagram a long time ago. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4321.6s)]
*  My accounts were deactivated. So I'm on Twitter. I wasn't really, I don't, I'm not a big fan of [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4329.76s)]
*  Twitter. But I think since the war in Gaza, I've been pretty active, more active than I should be, [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4337.4400000000005s)]
*  perhaps. But that's where they can find my material. I have a Twitter account, basically. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4345.4400000000005s)]
*  And I have to say it's a very good one with a lot of insight. And the other thing I mentioned in [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4351.68s)]
*  the beginning, and I strongly recommend this, you are just a fantastic, combative debater when you [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4356.64s)]
*  come onto BBC or CNN. BBC shows like hard talk. And I learned lessons from you for how to respond [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4363.36s)]
*  to the lies and propaganda. But we'll be happy to have you back on the Electronic [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2WNlRwoyUg&t=4371.28s)]
