# Teachers, parents fight Israel lobby smears against Berkeley schools | EI Podcast
**The Electronic Intifada:** [April 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM)
*  Welcome back to the Electronic Intifada podcast. I'm Nora Barrows Friedman. Two major Israel lobby [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=0.0s)]
*  organizations have joined forces to file a federal complaint against the Berkeley, California Unified [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  School District, alleging that administrators have ignored, quote, severe and persistent targeting [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=12.96s)]
*  of Jewish students over the last six months of Israel's genocide in Gaza. It's certainly not the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=19.36s)]
*  first time that the Louis D. Brandeis Center and the Anti-Defamation League, two right-wing [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=25.2s)]
*  anti-Palestinian lobby organizations masquerading as civil rights groups, have filed legal complaints [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=30.64s)]
*  to the U.S. Department of Education, claiming that Palestine solidarity activism on U.S. campuses [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=37.2s)]
*  somehow is a threat to Jewish students, but it is the first time that such a complaint has been filed [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=42.96s)]
*  against a K-12 school district since October 7th. Of course, Kenneth Marcus, the head of the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=48.559999999999995s)]
*  Brandeis Center, served as the head of the Office for Civil Rights under the Trump administration [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=55.279999999999994s)]
*  and was tasked with adjudicating such complaints at the Department of Education, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=60.64s)]
*  complaints that he himself pioneered at the Brandeis Center and encouraged other Israel [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=65.36s)]
*  lobby organizations how to do so. Marcus, of course, resigned in July 2020 after it was [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=70.64s)]
*  revealed by real civil rights groups such as Palestine Legal that he had given special [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=77.04s)]
*  priority to a complaint filed by the Zionist Organization of America against Rutgers University, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=82.4s)]
*  pushing it to the top of his pile over more than 400 open appeals. A group called Berkeley Unified [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=88.80000000000001s)]
*  School District Jewish Parents for Collective Liberation released a statement condemning the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=96.16000000000001s)]
*  complaints and urged school district officials to protect its students and educators. The [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=100.80000000000001s)]
*  parents write, quote, We reject the false conflation between anti-Semitism and criticism [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=106.72s)]
*  of the state of Israel and its military assault on Palestinians. Jewish safety and Palestinian [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=111.76s)]
*  freedom are intertwined. The danger of anti-Semitism comes from white nationalism, not from those who [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=117.44s)]
*  support Palestinian human rights and freedom. Joining us to talk about all of this are two [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=123.2s)]
*  guests, Christina Harb and Liz Jackson. Christina is a Palestinian American middle school teacher. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=129.04s)]
*  In her spare time, she performs traditional Palestinian debke and volunteers with Palestinian [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=134.72s)]
*  youth. And our viewers and listeners should already be familiar with Liz Jackson. She's a [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=140.32s)]
*  former and founding staff attorney with Palestine Legal. Liz is a Jewish solidarity activist and a [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=145.2s)]
*  parent of two Berkeley kids. Christina and Liz, thank you so much for being with us on the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=151.84s)]
*  Electronic Intifada podcast. Thank you for having us. Yeah, thanks. So sorry for that long-winded [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=156.32s)]
*  background on Kenneth Marcus, the head of the Brandeis Center, one of the most thuggish [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=163.84s)]
*  lawfare groups in the US. But I wanted to start by talking about this federal complaint. Marcus's [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=168.88s)]
*  group and the ADL, the Anti-Defamation League, are claiming that there's a pervasive atmosphere [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=174.16s)]
*  of anti-Jewish bigotry on Berkeley school campuses. What's actually going on here? Christina, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=180.08s)]
*  do you want to start as an educator? Yeah, I'm happy to start. So since early October, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=186.24s)]
*  teachers have been attempting to teach their students about what's happening in Gaza, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=194.08s)]
*  which also requires teaching the history of Palestine. And teachers and students have [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=198.64000000000001s)]
*  been expressing solidarity and support for the people of Gaza and for the people of Palestine. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=203.76000000000002s)]
*  As that support has been expressed and as lessons have been taught in classrooms, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=209.44s)]
*  a small group of parents have started filing formal complaints against the teachers. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=215.36s)]
*  The complaints are accusing the teachers of creating an atmosphere of anti-Semitism. But when [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=220.96s)]
*  you look more closely at the complaints, not that I've seen them, but teachers have expressed what's [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=226.96s)]
*  going on to me and have confided in me, the complaints are generally about things that are [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=232.16s)]
*  about Palestine. So for example, teachers wearing free Palestine buttons were accused of wearing [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=238.08s)]
*  Jewish hate buttons. A teacher who was expressing solidarity by putting a big Palestinian flag [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=243.76s)]
*  in her window was also accused of creating an anti-Semitic atmosphere. And her school [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=251.2s)]
*  information was released by a parent in the district to a national network. And so the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=257.92s)]
*  elementary school ended up getting thousands of phone calls, many threats, and a drone appeared [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=263.76s)]
*  over the school. And the threats were something along the lines of you have one hour to take the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=269.92s)]
*  flag down or else. So what we're seeing is really just like a lot of attacks on Palestinian solidarity, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=275.28000000000003s)]
*  teachers who have used the word apartheid or the word colonization in class, and making pretty fair [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=283.04s)]
*  comparisons to American colonies or apartheid South Africa, which is something that's not new [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=288.08000000000004s)]
*  that they've done in their classrooms for years, actually. Those lessons were also complained about [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=294.08000000000004s)]
*  formally. And so essentially this attempt to teach about Palestine or express support in a school [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=299.84s)]
*  district that historically is very political and supports political expression has essentially been [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=308.88s)]
*  anti-Palestinian attacks. And Liz, what are some of the examples that the Brandeis Center and the ADL [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=314.88s)]
*  have put in their complaint to the Department of Education? Yeah, so the complaint really is a long [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=323.36s)]
*  string of misrepresentations is a nice way of putting it, but a series of false assertions or [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=333.52000000000004s)]
*  lies would be the lame person's term, mixed with some exaggerations and some incidences of [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=341.36s)]
*  of true anti-Semitism kind of all strung together to paint a completely false picture based on [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=349.68s)]
*  fear and based on a premise of assuming that all speech supportive of Palestinians' right to live [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=357.44s)]
*  amidst genocide is somehow targeting Jewish students. So some examples, we saw a whole section [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=364.79999999999995s)]
*  focused on a high school teacher who prompted her students to answer the question as to whether or [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=374.24s)]
*  not Israel is an apartheid state. Now what was not in the complaint is that this high school teacher [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=382.08000000000004s)]
*  was teaching a whole unit as she does every year on South African apartheid. And when you are [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=386.8s)]
*  teaching a rigorous course on global history like this teacher is, that requires some comparing and [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=393.20000000000005s)]
*  contrasting. So of course that's a completely appropriate contextualized multi-perspective [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=398.4s)]
*  critical thinking lesson for kids who are in high school, who are about to become voters and global [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=406.0s)]
*  citizens and people who influence U.S. foreign policy to understand the impacts of what an [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=414.56s)]
*  apartheid state looks like and how to describe it. And as we're watching the genocide unfold [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=421.52s)]
*  on their phones for these students to think critically about the context of that. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=427.28s)]
*  So the complaint of course completely erased that context and that's an example of [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=432.08s)]
*  a false representation. Another is an example of a teacher who was interacting with a wall against [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=438.08s)]
*  hate that they've had in their school since 2016, I think it was, is that right Christina? 2017, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=445.12s)]
*  in the same location a bulletin board of Post-it notes where students write love messages to [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=451.36s)]
*  combat hate and the different ways that they understand that and what the teacher did also [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=456.56s)]
*  perfectly age appropriate for her elementary school classroom was have the kids write their ideas [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=461.92s)]
*  about how to combat hate and interact with this wall. And because of the context one of the [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=466.4s)]
*  students wrote, the students idea was stop bombing babies. Now you know, I mean that one would have [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=472.48s)]
*  to say stop bombing babies, that that would even be considered a controversial statement [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=481.68s)]
*  that an elementary school student would know that babies are being bombed is in itself completely [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=486.0s)]
*  tragic but unfortunately a really uncomfortable reality that our children are aware of and need [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=491.76s)]
*  to process and interact with. So one of her students wrote stop bombing babies and then this [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=497.2s)]
*  was portrayed in the Brandeis Center fake news complaint as an anti-semitic attack on a teacher [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=502.72s)]
*  and they lied and said that the teacher that these Post-it notes were targeting the Jewish students [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=510.32s)]
*  the Jewish teacher which is completely false it was in the bulletin board the same place the [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=516.0s)]
*  bulletin board has been for years and it was a message that I think we can all really easily [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=521.44s)]
*  agree with that babies should not be bombed. So the complaint it's you know really just [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=527.04s)]
*  it's a legal complaint it's a letter to a federal agency but it's really more than a legal complaint [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=534.72s)]
*  it's a fake news strategy to whip up a media storm based on fear in order to pressure the [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=541.52s)]
*  district by scaring enough parents who think that their children cannot be you know cannot be [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=551.04s)]
*  confronted with the discomfort of the reality of Israel's brutal military assault and you know the [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=558.96s)]
*  this murderous regime that we're witnessing on our phones is is uncomfortable and that can be [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=566.32s)]
*  hard for some students to have to confront in the classroom but that is not the same as being made [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=571.7600000000001s)]
*  unsafe or discrimination. So yeah this is a classic ADL Brandeis Center move to use fake news to whip [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=576.8000000000001s)]
*  up fear which is really a strategy just to justify censorship. And can you talk about some of the [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=585.0400000000001s)]
*  rhetoric and attacks on educators and students by some of the Berkeley parents as well? Christina [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=593.6s)]
*  you're a Palestinian teacher at a middle school in Berkeley. What kind of smear campaigns have [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=603.9200000000001s)]
*  been levied against you and your colleagues? So as a Palestinian teacher in Berkeley I have not had [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=613.2s)]
*  any formal complaints filed against me. I think that would be a little too obvious in anti-Palestinian [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=618.88s)]
*  racism to come after me. However what I have experienced is after speaking at a board meeting [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=625.4399999999999s)]
*  I did receive an email from a parent who wanted to talk to me. He did not introduce himself to me [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=633.52s)]
*  who he is. I had no idea who he was and later found out you know he was a parent attempted to [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=638.72s)]
*  communicate with him and talk to him at a non-school event outside of school hours, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=644.48s)]
*  outside of contract hours and try to reach across the aisle a little bit. And that conversation [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=649.6s)]
*  really got warped and I received another email saying that I threatened this parent and saying [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=657.2s)]
*  that I said in a threatening way we know where you live which is not what happened. What really [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=664.72s)]
*  happened is the teacher who was targeted for having a Palestinian flag in her classroom [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=670.24s)]
*  and I were both at the event and we just kind of confronted him like hey you know we're aware that [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=676.0s)]
*  your partner released this teacher's information online and you keep asking us for conversations [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=682.96s)]
*  and we just want to make it really clear that we're not comfortable having conversations with you. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=688.96s)]
*  This is not feeling like a safe, we're not safe having conversations with you given the kind of [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=693.6s)]
*  behavior that we saw. So that was twisted later into you know you said that we know where you [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=699.04s)]
*  live and I feel threatened and I responded to the email to let him know that's not what happened. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=706.4s)]
*  The other teacher did not respond and so this parent took it upon himself to say okay this is [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=711.4399999999999s)]
*  confirmation that you did threaten me. And so another teacher, an art teacher actually at Berkeley [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=716.8s)]
*  who was put on leave just a few days after the complaint was released had his personal [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=722.72s)]
*  information also put online. His first and last name, screenshots from his social media and the [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=729.5200000000001s)]
*  same day that that happened he was put on leave. So there are other teachers who have just been [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=735.2s)]
*  experiencing a lot of email harassment and feeling very attacked and so when these [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=741.44s)]
*  parents have been filing these complaints the district has been responding and so when the [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=749.52s)]
*  ADL complaint says the district is ignoring it that's totally not true because the teachers that [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=754.24s)]
*  I know have many many of them have been pulled into like individual interviews with administrators, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=759.68s)]
*  they've been pulled into meetings, questioned, you know investigated, interrogated about you know [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=765.12s)]
*  what did you mean when you said this in the lesson and why did you use this book and why did you use [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=770.3199999999999s)]
*  this lesson and what was the intention and a lot of scrutiny, a lot of questioning. So the district [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=774.48s)]
*  has been investigating the claims of anti-Semitism. It's completely untrue that they're doing nothing [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=780.5600000000001s)]
*  about it but the teacher is receiving this kind of this kind of scrutiny in a district where [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=784.96s)]
*  they've never really experienced this before. Many of them have been here for 20-30 years and [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=791.6800000000001s)]
*  they've all told me this is the first time in Berkeley which is a very progressive radical [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=796.32s)]
*  school district voluntarily desegregated in 1968. Very well known for student organizing. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=801.36s)]
*  They've said you know we have never we've never experienced anything like this before. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=809.84s)]
*  We many many of the teachers even have you know somewhat political posters in their classrooms [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=814.4s)]
*  that would be considered controversial in a place like Florida right. Black Lives Matter posters, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=819.6800000000001s)]
*  pride flags, posters supporting undocumented immigrants right. These are things that are [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=824.72s)]
*  considered controversial in many other parts of the country but not in Berkeley and so this is [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=829.92s)]
*  really the first time that people are kind of dealing with this idea of like wow this is [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=834.88s)]
*  controversial and we're getting actually way more pushback than we've ever experienced before. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=838.64s)]
*  I mean Liz it just reminds me of all the years that I've been reporting on cases that Palestine [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=845.4399999999999s)]
*  Legal has been involved in where you know an Israel lobby group or you know some some Israel [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=852.3199999999999s)]
*  aligned group on campus you know accuses the the Palestinian student you know students or [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=859.12s)]
*  students for justice in Palestine or the Muslim student associations of you know virulent anti-Semitism [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=868.08s)]
*  and then instead of protecting the students or the educators the members of faculty the administration [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=875.76s)]
*  just you know goes on the war path and starts punishing educators or putting students on [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=882.64s)]
*  educational probation or you know what how do you see this pattern acting out in the Berkeley Unified [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=891.1999999999999s)]
*  School District? Yeah I have been having the same recurring thought as I watched this play out of [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=899.68s)]
*  wow we've seen this over and over again this is the anatomy of a smear pressure campaign with all [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=909.36s)]
*  of the classic elements you know a legal tool that is actually a vehicle for media smear campaign [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=916.88s)]
*  to justify otherwise completely unjustifiable censorship on education. So yeah first the [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=925.28s)]
*  allegations that have very little basis in reality exaggerating shreds of truth combined with a few [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=932.64s)]
*  instances of of course concerning anti-Semitism because we have that in our society and we need [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=940.16s)]
*  education not censorship. Yeah so this creates a media storm which creates the pressure which then [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=945.12s)]
*  puts administrators you know who feel like they have their backs to the wall in a you know in a [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=953.2s)]
*  situation where they feel then pressured to enact censorship on their educators. It's just a formula [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=959.12s)]
*  and we see it over and over again and you know something that is so apparent to me now as a [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=966.08s)]
*  parent watching these young people is how deeply racist and anti-Palestinian this is and how much [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=975.2s)]
*  it hurts all young people of color because in Berkeley we have this commitment to educating [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=983.04s)]
*  about Palestine not as a single issue but in context of Arab American history understanding [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=989.1999999999999s)]
*  how colonization works how we came to live in Berkeley California on a lonely land you know in [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=996.64s)]
*  a context of a white supremacist state you know our children are learning about these issues [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1002.56s)]
*  in deep context with other racial justice issues so that they can understand their own experience [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1008.64s)]
*  so that we can better educate you know have curriculum that is relevant and meaningful to [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1016.4s)]
*  the lives of young people of color who are facing all kinds of economic pressures and gentrification [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1022.1600000000001s)]
*  in our city etc. So this attack on teaching Palestine and the attack on our educators who [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1029.76s)]
*  are most committed to this curriculum in context that's really about these Black and Brown kids [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1035.04s)]
*  in our community it just is such a attack on these children and their right to get an equal education [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1041.68s)]
*  and you just can I can really see that close up now as a parent in a way that is was harder for [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1050.56s)]
*  me to see as a lawyer helping university students even though we've been saying for years trying to [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1055.84s)]
*  point out the deep anti-Palestinian racism that is at play here and just the extreme [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1062.48s)]
*  gaslighting to tell vulnerable people you know refugees immigrants and Black allies that you are [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1070.64s)]
*  your calls for justice you know your cries to learn about inequality you're begging to have some [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1081.28s)]
*  space to learn about and protest an unspeakable genocide that we can't even believe is happening [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1088.4s)]
*  before our eyes being told that that is harming other students is so the silencing there is just [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1094.72s)]
*  so deeply racist and you know we've known that we've seen that over and over again on many [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1103.6000000000001s)]
*  campuses but I will say I can see it up close now targeting our young people and you know just to [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1107.6000000000001s)]
*  have to watch a video clip of a young Muslim student of Berkeley High who's there so brave [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1113.28s)]
*  to speak be told no you can't speak here and watch that in on his face is it's just especially [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1120.32s)]
*  apparent for a young person young you know and and the university students I think you know get a [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1128.8799999999999s)]
*  little tougher everyone's vulnerable but you can just really see the pain of that racism when it's [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1134.8s)]
*  focused on children yeah and what has the district I mean the district is is trying to [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1139.68s)]
*  silence and intimidate the educators what have the school district meetings looked like so far [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1149.6000000000001s)]
*  so I have not been in any meetings but the the people who have been in meetings have said it's [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1159.52s)]
*  just a lot of scrutiny and a lot of questioning around intentions around bias around perspectives [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1165.76s)]
*  around how the lessons fit into the curriculum which you know as a teacher I know that teachers [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1171.2s)]
*  have a responsibility to teach to current events and we have a responsibility to hold space for [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1177.12s)]
*  our students as things are unfolding around us this is not new for teachers and yet teachers [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1181.52s)]
*  have been told you know stick to the curriculum and just a lot of questioning and I think that [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1187.6s)]
*  that kind of pressure is a lot for some folks right so some some folks have been really strong [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1192.96s)]
*  and said no this is okay I'm teaching this there's a good reason behind it and others have have not [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1198.0s)]
*  talked about it even once in their classroom and and I wouldn't say I don't know that the district [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1203.8400000000001s)]
*  is intentionally trying to silence it the district did approve a vetted curriculum of three or four [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1209.2s)]
*  lessons about Palestine and Israel that they pushed out to Ethnic Studies teachers we have [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1215.68s)]
*  a controversial teaching board policy that protects the teaching of controversial issues [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1221.92s)]
*  in the school district so I think that there there are some protections within the district [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1227.92s)]
*  but I think that the way that the the district administration has gone about this questioning [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1234.0800000000002s)]
*  and this interviewing especially when the interviews are done one-on-one they're a little [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1241.1200000000001s)]
*  ominous the questions are not given ahead of time early in this the interviews were done without [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1245.1200000000001s)]
*  having union representation and now they are saying okay yes you can have union representation [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1251.6s)]
*  because we pushed back because our union pushed back I also do want to say that you know outside [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1256.24s)]
*  of just interviewing teachers there have been other attempts to kind of remove symbolism of [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1262.32s)]
*  support for Palestine so we have so you can see my t-shirt it says teach Palestine we also have [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1268.8799999999999s)]
*  these posters that we've been putting up around the school and early on administrators were asked [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1273.84s)]
*  teachers to take the teach Palestine posters down because they were one-sided and made people [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1280.3999999999999s)]
*  uncomfortable and they needed to show both sides and so that happened and again our union did step [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1285.6799999999998s)]
*  in to say no we have the right to have these posters up just like any other poster that [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1291.4399999999998s)]
*  teachers have up there was a demonstration at Berkeley High where teachers and students got [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1295.1999999999998s)]
*  together and made these beautiful posters that said my hopes and dreams for Israel and Palestine [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1302.48s)]
*  are and they said these beautiful things like peace and love and the end to killing and the end [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1306.56s)]
*  to the occupation they went up on a Friday afternoon and administrators took them down by [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1311.28s)]
*  Monday morning and for the reason of saying you know we don't know which ones were student-made [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1316.8799999999999s)]
*  or teacher-made and so that was the the argument there but the students I can't imagine how that [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1322.56s)]
*  must have for them to put so much heart and soul into such a beautiful message and then see them [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1328.32s)]
*  taken off of the walls so yeah and we unfortunately you know don't have that much control over what [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1332.88s)]
*  happens off of campus right so we have had several student walkouts happen high school students [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1340.96s)]
*  walked out twice the middle school students walked out once and the administrator's you know role [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1347.0400000000002s)]
*  really is to just they can't tell the students not to protest that's their right to protest and so [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1353.1200000000001s)]
*  what their role is is to ensure the students are safe and get back to campus safely right [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1358.0s)]
*  and so at these protests our administrators you know were there observing supervising [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1364.4s)]
*  district people were there and there was a there were parents there who were oppositional to our [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1369.76s)]
*  students doing this walkout when they found out the walkout was going to happen a few days before [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1376.24s)]
*  our office was totally inundated with phone calls parents coming in to meet with the principal [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1381.92s)]
*  demanding that the protest does not happen because it's anti-Jewish and anti-semitic [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1386.96s)]
*  and so the students still did the protest they walked out their chants were free Palestine from [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1391.44s)]
*  the river to the sea you know and ceasefire now right which all of those have been accused of being [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1398.24s)]
*  anti-semitic phrases by local pro-Israel organizations and parents who were oppositional [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1403.8400000000001s)]
*  to the protest actually organized themselves to come to the students protest many of them were [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1410.16s)]
*  not even parents at the schools and followed the students and recorded them looking for evidence [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1414.88s)]
*  of anti-semitism looking for evidence of teachers supporting the walkout and later in the ADL [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1420.16s)]
*  complaint you'll see that it says that our students were chanting anti-semitic phrases [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1426.0800000000002s)]
*  and there were at least 12 to 15 parents at each event that didn't hear any of that so [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1430.88s)]
*  incredible well this the students are having walkouts how are parents organizing against [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1436.96s)]
*  these smear campaigns and against the legal complaint [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1443.4399999999998s)]
*  Liz as a parent [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1448.6399999999999s)]
*  yeah I guess as a parent we just we know from years of experience that our teachers are [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1451.9199999999998s)]
*  trusted you know they're they're kind they're brave they're professionals who know how to [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1457.84s)]
*  facilitate difficult conversations and I know my own kids have been in plenty of those [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1463.76s)]
*  you know across multiple classrooms so one we're you know doing the best we can to affirm [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1471.6s)]
*  for the public that we trust our teachers who are you know professional educators and it is their [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1478.72s)]
*  job to teach not ours to nitpick and you know and complain from afar and I think that's [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1486.4s)]
*  as Jewish parents we're doing our best to put forward the message that yes it is uncomfortable [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1493.68s)]
*  to learn about Israel's genocidal acts and and discomfort for a Jewish youth is very different [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1498.48s)]
*  than unsafe and and we it's very difficult to watch some a small handful of you know extremist [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1506.88s)]
*  right-wing Jewish parents stand up and tell the community and tell their own children that they're [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1518.56s)]
*  everyone hates them because they're Jewish when what we see is yes some incredibly justifiable [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1525.12s)]
*  rage at the state of Israel and then here and there are some some real misunderstandings among [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1531.76s)]
*  our youth about who is responsible for Israel's crime Israel's crimes and the difference between [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1537.44s)]
*  Israeli supporter and Jewish there's some misunderstanding about that among our children [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1543.76s)]
*  and again just really organizing with the message that we need education not censorship [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1547.68s)]
*  so it's not acceptable that a small handful of parents are willing to jeopardize the entire [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1554.24s)]
*  ethnic studies program including Palestine just to censor and prevent a small handful of students [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1560.48s)]
*  from being made uncomfortable in the classroom so we're organizing we're speaking in the media [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1566.72s)]
*  we're meeting each other I've met so many new Jewish parents who I had not met before [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1571.44s)]
*  who you know who feel the same as me and I'm meeting new people on my children's sports teams [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1578.0s)]
*  who say oh hey Liz I saw you out there and at the board meeting we're on the same [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1584.3200000000002s)]
*  threat you know messaging thread you know we're finding each other and we're pushing back and [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1591.04s)]
*  making sure the district has its support to know that the parents are here to support their teachers [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1595.44s)]
*  and we trust our teachers and it just reminds me the the the ongoing attacks against the ethnic [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1599.6s)]
*  studies curricula in California specifically I mean this just ties in with that you know the [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1609.28s)]
*  same groups that are against the ethnic studies program Brandeis Center the ADL a whole slew of [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1615.9199999999998s)]
*  other anti-Palestinian organizations have been working for years I think almost a decade trying [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1622.9599999999998s)]
*  to dismantle the ethnic studies program in the state like how how does you know Berkeley it's [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1628.16s)]
*  it's you know it's a it's a small city but it's very significant in terms of you know the the [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1636.3200000000002s)]
*  symbolic nature of like if the Zionist organizations can threaten the Berkeley Unified School District [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1644.96s)]
*  like you know it it would you know set a precedent for them to go after other school [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1652.72s)]
*  districts I mean we've seen that happen Christina what are you you know what are you concerned [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1658.56s)]
*  about with with this complaint and and what keeps you hopeful right now as a teacher and an organizer [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1664.88s)]
*  Thank you for that question so I think a major concern of the complaint or two major concerns is [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1672.56s)]
*  one the chilling impact that it had on everyone who doesn't act many people don't know the the true [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1680.8s)]
*  stories behind the complaints right they don't they don't know they just see the complaint [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1688.1599999999999s)]
*  they're maybe not plugged in and so my biggest concern is that the complaint has had a chilling [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1692.0s)]
*  effect and one of the things that Liz mentioned which is that the parents are truly organizing [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1696.56s)]
*  to get the message out to to talk to media and to be at board meetings and to really [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1702.32s)]
*  um make things really clear to the community what's really happening so um that's that's [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1707.3600000000001s)]
*  one thing but the other concern is that the complaint at the very bottom suggested a remedy [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1713.44s)]
*  and the remedy is for the school district to adopt the IRA definition of anti-Semitism [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1719.44s)]
*  that's I think it's the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance yep so the International [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1725.2s)]
*  Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition which says that you can't say that the Israeli state [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1732.96s)]
*  is a racist endeavor which means you can't call it an apartheid state you can't talk about colonization [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1741.04s)]
*  which effectively would completely censor and erase Palestinian history and narratives from [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1747.28s)]
*  the school district and so I think that the Department of Education as a whole has really [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1753.52s)]
*  resisted adopting that definition I know it's a definition that's been you know um adopted by the [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1759.2s)]
*  U.S. government through a non-binding resolution but the Department of Education I think is a [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1765.8400000000001s)]
*  little more savvy to know that this this would attend this would erase Palestinian narratives [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1771.1200000000001s)]
*  from the school districts and so I am a little concerned that that is the remedy that they're [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1776.0s)]
*  asking for and so we have been you know organizing to make sure that our district leaders are really [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1780.88s)]
*  educated about the history of censorship of Palestinian narratives and to make sure that [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1786.56s)]
*  they understand the nature of this complaint to make sure they understand the nature of the ADL [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1791.9199999999998s)]
*  the Brandeis Center also the Deborah Project which has also been coming after Oakland Unified School [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1796.1599999999999s)]
*  District um we want to make sure they have a clear understanding so a lot of what we're doing is [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1801.12s)]
*  actually political education um and then communicating more broadly to the community um because yeah if [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1806.0s)]
*  Berkeley were to adopt it I I am afraid of what that would do to the rest of the the schools in [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1813.04s)]
*  the country um and what's giving me hope as an organizer I want to echo something that Liz said [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1819.44s)]
*  which is um despite six months of uh just daily trauma and um you know grieving and rage and [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1824.96s)]
*  every emotion I think I can think of I've experienced in the last six months um as a [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1835.1200000000001s)]
*  Palestinian who you know who arrived in Berkeley only a year and a half ago I when I first got to [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1840.4s)]
*  Berkeley I I saw a giant Palestinian flag on someone's house and thought oh my god this [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1847.1200000000001s)]
*  this place is great like there's this is because this place got to be very pro-Palestinian this is [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1852.64s)]
*  amazing um when I celebrated my culture with the school at an Arab American Heritage Month [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1857.3600000000001s)]
*  Assembly everyone was so ecstatic and excited and interested to learn more about Palestinian culture [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1862.0800000000002s)]
*  and so the shift you know into this this atmosphere where I keep hearing all these stories [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1867.5200000000002s)]
*  about oh I was told to take my poster down I was told I can't wear this button or whatever it was [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1874.88s)]
*  just even though it wasn't directed at me it felt very much like oh my god this atmosphere doesn't [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1880.0s)]
*  feel safe for me or this environment doesn't feel safe for me um however what has given me hope is [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1884.0800000000002s)]
*  um I I have discovered and found a really beautiful community of teachers and parents and [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1889.8400000000001s)]
*  other organizers in Berkeley who have just uh come out of the woodworks to me I just I I don't even [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1897.2s)]
*  I've met these people just a few months ago and I would trust them with my life honestly um and we [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1903.44s)]
*  have been doing uh some really amazing work together and many of the board meetings have been really [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1908.0800000000002s)]
*  uplifting to be at especially when we hear student voices I think the student organizing that I've [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1912.8000000000002s)]
*  seen is really giving me so much hope the high school students plan several demonstrations and [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1918.0800000000002s)]
*  even the middle school students um and seeing the way that parents have really stepped up to [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1923.44s)]
*  the plate to defend the school to defend the students um it's something I just didn't expect [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1928.0s)]
*  I mean the this is the one bright spot of everything that's happened in the last six months [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1933.76s)]
*  is like really finding this beautiful community of really powerful loving radical you know parents [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1938.64s)]
*  and teachers and students and organizers who have provided a space for me to feel really held and [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1945.04s)]
*  and have also you know provided space to to um push things that matter right now in the school [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1952.16s)]
*  district and um to make sure that our school district is protected from these kinds of political [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1959.44s)]
*  attacks thanks for that uh Liz from a legal perspective what are the ways that parents [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1964.4s)]
*  and educators can and should uh protect free speech on Palestine what are the first steps [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1973.04s)]
*  um okay so number one people in our community who are Palestinian Arab Muslim or allied [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1982.0s)]
*  or you know with with these communities are perceived to be um are often um pretty tough [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1991.04s)]
*  from experiencing years of alienation and discrimination and you know a lot of [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=1998.3200000000002s)]
*  um people who have their own personal circumstances have fled um incredibly violent situations and are [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=2005.28s)]
*  um you know are not here to um complain or victimize themselves and and it's the it's a hard [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=2012.32s)]
*  thing about that is we're really we're really asking everyone in the community to share with [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=2021.76s)]
*  us what your experiences of discrimination are and share those experiences with your school [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=2026.56s)]
*  districts because they need to know and they don't automatically ask or understand what it [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=2032.48s)]
*  really means to be from a community that has directly experienced violence and displacement [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=2039.76s)]
*  and is now part of our school communities and not really ready to raise your hands and complain [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=2045.84s)]
*  about every little thing but the microaggressions and the severe instances of discrimination are [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=2049.52s)]
*  happening on a daily basis and people need to come forward and share that with someone trusted like [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=2056.08s)]
*  a community organization um and or you know our trusted teachers and and make those complaints [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=2061.44s)]
*  to your school districts that's one two um teachers really need to assert their rights [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=2067.76s)]
*  as public citizens to speak openly you know i've been asked by teachers am i allowed to call for a [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=2075.28s)]
*  ceasefire and it's like that just that right there just illustrates what a chilling repressive [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=2081.6s)]
*  mccarthyist environment we have in you know in this war that that we are enacting it's [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=2088.4s)]
*  it's um has you know really obvious historical echoes of repression in the vietnam era and you [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=2095.1200000000003s)]
*  know other world war ii etc like the u.s backed bombardment and now starvation of gaza is reaching [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=2101.28s)]
*  unfathomable proportions and so is the war of repression here at home where teachers don't know [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=2108.0800000000004s)]
*  if they're allowed to publicly call for a ceasefire so yes teachers absolutely have the right [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=2114.16s)]
*  to speak publicly as citizens and oppose genocide and call for a ceasefire but teachers really need [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=2120.0s)]
*  support in asserting those rights because the reality is that yes teachers who call for ceasefire [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=2127.12s)]
*  are being harassed and targeted and doxxed so um so the first step is complaining about instances [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=2132.08s)]
*  of discrimination the second step is really asserting the free speech rights that teachers [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=2139.3599999999997s)]
*  do have and the third is for teachers to and parents to seek support in having real education [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=2142.88s)]
*  and contextualized conversations about difficult issues like genocide in our classrooms so we do [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=2148.08s)]
*  expect our teachers to teach about that but yes teachers need support to teach about it in a way [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=2153.6800000000003s)]
*  that's contextualized um you know and sensitive and understanding the students in the room are [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=2158.56s)]
*  not unsafe but are are uncomfortable and are and are you know supporting our students through that [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=2164.88s)]
*  discomfort um and yeah other legal um issues are filing legal complaints where we do see [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=2169.52s)]
*  hostile environments and discrimination um against Palestinians and Palestinian allies [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=2176.16s)]
*  and really demanding that our unions protect teachers rights and demanding that our schools [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=2182.4s)]
*  do not bow to this these legal bullying tools and meet their responsibilities as educators [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=2189.6s)]
*  to teach our kids about the realities [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=2196.16s)]
*  well finally what's uh what's the next step in this uh process to to challenge uh this legal [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=2200.3999999999996s)]
*  complaint to the part to the department of education um and and what can people do who are [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=2208.56s)]
*  both inside and outside of Berkeley to help [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=2214.56s)]
*  us to make this a real public step [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=2218.16s)]
*  so the first step is um because this is really a media attack is to make it really clear to the [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=2225.2s)]
*  public what the truth is of you know Berkeley schools yeah we are a town um that desegregated [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNigu5bRqlM&t=2229.84s)]
