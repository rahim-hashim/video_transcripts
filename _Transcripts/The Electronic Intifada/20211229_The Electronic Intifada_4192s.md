Video Description: On episode 48 of The Electronic Intifada Podcast, Asa and Nora are joined by colleagues Maureen Clare Murphy and Tamara Nassar for a roundtable discussion on some of our top stories of 2021.
As more human rights abuses inside Israel‚Äôs cyberwarfare industry were exposed, we talk about the technology itself and the Israeli military‚Äôs use of spyware that has been long field-tested on Palestinians.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not really about who this surveillance technology is being sold to,‚Äù says Tamara, ‚Äúbut whether such a technology should be able to exist in the first place.‚Äù
‚ÄúIsrael has always done this [surveillance], but it has greater tools to do this now,‚Äù Maureen adds.
We also reflect on our reporting during Israel‚Äôs May attacks on Gaza.
During the 11-day escalation, at least 260 Palestinians in Gaza were killed in Israeli strikes, including 66 children.
Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, inside Israel and at the boundaries with Lebanon and Syria, participated in unified resistance against Israeli colonialism and violence.
And Hamas‚Äô armed wing displayed key advances in its resistance strategies.
Israel ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt know how to respond to this kind of national unity and power [of] the resistance, despite them not having the kind of military technology that Israel has,‚Äù Tamara says.
‚ÄúAnd so it did things like bomb the Associated Press building, and the Al Jazeera building; it obliterated entire families in their homes, because that‚Äôs the only language it knows how to speak.‚Äù
Maureen explains that‚Äôs why ‚Äúit‚Äôs up to people on the outside to organize more effectively, so that there is a cost on Israel ‚Äì and to help change, as much as we can, that power equation. So [that] Israel can‚Äôt keep getting away with this like it does after each assault on Gaza."

*  And welcome back to the electronic intifada podcast. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=40.96s)]
*  I'm Nora Barrows-Freedman with Asa Wyn Stanley. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=43.32s)]
*  It's the end of the year and we have a very special episode today. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, we're excited to be joined by our two colleagues, Maureen Murphy and Tamara Nasr [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=49.32s)]
*  to talk about some of the most important stories of 2021 from inside Palestine and from around the world. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=55.64s)]
*  So, yeah, that's what we're going to talk about. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=62.64s)]
*  It's a wrap up of the year episode and it's great to have you both on. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=65.64s)]
*  Yeah. Thanks for coming on, guys. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=70.64s)]
*  Good to be with you both and Tamara too. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=73.64s)]
*  So we're going to cover a lot of ground today, but I wanted to start by having Tamara talk about her new story. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=78.64s)]
*  Israel's cyber warfare industry had a bad year. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=84.64s)]
*  You write, quote, As more news of its role in human rights abuses surfaces, the company has been hammered with lawsuits from tech giants and US government sanctions. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=87.64s)]
*  It may even be on the verge of collapse, but that does not mean Israel's state-sponsored cyber warfare and espionage industry would disappear with it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=97.64s)]
*  And it's such an important story, I think, and encapsulates a lot of what's been happening in 2021. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=107.64s)]
*  Tamara, for our listeners who may not have heard about the NSO group and Israel's surveillance apparatus. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=114.64s)]
*  Can you tell us what it is and the significance of this technology being, as you say, hammered with lawsuits and sanctions, especially by the US, one of Israel's greatest supporters? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=121.64s)]
*  Right. Of course. So NSO group is an Israeli cyber war, cyberware firm that started in 2010. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=132.64s)]
*  And it was founded by three members of something called Unit 8200. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=143.64s)]
*  Unit 8200 is a high tech surveillance branch of the Israeli military. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=151.64s)]
*  It's comparable to the NSA. It's like the Israeli version of the American NSA. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=157.64s)]
*  And this branch of the Israeli military kind of specializes in spying on Palestinians in order to blackmail them. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=164.64s)]
*  And there is this pipeline from Unit 8200 to Israel's surveillance industry. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=173.64s)]
*  A lot of its veterans go on to establish spy firms, private companies that sell this kind of malware. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=182.64s)]
*  So NSO group really started making headlines not really this year, but as early as 2016. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=193.64s)]
*  It is best known for its signature cyber malware called Pegasus. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=200.64s)]
*  And Pegasus is really like one of the most sophisticated malwares known in the industry, at least from what we know. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=208.64s)]
*  It allows those doing this spying to covertly install very sophisticated malware on the device of the targeted user. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=218.64s)]
*  And once that malware is successfully installed, and of course this can happen on iPhones, on Androids, and other devices, but mostly mobile phones, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=229.64s)]
*  it allows those doing this spying to extract a terrifying amount of data. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=240.64s)]
*  This includes pictures, text messages, emails, passwords, you name it. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=245.64s)]
*  It allows those doing the spying to control the device remotely. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=252.64s)]
*  It becomes a weapon against its own user, doesn't it? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=258.64s)]
*  Because they remotely control it, turn on the microphone, turn on the camera. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=262.64s)]
*  Your own phone becomes a spying device against you. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=267.64s)]
*  100% and you're constantly feeding its information because it's supposedly one of the most... you said it best. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=271.64s)]
*  Earlier versions of Pegasus were a bit different. They operated a bit differently. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=278.64s)]
*  So when it was discovered, or when expert analysts first discovered Pegasus back in 2016, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=285.64s)]
*  those who were trying to install Pegasus on a targeted device would require the targeted user to kind of interact with a certain bait that they would send. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=294.64s)]
*  So for example, they would have to send the malware in the shape of a text containing a link. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=306.64s)]
*  And they would design the text in a way that the targeted person would be lured enough to click on the link. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=313.64s)]
*  And once they click on the link, they would hope that the malware successfully installs on the phone and then it becomes compromised. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=319.64s)]
*  Later versions of Pegasus did leave a trace, for example, in the form of a missed call on Skype or WhatsApp, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=326.64s)]
*  but did not require the user to interact with a link or a text. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=335.64s)]
*  And now some of the latest versions of Pegasus do not require the targeted user to interact with the malware at all. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=340.64s)]
*  And it leaves absolutely no trace. It's called a zero click, zero day target. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=347.64s)]
*  And what that means is that, you know, you would not notice really a significant change on your phone. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=354.64s)]
*  The malware would be installed quickly and quietly on your phone without it being immediately knowable that your phone was targeted. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=364.64s)]
*  And one interesting detail that I haven't seen reported a lot about Pegasus is that it also has the power to self destruct on command. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=375.64s)]
*  So basically, if those doing this pying become aware that the targeted user is somehow, you know, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=385.64s)]
*  starting to become aware that their phone is infected, they can program Pegasus to destroy itself and therefore destroy all the evidence that it was on this targeted device. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=395.64s)]
*  And it would make it even more difficult for expert analysts to to find traces of Pegasus on the phone. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=405.64s)]
*  So one of the earliest cases of Pegasus really infecting a phone, at least earliest known cases or targeting a phone, not sure if it was infected actually, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=413.64s)]
*  was the targeting of this Emirati based opponent, human rights defender. His name is Ahmed Mansour. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=428.64s)]
*  He was sent a text basically saying there's, you know, there's new secrets about UAE torturing prisoners. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=439.64s)]
*  And like he forwarded the text to Citizen Lab, which is a research lab in Canada that has done good work and released some really good reports about NSO group technology. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=447.64s)]
*  Yeah. And and over the years, you know, these kinds of reports have been piling up [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=463.64s)]
*  all kinds of lawsuits and reports accusing NSO group of target NSO groups technology of targeting journalists and human rights defenders and politicians and lawmakers have, you know, all all sorts of people being targeted by NSO group technology. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=470.64s)]
*  And one of the one of the high profile cases that was reported on was the link between Pegasus and the killing of the Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October 2018 in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=489.64s)]
*  And it was revealed that the phone, the phone belonging to his one of his really close friends activist Omar Abdul Aziz, who is a Saudi activist living in Canada and also the phone of his fiance being infected by NSO group. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=509.64s)]
*  And this this this was starting, you know, to stir the pot for NSO group. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=526.64s)]
*  They started coming up with new human rights policy and a transparency report, trying to basically whitewash their record in human rights abuses. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=531.64s)]
*  And they started even like appointing new senior advisors to them. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=543.64s)]
*  And if you look at the list of those people, I mean, it's kind of comical like it's it's studded with like former Israeli official with records of defending war crimes, not at all the kind of people that you would trust protecting human rights. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=548.64s)]
*  And so, and this this all came with NSO groups insistence that it exclusively sold its products to governments, and I'll say more about that later because resorting to that defense is and is interesting in and of itself. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=563.64s)]
*  This was particularly newsy for NSO group. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=580.64s)]
*  It was, you know, a lot of reports came out this year about about NSO groups targeting of individuals who, you know, human rights activists politicians, etc. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=584.64s)]
*  One of the biggest stories of the year, really was this joint investigation that was done by Amnesty International and the group forbidden stories. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=599.64s)]
*  And it's revealed, I mean, while it didn't reveal for the first time that those being targeted by NSO were not really were not really to you know trying to avert crime or etc. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=612.64s)]
*  That the scope of NSO group was so wide it was, it was used much more widely than it was ever previously known and part of the leak was that there were there were 50,000 phone numbers that were on a list of possible targets of NSO technology of course [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=625.64s)]
*  And these stories cannot determine if every single one of those phone numbers was actually infected with NS with NSO group technology, because they would need to examine each and every phone and that's also a very long and difficult process because it requires, in some cases for the phone to be handed over to a lab, or for, you know, for the for the phone to extract a certain report that would be sent to expert analysts. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=645.64s)]
*  And after that, you know lawsuits and blacklists started piling up Apple sued NSO group this fall. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=670.64s)]
*  And it's kind of an interesting lawsuit because Apple wants to permanently ban NSO from ever using its software or devices. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=679.64s)]
*  But I think legally it's it's a bit interesting because, you know, Apple is Apple is suing NSO group on behalf of its users and for its interests because it wants to protect people supposedly from being hacked by by those by the groups who buy NSO technology. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=690.64s)]
*  But at the same time, you know, Apple doesn't really own the phones that have been hacked and NSO group is also not the person doing the spying but the you know but the group that is making the the the the spyware so it's it's I'm curious to see like what kind of precedent that will set. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=710.64s)]
*  After that, the US government blacklisted NSO group along with another Israeli firm called Candor. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=731.64s)]
*  And that's also interesting because that's not really. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=739.64s)]
*  It's not really like a form of sanctions because it definitely makes it more difficult for American companies and Americans to make business with those groups. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=745.64s)]
*  But it doesn't make it impossible. It just really moves it to like an extra level of difficulty. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=754.64s)]
*  It's you know those groups would require like a special license or an authorization to be able to make business with NSO group. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=762.64s)]
*  And almost a month after that came out after the after the US government really blacklisted NSO group Reuters revealed and in a special report where they cited some some unnamed sources that nine US State Department officials specializing in Uganda or are stationed in Uganda have been targeted by NSO group technology. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=770.64s)]
*  And after that, a group of long if US lawmakers that Democrats called for sanctions to be to be installed on NSO group and human rights groups are asking the European Union to follow suit and do the same thing. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=797.64s)]
*  So that's really those are the you know the major headlines about NSO group this year. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=814.64s)]
*  It's it's still unclear whether this is going to be kind of like the last nail in the coffin of NSO group. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=822.64s)]
*  But what's more interesting than that is even if NSO group is ASA like you say sued and blacklisted into oblivion. What's more interesting is like what comes after that and what that means for the rest of Israel's cyberware surveillance technology industry. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=830.64s)]
*  Yeah, what I found one of the things I found most interesting in this latest article that you've written that to Nora mentioned about in so group and you've done a great job this year, as every year of covering this story was the detail that it said that it mentioned you mentioned [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=849.64s)]
*  You mentioned two new Israeli cyber warfare groups, and one of them being formed by veterans of NSO itself so the rats are already deserting the sinking ship. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=867.64s)]
*  And you can imagine just the exact same things going on again. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=879.64s)]
*  You know, in a different company in a different form. And it also makes you think that, you know, Israel has been doing this kind of stuff for a long time but it's, you know, this particular company doesn't have a particularly good PR department or is not particularly good at [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=884.64s)]
*  soft, its software being detected. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=900.64s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, arguably, it's precisely those reports that at first were very good for NSO group, because it attracted clients like, you know, certain clients would look at these kinds of reports in the beginning and think, wow, and so group has technology that can [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=903.64s)]
*  really do something really amazing. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=920.64s)]
*  But I think it was, there was like an overdose at some point and it just became like a sinking ship like you say, but it's true I think now that NSO group is really struggling to not keeping not really being able to keep up with the PR as, as it's used to. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=922.64s)]
*  There are definitely other Israeli companies that are waiting to see what would happen and trying to also attract clients from from NSO and the two companies that you mentioned are our quadream and paragon. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=943.64s)]
*  And, like you say a lot of them are veterans of either NSO group or unit 8200 so much. I mean, it's all like a cesspool of the same thing they all come from the same roots, and they're essentially trying to do something very similar. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=959.64s)]
*  And the investors are also very interesting paragon has a hood but I'll the former Israeli Prime Minister as one of its investors. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=974.64s)]
*  And it's one of one of its selling points is that it's saying that it's not going to sell any of its, any of its products to authoritarian or undemocratic governments. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=986.64s)]
*  And of course like you so this is like the interesting part is that like the Israeli Defense Ministry and the Israeli government. I mean NSO group would not be able to sell its products without the Israeli government without approval from the Defense Ministry. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=999.64s)]
*  And it would not exist without it either because it's all of its roots come from the Israeli military. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1014.64s)]
*  But one way that the Israeli government tries to defend NSO group, especially in recent weeks after the US state, after the reports about the US State Department employees being targeted and about the blacklisting in the US. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1019.64s)]
*  One thing that the Israeli Defense Ministry did was that it said it was going to tighten controls over who gets to buy NSO group technology, and through like having a clearer definition of serious crime and terrorism. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1033.64s)]
*  And, I mean, this is comical because this is like the same Israeli Defense Ministry that considers Palestinian human rights groups to be terrorists so the definition is all warped up it just, it's, it doesn't make sense. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1052.64s)]
*  Yeah, one thing that really interests me for example is that it's not really about who this surveillance technology is being sold to. But whether such a technology should be able to exist in the first place I mean is, is this kind of, it's not the danger of who's holding the [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1067.64s)]
*  gun it's like it's the gun itself that's the danger. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1084.64s)]
*  Yeah, and also the thing I don't buy as well as this hands on sort of hands off plausible deniability thing they have of where they say the Israeli government says, and even NSO says sometimes oh, we don't have. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1088.64s)]
*  We don't necessarily control over how our products are used. And it's not us doing it. I mean I just don't buy that because you know these are multimillion pound contracts with these sort of golf dictatorships and you know oppressive regimes all over the [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1102.64s)]
*  world. And now we learn the Israeli secret police itself from one of these companies to Shin Bet. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1120.64s)]
*  And I just don't buy that they're like handing this software over like it's an old fashioned, like, you know, CD ROM that they're giving to give into them that could just be sort of pirated now these these will be like, it'll be highly sophisticated [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1127.64s)]
*  you know, software that's run on servers on websites that will require continued support by NSO group operatives, and at a minimum support you know if not actual operation. So I just don't buy this whole line that they're they're trying to kind of, it's a convenient [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1144.64s)]
*  thing basically. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1164.64s)]
*  Totally, and every single sale that is done to any of those, you know, countries if we're going to believe that NSO group claim that it's exclusively sells its technology to countries and law enforcement agencies. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1166.64s)]
*  The Israeli Defense Ministry would have to approve every single one of those sales. And, and this is something that was, you know, almost completely absent from the reports after the, you know, the biggest story of the year when the Forbidden Stories and the Amnesty International [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1182.64s)]
*  reports came out. The role of the Israeli government was almost absent, and it was it was being downplayed when I looked at the Guardian. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1195.64s)]
*  Sometimes they didn't even say that it was, it originated in Israel, like it was just some. Yeah. Yeah, the Guardian for example like Bailey mentioned it in the coverage and they weren't really big on the whole story it was just this kind of story of a rogue, a rogue corporation. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1204.64s)]
*  Yeah, totally and I and I think it all goes. I mean from from my observation and if I were to speculate it feels like NSO group is being portrayed as this uniquely evil corporation with which produces uniquely evil products in an otherwise benign surveillance [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1221.64s)]
*  surveillance industry. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1238.64s)]
*  And now it's being kind of like thrown under the bus by by people who are doing, you know, much of the same thing in order to save the rest of the industry. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1240.64s)]
*  Yeah, and it all the root of all this is of course unit 8200 which seems to be this essentially a training academy for global cyber criminals, and they and spies and spooks and mercenary spies of all sorts you know, the same people behind Black Cube. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1250.64s)]
*  That was involved in helping Harvey Weinstein to spy on his rape victims and try to find dirt on them and smear them in the public eye and so forth, you know, and these are just the ones we know about like how much more of this is going on. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1266.64s)]
*  So today, of course, I'll go ahead. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1285.64s)]
*  Oh no, I just wanted to say that this this recruitment from units 8200 is not only limited to Israel, the United Arab Emirates has a spy firm called Dark Matter which also directly recruits from units 8200 that's kind of it's becoming kind of like an international [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1288.64s)]
*  industry where units 8200 to like spy surveillance industry pipeline. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1305.64s)]
*  Yeah, this is I mean this is a real this is a real sort of intersection of your reporting tomorrow, where this kind of the whole Israeli cyber criminal industry is intersecting with them normalization and the Gulf Arab dictatorship's increasing the overt, I mean just fully over now ties and normalization with Israel. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1311.64s)]
*  And it's interesting like the role that this kind of played and must have played in the kind of recruitment of these, for one of a better word, recruitment of these monarchies and Gulf dictatorships towards normalization with Israel because they're sort of saying we'll see the kind of things we can do for you. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1335.64s)]
*  You know, and then example of that is the exporting of these oppressive technologies. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1356.64s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1362.64s)]
*  I mean, way before any of the Abraham Accords were signed in 2020. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1364.64s)]
*  Some of the earliest reports of covert relations were these kinds of sales. And what the Abraham Accords really did the Abraham Accords are the normalization deals that were signed between Israel and for Arab countries. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1371.64s)]
*  So, their phones were infected with Pegasus spyware, can you talk a little bit about this. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1447.64s)]
*  Yeah, just like this dystopian future that that Palestinians are already living with under Israeli occupation. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1454.64s)]
*  Sure. So, it was reported in the Israeli press in October that Israel had designated six prominent Palestinian human rights and social services organizations as terrorist groups. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1463.64s)]
*  And it was Israel's Defense Ministry that first made that designation. And the targeted groups learned about this designation by reading the Israeli press, so that just shows how anti democratic and how there's just no [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1478.64s)]
*  legitimate process by which Israel outlawed these groups. So, after the Defense Ministry made that designation. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1499.64s)]
*  The military followed suit and used possibly no longer applicable emergency laws in the West Bank to outlaw these six same groups, which means that the military can raid their offices at any time, seize their property, arrest their staff so it's it's really serious [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1510.64s)]
*  business. It's basically a nuclear option for Israel to shut these groups down. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1530.64s)]
*  And these groups have persisted in their work, including monitoring and documentation of human rights. So, these same repressive technologies and weapons that Israel is using against Palestinians they're documenting how it's being used. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1537.64s)]
*  And Israel of course then goes to arms fairs around the world and sells these technologies and repression technologies as fuel tested and of course that means fuel tested on the bodies of Palestinians. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1556.64s)]
*  So, at least three people we know of and I think there's three other people who have remained anonymous were targeted with NSO spyware on their phones. So, I believe a field worker for all hawk, which is a human rights organization and Ramallah. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1571.64s)]
*  And then there's also Salah Hamuri, who is a lawyer for all the mirror, and who is being Israel is attempting to deport him from Palestine, and has been embroiled in a legal battle with the state for years now, and the director of the sand, which is a Palestinian think tank. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1593.64s)]
*  I don't know if that's the right word but [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1620.64s)]
*  those three folks have been determined that NSO spyware was detected on their phones. After an expert review by Amnesty International and Citizen Lab. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1624.64s)]
*  And going back to what tomorrow was saying earlier about how invasive this Pegasus spyware is the wife of by a booty the director of the sand, describe just the sinking feeling. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1635.64s)]
*  And after learning that, like, their most intimate family life was being potentially recorded by the shin bet so it's like basically like having the shin that in your bedroom, if you are like most people and like, carry your phone around with you everywhere in your [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1651.64s)]
*  house. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1668.64s)]
*  So, yeah, I don't do that anymore. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1670.64s)]
*  I say that I try to do that. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1676.64s)]
*  And while this was coming out about the six Palestinian organizations being targeted or being blacklisted as terrorist groups by Israel, the Washington Post came out with this big story reporting on this biometric database that Israeli soldiers are building [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1682.64s)]
*  photograph any Palestinian that they interact with, especially in Hebron where they're like, like Palestinians have to like go through checkpoints just to get from one place in the city to another. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1707.64s)]
*  And so there's a, like, a lot of like contact between the military and Palestinians living in Hebron. This is the Blue Wolf thing that was just reported right. Yeah, so just like sold there, they were gamifying it so soldiers were being [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1720.64s)]
*  rewarded and like units in the army were being rewarded for like taking the most numbers of photos of Palestinians including children to put in this biometric database. So like the level of surveillance in Palestine by Israel is comprehensive. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1735.64s)]
*  And this is like this is not new, like when I was living there, like, 15 years ago, like, if someone went to the DCO office which is like the district coordinating officer, the Israeli military's officer, or the military, they, they could like [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1753.64s)]
*  they could like bring up a map of a Palestinian neighborhood and they would have every house every person living that house noted. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1771.64s)]
*  The, the level of surveillance isn't new because they do this so they can blackmail people if they find out, comparing my compromising information about someone they'll use that to try to get them to cooperate with the occupation, or they will use information [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1780.64s)]
*  against children to inform for the military about, you know, anything that the military might want to use against to break basically any Palestinian organizing and [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1803.64s)]
*  resistance to the occupation. But the advancement of the technology is the new thing. So that's Israel has always done this but it has greater tools to do this now. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1817.64s)]
*  And that's, yeah, that's that novelty I guess. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1831.64s)]
*  Yeah, when the stuff about Blue Wolf was exposed recently and you wrote about that didn't you Maureen, the Blue Wolf article. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1837.64s)]
*  And I think it was published in the Washington Post. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1849.64s)]
*  I think it was, because then you look back, you think about that and you think, huh, and then you, you see videos that you've already seen online before that in a different light so I remember there was one video of Israeli soldiers just invading a Palestinian [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1853.64s)]
*  home in the middle of the night, and just taking photos of the children you think they were probably trying to get these prizes for this Blue Wolf thing. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1870.64s)]
*  You know, as they, you know, as you said the gamifying it absolutely insane stuff. Again, it's not new because yeah, when I was living in the West Bank as well it was the same very common scenario for Palestinian homes to just be sort of invaded and [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1879.64s)]
*  raided at any time at the whim of the soldiers and the officers in the area. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1893.64s)]
*  But it's this new sort of insidious level of technology that has really brought the surveillance level to almost absolute level it seems. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1899.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1909.64s)]
*  And it's like, ironic isn't even, I don't think doesn't have the gravity to describe. While Israel has this capability that we all know it uses it also claims to have not known that the Associated Press has had offices in a tower that it bombed and destroyed in Gaza. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1911.64s)]
*  So you can you can't have both things at the same time to claim to not know that Al Jazeera and AP were were housed in this building. And then, and maybe there was like Hamas. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1934.64s)]
*  They claimed that Hamas had like some kind of like, like special intelligence unit in the building. But, but even then they haven't produced any evidence to to back up this claim, and yet we know the level of information that they have on everywhere in the West [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1950.64s)]
*  Bank and Gaza. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1971.64s)]
*  Yeah, they bombed it to the ground because they could at the end of the day. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1973.64s)]
*  Yeah, and that's going back to what you were just saying Asa about these night raids, partly, partly it's to gather information on people but mainly it's to terrorize them. Yeah, it's to remind Palestinians that we're in charge, and we can leverage this power over you at [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1977.64s)]
*  And so when Human Rights Watch put out these reports on Israel's targeting of towers and Gaza in May, and calling them apparent war crimes with unclear military objectives, as though there were any when it like Israeli leaders said themselves that nowhere in Gaza is immune [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=1994.64s)]
*  to terror, that's what Benny Gantz, Israel's defense minister said. So, the whole point has been to terrorize people, then that's been their principal military strategy. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2020.64s)]
*  And that's also the same strategy with the siege on Gaza that's been in place since 2007 and apparently the so called internet international community is as happy for that to become as permanent as the occupation itself. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2032.64s)]
*  So, that's, that's what it comes down to is just breaking Palestinian unity, breaking Palestinian society and crushing any opposition to the occupation and colonization of Palestinian land. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2054.64s)]
*  Let's talk a little bit more about the attacks on Gaza, and in the West Bank. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2073.64s)]
*  In May of this year. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2081.64s)]
*  I mean, you know, again just unmitigated violence by Israel, supported by its allies, but we also saw this cohesion of pan Palestinian solidarity you know Palestinians who have been separated by Israel in, you know, in enclaves in Gaza, in the occupied West [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2085.64s)]
*  Bank, and inside historic Palestine 48. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2109.64s)]
*  And there was there was this kind of unanimous rising up against Israeli colonization and violence and resistance force I mean we covered this in a podcast back in May with Ali and john Elmer. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2113.64s)]
*  You know who we're talking about the, the, you know, the heightened technologies of Palestinian resistance factions, and how Israel actually wasn't able to do things like a full scale ground invasion, because of the capabilities of Palestinian resistance. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2132.64s)]
*  What do you both think of, you know, looking back now it's, you know, what's been seven months since then. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2150.64s)]
*  And what what has changed in terms of Israel's capabilities. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2159.64s)]
*  You know to, you know, just to have this unmute you know, just unmitigated violence. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2166.64s)]
*  But what has changed in terms of Palestinian resistance and, and, and the cohesion of Palestinian society, no matter where they're placed or displaced. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2173.64s)]
*  Tamara, do you want to go first or do you have any first thoughts? [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2190.64s)]
*  Um, I mean, looking back at May. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2195.64s)]
*  I think, while we were reporting on it at the time. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2201.64s)]
*  There were a lot of new things that were happening and it was all very shocking. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2205.64s)]
*  I think, you know, I think that there was a lot of relief in the measure of just the sheer amount of brutality that Israel was unleashing on Gaza, but at the same time at the resilience of the resistance. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2211.64s)]
*  I think the really inspired hope is to see this national unity among Palestinians in the West Bank in 48 and in Gaza, and in the diaspora in a way that was, you know, the last time we've seen something like that was in, you know, the second intifada. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2228.64s)]
*  And maybe it has to do with, you know, how connected everyone, you know, this is like one of the most connected times we have, there was the internet there was Instagram people were sharing everywhere you look you would see pictures and videos and news and headlines. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2256.64s)]
*  And I think you know this is a thought I had at the time, but it's important to be moderate in what we expect of the resistance to because [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2277.64s)]
*  You know there was this, there were moments of great pride and knowing that the resistance in Gaza is not going to stand by as Israel raids the Al Aqsa mosque and unleashes, you know, rubber coated steel bullets and tear gas inside the mosque as worshippers. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2290.64s)]
*  And there was this like sense of national pride that we have a resistance that that defends us and it doesn't only defend people and as it defends Palestinians, wherever it can, it can, it can reach. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2310.64s)]
*  So that was really inspiring and I think, you know, like I said it's just important to be moderate in what we expect of this resistance and I don't think any of those events can be can can liberate Palestine at once but I think it definitely taught Israel a lesson that that it cannot [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2324.64s)]
*  continue to do those things without being punished by the resistance and I think, you know, that was very important. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2347.64s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I think, I think that it was the first time I can think of really that the, as you said, the ability of the resistance in Gaza specifically to act, not only in the self defense of the Gaza Strip but in self defense of Palestinians in Jerusalem, specifically, but all over Palestine, but it was [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2358.64s)]
*  it's not the first time that that was their stated aim but it seems to be such a clear expression of defending Jerusalem, the capital of Palestine from the attacks of Jewish supremacists essentially in Jerusalem, attacking and driving out Palestinians you know chanting [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2385.64s)]
*  death to Arabs and so forth. In a very narrow way you might sort of think well you know why would they do that. This is just a, this is an armed group in Gaza, they should stick to defending Gaza, but you know the Palestinian resistance has never seen things that way they've [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2407.64s)]
*  seen it as a national defense organization against occupation and settler colonialism. So it was, yeah, it seemed to me that it was like it was a real sort of unifying moment for the Palestinian body politic in a way, right, people themselves. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2425.64s)]
*  Yeah, and I mean, Israel being the sadomasochist that it is didn't know how to respond to this kind of national unity and power with the resistance despite them not having the kind of military technology that Israel has. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2445.64s)]
*  And so it did things like bomb the Associated Press building and I'll just you know I'll just hear building it's obliterated entire families in their homes, because that's the only language and knows how to speak, which is like punishing the weakest people in Gaza in order to try to, like you [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2460.64s)]
*  describe Maureen the Dahi doctrine, try to force them into submission and still that was not possible. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2481.64s)]
*  Yeah, I think it points to, you know, so Palestinians in Gaza are never going to achieve like a clear and decisive military victory over Israel and like the conventional military sense, but that's not what a resistance and gorilla, you know organization [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2489.64s)]
*  is even going to aim to do just surviving and like clinging on to your ground is a victory. And when we see headlines like we are this week, the AP had a story, basically saying well it's been 15 years of siege and Hamas isn't going anywhere. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2508.64s)]
*  So, Israel is having to learn how to live with Hamas. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2526.64s)]
*  And the fact that Hamas has been able to develop and improve its capacity of its armed wing under this comprehensive blockade is something. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2531.64s)]
*  I mean I agree with tomorrow that we should speak with you know some sobriety about the resistance, like it's not helpful to like, I mean glorify things, necessarily but we can recognize that they were able to develop an arsenal that they said and [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2548.64s)]
*  that they believed that they could launch rockets towards Tel Aviv and shut down the country for like for months. I fully agree with that and I think at the same time the other side of that is that we should continue to sort of speak out against this. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2575.64s)]
*  There is this really annoying tendency amongst some sort of Western leftists of sort of saying oh well they just firecracker rockets out of Gaza. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2591.64s)]
*  I said that at the beginning of that so I'm going to like own up to that but that was to say that you can't compare Israel's bunker buster bombs to what what Palestinians have and yet that is what groups like Human Rights Watch do when when they unequivocally [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2601.64s)]
*  condemn the firing of unguided missiles from Gaza versus Israel's you know high precision guided missiles that they launched into like the middle of like the most densely populated place on the planet. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2623.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2641.64s)]
*  Right, but I disrupted your thought Asa sorry. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2642.64s)]
*  I was just wanting to. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2645.64s)]
*  How did you say that. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2647.64s)]
*  I said that on Twitter at some point just to, because, you know, [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2649.64s)]
*  People say well what about Hamas's rockets what about the rockets what about the rockets, but the rockets are like the only way that Palestinians under blockade in Gaza have any leverage over over Israel, like, if, like, and what do you want Palestinians to do when when, you know, [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2656.64s)]
*  People like in the Democratic Party are against the boycott divestment and sanctions movement. So they're like against any Palestinian form of, like, unarmed organized organizing, and they condemn that. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2680.64s)]
*  Yeah, and then Palestinians don't have any right to self defense using missiles under blockade for, you know, more than a decade that has like paralyzed life in Gaza. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2694.64s)]
*  I think the best the best response to what about the Rockets probably came from the I hear sin were in his interview after the war when he said that. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2706.64s)]
*  Okay, then well you know, give us guided weaponry then right, we wish we don't have, you know, right. But at the same time he made it clear that we're not we're not targeting. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2714.64s)]
*  I mean, I think that's the way that we're trying to do it. I mean, I think that's the way that we're trying to do it. I mean, I think that's the way that we're trying to do it. I mean, I think that's the way that we're trying to do it. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2725.64s)]
*  But that that also includes. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2740.64s)]
*  Yeah, I wasn't, I wasn't really including you in this Murray but I do think there is a tendency to kind of, from some Western leftist kind of discount armed resistance altogether, as you know as illegitimate in the first place when it comes to Israel uniquely for some reason. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2745.64s)]
*  And also just say well it can't win, which is just historically not true, like this is historically and factually not true. Yes, it's they're not going to win a conventional overwhelming military battle in the sense of, you know, columns of Soviet tanks, fighting the [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2766.64s)]
*  Nazis that it's not that kind of war it's a, it's a guerrilla war, which, which can win simply by surviving, as you said, you know, right. Yeah. And what I when I said, you know, we have to be moderate about what to expect of the resistance I was really talking about a very specific [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2787.64s)]
*  moment in May during the war when there was this feeling of complete loss of the tragedy that was happening, but then a sense of pride in what the you know and what the resistance and how the resistance was responding. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2805.64s)]
*  And, you know, I agree with Maureen it's a complete marvel that that the resistance was able to not only survive but advance under an Israeli siege, where Palestinians and Gaza are monitored 24 seven. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2822.64s)]
*  And every, you know, and Gaza is not like the southern Lebanon, it's not like filled with mountains where there is like some kind of obscurity with the landscape, it's almost completely flat. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2839.64s)]
*  It's, it's, it's on a coast. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2851.64s)]
*  And so to be able to create this kind of sophisticated and like underground infrastructure, and to be able to develop this kind of weaponry which by the way I don't think its intent was ever to really hurt Israeli civilians I don't think that's the intent and I don't think it's helpful. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2855.64s)]
*  And the, the, the, I mean what it's actually does is, it creates a sense of permanent emergency for Israel, that if you continue to terrorize Palestinian lives we will not sit here and die in silence. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2876.64s)]
*  I mean, they mock, you know they they mock the rockets but at the same time it's, it has sent the country completely under. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2891.64s)]
*  It's closed the country completely for a few days, the airports closed. And that's cost Israel, millions of dollars for its economy for its tourism, and most importantly for its image, the rockets are the most complete form of BDS because the artists and can't fly into the [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2901.64s)]
*  air pool. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2918.64s)]
*  The two rocket solution. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2921.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2923.64s)]
*  And there's no military solution to the rockets like you can't, it can't defeat like it, you know, it can try to bomb like individual rocket units but like it's never, it's never going to be able to wipe out that capacity the resistance and it's proven to not have any [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2924.64s)]
*  solution to the tunnels that are underground in Gaza, there, there was a very interesting analysis in the, I think the London Review of books by a L Weitzman, the last week or so, and it had a very good title I think it was called tunnel vision. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2945.64s)]
*  And I think it was something about Israel's military strategy in Gaza. And during the worst night of the war. We saw many Palestinians tweeting, just with like they never in all the, the success of wars that Israel has launched on Gaza, one, you know the next one worse than the [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2964.64s)]
*  And people had never experienced, like the physical sensations of. I think it was the May, the night of May 13, when Israel dropped some, I think, 451 ton bombs that had a delayed destination, so they would be embedded in the ground and then designated so it was like [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=2988.64s)]
*  created earthquake like effects that could be felt within Israel. Yeah, yeah, so that was something that hadn't ever been experienced before. And what Israel was trying to do, and this was under the direction of [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3013.64s)]
*  launch a ground invasion. And so they use the foreign press to report this. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3064.64s)]
*  They made it seem like that they had tanks lined up along the boundary in an effort to draw Hamas into like Hamas fighters into like a certain concentration the tunnels and they would target that and the goal was into one swell one fell swoop to basically [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3072.64s)]
*  incapacitate the resistance in Gaza, and they were very confident, it seems that this was going to work, and it didn't. So, at first the Israeli claim that it had it. That was a major victory but in the months that followed, there was acknowledgement [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3093.64s)]
*  And Israeli press in the Israeli press at least that it was actually a major failure because they did not achieve Hamas did not fall into the trap that they wanted to. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3111.64s)]
*  So, you know, you can look at the situation in Gaza now, it's as bad as it ever was. And that's maybe what I'm saying by like, I'm wary of, you know, glorifying, like, especially for people who aren't Palestinians living outside of [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3122.64s)]
*  Palestine to say like, you know, steadfastness and some mood and all this, you know, when it like the everyone in Gaza know somebody, somebody who's like [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3140.64s)]
*  Like the social economic effects and of the siege and Israel's constant punishing of Palestinians to Gaza for refusing to surrender the armed resistance has such a profoundly negative impact on people there. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3156.64s)]
*  I mean everybody knows somebody who's attempted to, you know, go on smuggling boats to Europe. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3174.64s)]
*  And suicide rates are really high. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3184.64s)]
*  And young people just don't see. There's like no future for them on the horizon. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3189.64s)]
*  So that's what I'm where I'm coming from when I'm saying like it's the situation in Gaza is, is so bad. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3195.64s)]
*  And I think that's why it's up to people on the outside to organize more effectively, so that there is a cost on Israel, and to change to help change as much as we can. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3204.64s)]
*  That power equation, so Israel can't keep getting away with this like it does after each assault on Gaza. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3222.64s)]
*  We just have a few minutes left. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3232.64s)]
*  And there's so much to talk about, as always, we've, we've, it's been quite a year. Yeah, we didn't even get into the half. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3235.64s)]
*  Yeah, we have so much good journalism on our website I, I was looking in preparation for this episode I was looking at some of my own stories, and [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3244.64s)]
*  Yeah, there's so much that you do, they sort of forget about anything that actually happened that's crazy. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3256.64s)]
*  And I think one of the things we probably don't have much time now to talk about it very much but one of the things I really enjoyed in your report in this year Maureen was the, the whole human rights industrial complex as it were. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3264.64s)]
*  And your articles criticizing Human Rights Watch and others for their [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3282.64s)]
*  coverage of Palestine in a really kind of, I mean you've alluded to it already in this conversation really. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3289.64s)]
*  And maybe, could you talk maybe just a little bit about that. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3297.64s)]
*  Yeah, so, um, after the May War, sometime in August, Human Rights Watch started publishing these reports that detailed Israel's bombing campaign in Gaza during May, and their first report was really harrowing reading because they include testimony from Palestinians [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3302.64s)]
*  that just like it, it was, it was very difficult to read. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3323.64s)]
*  So I want to acknowledge that. I don't envy these stories, you know, because they are, I mean it's traumatic just to read about it, let alone to go through it. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3329.64s)]
*  Yes, I mean, so I'm trying to give Human Rights Watch credit where credit is due like it's important to do this documentation but their, their framework, their analytical framework is just so, so narrow. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3338.64s)]
*  So, they treat him like Hamas, the military wing of Hamas and Israel as though they are equal parties. And while also giving Israel the benefit of the doubt so as I mentioned earlier, they because Palestinian resistance missiles are unguided because they're [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3352.64s)]
*  they're sanctioned, they don't like have access to like Boeing weapons like the United States does not sell precision guided weapons to Hamas, like which is just, it's even absurd to even have to like explain right this out. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3372.64s)]
*  Absolutely. So, like that's what they have, and because they're unguided, they're inherently indiscriminate and firing indiscriminate weapons towards civilian population centers is prohibited under international humanitarian law which is the law of war. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3390.64s)]
*  So, like, if you're Hamas firing weapon, these unguided missiles out of Gaza, by this logic means that that's an inherent war crime. Meanwhile, Israel launching, it's like 155 millimeter artillery shells into like the most densely populated place or one of them on the planet [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3410.64s)]
*  does not, [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3431.64s)]
*  does not fall into the same category as like inherently indiscriminate, nor does its bunker buster missiles like dropped on a Wednesday Street in Gaza City, which I don't understand how that logic wouldn't apply. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3434.64s)]
*  So, it's a different bias towards states in international law, and if you dig into the history of it. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3453.64s)]
*  The whole framework of international law was invented by imperialist states and colonizers to serve their own aims and protect their like colonial acquisitions from one another. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3461.64s)]
*  And it's evolved and changed over time and now we're kind of in like the counter terror. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3474.64s)]
*  So it was to protect the rights of Britain against France or France against Portugal right it wasn't to protect the rights of the indigenous people that they were colonizing and dispossessing. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3481.64s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3493.64s)]
*  So, that's the legacy of international law serving to basically consolidate imperial interests that, like I think human groups like Human Rights Watch need to think more critically about because they're perpetuating this by giving Israel the benefit of the doubt, [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3494.64s)]
*  And they're calling for sanctions on arms trade to Israel, which they still call like security assistance. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3519.64s)]
*  If, if they were like morally consistent on this, they would be calling for like increased security assistance to Palestinians in Gaza, by like saying that if if they don't like unguided missiles being fired at. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3528.64s)]
*  Then we then give them precision guided missiles. It's like they have the right to defend themselves they have the right to self defense Israel as a colonizing power does not have that right there's, it's like a no logical thing to say that Israel as the colonizer [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3548.64s)]
*  is acting out of self defense when it's bombarding Gaza, so I, I hope through writing about this that people think more critically about like the human rights paradigm in in Palestine, and how it can be used to criminalize resistance against a foreign colonizer, like, which is, you know, [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3565.64s)]
*  the story of resistance in Gaza. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3593.64s)]
*  And finally let's, let's look ahead to 2022 I mean pandemic is going we're going into the third year of this pandemic. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3599.64s)]
*  There's still vast medical apartheid happening in Palestine, along with regular old political apartheid. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3609.64s)]
*  What, what can, what do you think we can expect in terms of, you know, the humanitarian humanitarian situation in Palestine, amidst this pandemic. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3619.64s)]
*  And, and as Palestinians continue to fight for liberation. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3632.64s)]
*  I think that's a really massive question. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3639.64s)]
*  And you have 30 seconds. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3643.64s)]
*  I'm just kidding. And unfortunately I think that I tend to think things always get worse. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3646.64s)]
*  I wish I have a better answer than that, but it just feels like, you know, when the pandemic started. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3654.64s)]
*  And I think that the brief moment when it felt like at least we were all in this together. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3663.64s)]
*  We were on the brink of something really massive, and it was difficult to understand what to expect. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3672.64s)]
*  And so the pandemic kind of exacerbated all the already existing injustice in the world and so this. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3679.64s)]
*  Everything just became clearer and even worse. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3688.64s)]
*  And, you know, first this tragedy than as far as and like 2021 was all about the vaccine inequality, and it started to feel like more divided with coven with people. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3692.64s)]
*  You know, trying their best to move forward and away from this pandemic, and, you know, vaccine quality and people who refuse to take the vaccine and etc. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3707.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's, it's, it's hard to make a prediction or to speculate I tried to, I try not to. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3719.64s)]
*  And it's also hard to be hopeful. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3729.64s)]
*  But we have to just keep doing the work that we're already doing. And I think that's really all we can do. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3733.64s)]
*  Maureen. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3745.64s)]
*  Well, I'm very curious to see what happens with the case of Palestine at the International Criminal Court. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3747.64s)]
*  So going back to what I was saying earlier about [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3754.64s)]
*  international law being something that can be used. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3760.64s)]
*  Basically, or the bias towards state against like a like guerrilla resistance. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3763.64s)]
*  So so far, the new chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court. He's so, just to go back a little bit in March of last of this year, still 2021 for a few more days in March of this year, Fatou Ben Souda, the chief prosecutor at the time, [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3772.64s)]
*  Opened a formal investigation into war crimes and the West Bank and Gaza Strip and that concluded a five year preliminary investigation, which on top of that was on top of another preliminary investigation so like the, it's been a very long and prolonged process [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3791.64s)]
*  with the ICC. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3810.64s)]
*  Whether Kareem Khan, the new chief prosecutor of the ICC, who took Ben Souda's place after her term expired in June, actually pursues Palestine. That's the big question. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3813.64s)]
*  I, you know, seeing is, is believing is how I'm feeling about that. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3828.64s)]
*  So, the case of Palestine at the ICC is basically a legitimacy test for the court, which has thus far only prosecuted African nationals and Palestine is [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3837.64s)]
*  So, it's a test of the independence of the court. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3854.64s)]
*  I think Palestine could be the thing that makes or breaks it. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3870.64s)]
*  So I'm very curious to see what happens. We could, it could be, to going back to what I was saying earlier about the bias in international law towards states. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3876.64s)]
*  It could be and other people have, who know more about international law and pay attention to the ICC very closely have said that it could very well be that the ICC goes after only the lowest hanging fruit, which would be like Hamas and Gaza. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3889.64s)]
*  So, whether that's going to be the case, I'm a little bit skeptical of because Israel's settlement enterprise in the West Bank is such a open and shut case of the violation of international law and it's obviously approved by like the top levels of the Israeli government. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3905.64s)]
*  I mean, it's the whole modus operandi of the state's why it exists to expand its territory in Palestine. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3926.64s)]
*  So that's something I'm going to be paying attention to. So far, Kareem Khan hasn't said anything publicly about Israel's targeting and blacklisting the Palestinian human rights groups that the ICC works with very closely and which has provided evidence to the ICC. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3934.64s)]
*  And the situation is such that with the blacklisting of these human rights groups, Israel can raid their offices and potentially gather information and endanger Palestinian witnesses who have testified to these groups for the ICC's case. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3956.64s)]
*  So, to me it's like scandalous that the ICC hasn't said anything publicly about this yet. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3977.64s)]
*  And to kind of tie in this to the NSO group, which was the thing that we started off this conversation about, I forgot to mention that there was reporting in the Israeli press by Rodin Bergman who seems very, very close and well connected to Israel's intelligence [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=3985.64s)]
*  agencies that the fact that Israel designated these six groups as terrorist organizations was to retroactively justify the use of Pegasus spyware against these organizations. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=4005.64s)]
*  So that's why the timing happened the way it did. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=4021.64s)]
*  That speaks to my point about the connections, the deep and intimate connections between these mercenary cyber criminals and the Israeli state itself. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=4026.64s)]
*  Yeah, I would question whether there is a line. Like this is probably just a state agency. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=4035.64s)]
*  That's what's being questioned in the Israeli press to the extent that gag orders don't prevent them from doing so. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=4041.64s)]
*  Yeah, which is why it's totally comical that their only line of defense is how can we use these products more ethically, which, you know, it's just. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=4051.64s)]
*  Sorry about that. We promise to do better. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=4062.64s)]
*  Yeah, but it doesn't speak to like the inherently unethical nature of the products themselves. They just simply should not exist. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=4066.64s)]
*  I find the conversation very similar to the gun rights conversation, which is, it's not really, you know, it's not really who's holding the gun. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=4073.64s)]
*  It's just the gun itself is what creates the danger to begin with. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=4086.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=4091.64s)]
*  Well, with that. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPof-5DDKM4&t=4094.64s)]
