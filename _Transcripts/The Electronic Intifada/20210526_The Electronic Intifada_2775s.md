# The myth of Israel's self-defense and media coverage of Palestine with Greg Shupak | EI Podcast
**The Electronic Intifada:** [May 26, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A)
*  The idea of Israeli self-defense involves sort of like picking some arbitrary starting point [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=0.0s)]
*  when Palestinians fought back and then being like yeah that's the first blood in this conflict. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=17.28s)]
*  I'm Nora Barrows-Freedman and this is the Electronic Intifada Podcast. Joining us to talk about media [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=30.0s)]
*  suppression and coverage in the mainstream corporate media is Greg Schupack. He's a contributor to the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=45.76s)]
*  Electronic Intifada and just wrote a piece in FAIR, Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, called [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=51.68s)]
*  Israel-Palestine Coverage Presents False Equivalency Between Occupied and Occupier. Greg, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=57.28s)]
*  it's so good to have you with us on the Electronic Intifada Podcast. Thanks so much for having me. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  As I said to you when you emailed me, I was going to get in touch to beg to come on so I [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=70.24000000000001s)]
*  appreciate that you saved me the humiliation. You're totally welcome anytime. So Greg, give us a sense [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=75.60000000000001s)]
*  of, you know, I mean it, you know, we've been through this so many times, so many decades, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=84.96s)]
*  73 years of spin on Israel's settler colonial program in Palestine. Lay out kind of the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=92.63999999999999s)]
*  foundation of what you wrote the other day and what you're seeing in terms of coverage [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=102.08s)]
*  in mainstream corporate media versus reality on the ground. Sure, well you know there's [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=108.32s)]
*  a variety of different approaches that we see in the coverage. You do see people that are [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=114.8s)]
*  engaging in out and out bloodlust, you know, like Brett Stevens in the New York Times and people [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=123.12s)]
*  writing a Wall Street Journal who are just, you know, full on calling for [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=130.72s)]
*  whatever they see as total Israeli victory and we can kind of imagine what that looks like. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=137.36s)]
*  Those certainly exist and are not rare. The, I think, more common approach this time around [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=146.96s)]
*  in mainstream news media in the U.S. and from what I can tell Britain and also Canada is [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  the both sides approach or the and the Israel has a right to defend itself approach. Right. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=160.96s)]
*  And the two can kind of blend together. So, you know, as I've, I'll take those in reverse order, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=167.36s)]
*  but as I've mentioned before, there's, or as I wrote I should say in my book and in an extract [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=174.16000000000003s)]
*  for on Electronic Adifada, the, you know, the idea of Israeli self-defeat is that the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=181.12s)]
*  idea of Israeli self-defense involves sort of like picking some arbitrary starting point [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=189.2s)]
*  when Palestinians fought back and then being like, yeah, that's the first blood in this conflict. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=194.64s)]
*  That's what, you know, was so surprised they resisted being thrown off their homes and their [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=200.0s)]
*  land. Yeah, it's weird. It's weird how, you know, only Palestinians are the only people in history [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=204.95999999999998s)]
*  who kind of object to being murdered and dispossessed and, you know, suffering [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=211.6s)]
*  gruesome debilitating injuries and humiliation at every corner. So, yeah, they do this weird thing [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=218.4s)]
*  where they eventually get fed up with that. And then when they get fed up with that, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=226.95999999999998s)]
*  that's when the violence quote unquote starts. And, you know, we have, of course, that being [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=231.36s)]
*  arbitrary and totally dubious, but it also relies on like erasing all these permanent forms of [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  Israeli violence. So in the case of fighting coming from a resistance coming from Gaza, we can [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=251.68s)]
*  just look at a simple fact like the siege, right? The siege is an act of warfare. It's enforced [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=259.28000000000003s)]
*  militarily by the Israeli Navy, Air Force, and, you know, by the snipers at the, along the fence. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=266.0s)]
*  So, you know, this is an act of war when there's a siege in place. When you're besieging a [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=274.72s)]
*  population, you cannot claim when that population, you know, fights back at some point to be, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=280.96s)]
*  you know, the victim, right? To be merely responding to what they do. They're responding [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=290.0s)]
*  to the siege among other factors. And that, of course, is without even getting into the [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=295.2s)]
*  bigger picture, longer term history, which the two of you know, and I assume many of your readers [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=300.08s)]
*  do, and we can talk about that if you want. But, you know, the fact that I'm, what I'm driving at [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=305.28s)]
*  there is just that we have this completely untenable Israeli right to defense so-called [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=311.44s)]
*  that gets invoked over and over again, which is based on picking this entirely selective [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=318.55999999999995s)]
*  set of facts and excluding others. The corollary, of course, is that there's [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=327.44s)]
*  never any consideration of the Palestinian right to defense or right to resist or right [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=334.8s)]
*  to liberate themselves. So I recently wrote in Jacobin about this, where I looked at the [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=342.16s)]
*  every, the New York Times, Washington Post, USA Today, LA Times, and Wall Street Journal for this [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=348.32s)]
*  entire century. There's 100, there's, I think, 400 some references to the alleged Israeli right [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=355.68s)]
*  to defend itself and zero, well actually, no, not zero, two references, basically the same article [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=364.08s)]
*  published twice, to a Palestinian that mentioned a Palestinian right to defend themselves. And that [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=369.84s)]
*  was a quote from a guy who was basically kicked out of the U.S. military because he said Palestinians [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=376.71999999999997s)]
*  have a right to defend themselves and other similar things. So that is a, that concept is [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=383.44s)]
*  non-existent in mainstream media and thus is not going to penetrate a lot of the popular consciousness. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=389.92s)]
*  I mentioned also the both sides narrative, so this similarly rests on obscuring all kinds of [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=397.44s)]
*  power asymmetries that exist. So it's in the title of my FAIR article gets to it, the idea that [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=404.88s)]
*  both sides are at fault or both sides are suffering to comparable degrees or [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=415.52000000000004s)]
*  or that both sides have made comparable mistakes or whatever these talking points are, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=423.04s)]
*  you see them over and over again. This all involves, this only could make sense if it were, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=432.08000000000004s)]
*  I don't know, say a civil war between two equal powers or two states maybe with roughly comparable [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=438.56s)]
*  degrees of military strength and economic and political power, not colonizer and colonizer, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=447.28000000000003s)]
*  occupier and occupied. The fact is that when you're talking in terms of both sides suffering, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=454.64s)]
*  for example, well you're obviously drawing this completely false equivalency between the damage [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=464.64s)]
*  being done right now and in the longer history, but it's also, there's also a qualitative difference [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=472.56s)]
*  where colonial and imperial violence is treated as no different from anti-colonial counter violence [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=480.24s)]
*  as though the effort of the people to liberate themselves were the kind of moral and legal [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=491.36s)]
*  equivalent of the effort to snuff out those liberation movements. So this is really [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=503.44s)]
*  predominant, we can talk about examples, but this both sidesism is probably the most or at least [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=512.4s)]
*  colmos with the Israeli right to defense as far as frames for the coverage. And the other main thing [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=519.04s)]
*  I would point out about the coverage is that there's just so much that's left out and [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=525.1999999999999s)]
*  that can be something like the intensified closures. So I talk about this a little bit in the [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=536.4s)]
*  article and so the closure of that crossing intensifies the blockade, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=545.92s)]
*  and this is part of the war that Israel's currently carrying out. So this keeps out things like [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=557.4399999999999s)]
*  aid, for example, like it even further reduces humanitarian aid, which the siege already does. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=567.4399999999999s)]
*  It jeopardizes the food supply, well actually more accurately, it jeopardizes the electricity supply, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=573.2800000000001s)]
*  which has residual effects across the economy, so that you know the economy and the social safety [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=584.08s)]
*  net, so that undermines things like the hospitals. And what I was going to say about food was that the [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=590.96s)]
*  intensified closures of sea access, there was the tightening of already draconian restrictions for [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=599.12s)]
*  Gaza fishers that have been implemented. This, like the Karim Shalom closing, has been more or [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=607.92s)]
*  less completely absent from the coverage. There's no indication of the fact in this coverage that [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=616.24s)]
*  68.5% of Palestinians by the World Food Program's calculation who live in Gaza are [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=623.92s)]
*  food insecure, and I think one article that mentioned major U.S. media that I looked at, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=632.8000000000001s)]
*  the one that mentioned the increased restrictions on fishers from Gaza, didn't mention that this [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=639.6s)]
*  will further harm the food supply. So you have a total absence of the fact that the population [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=647.2s)]
*  living there is already food insecure, combined with a total erasure of the fact that Israel is [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=655.0400000000001s)]
*  taking actions that are virtually certain to worsen that food insecurity, because that fish [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=663.12s)]
*  is now removed from the equation. There's virtually no references to the fact that [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=670.48s)]
*  Gaza is basically a giant refugee camp, and that is significant for, because that kind of you know [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=676.5600000000001s)]
*  shapes people's whole understanding of what's happening, right? If people just you know come [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=684.64s)]
*  to have the information that tells them, oh actually this is Israel bombing a territory [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=692.08s)]
*  full of people that are refugees, and the reason they're refugees is because Israel made them [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=697.52s)]
*  refugees and refused to let them to go home and thus not be refugees anymore, then that kind of [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=702.0s)]
*  whole you know series of categories of information really alters the way that the whole dynamic [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=709.1999999999999s)]
*  across Palestine looks to people who have that information. But when there's no effort to [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=717.1999999999999s)]
*  let audiences understand that these are refugees primarily in Gaza, then that is the kind of thing [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=727.68s)]
*  that enables it to be framed as a matter of both sides, or self-defense for that matter. How you [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=736.88s)]
*  know Israel can't be defending itself against people that it made into refugees and forces to [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=743.4399999999999s)]
*  continue being refugees. And it's not, I want to talk a little bit about like the top-down [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=749.28s)]
*  you know structure for these corporate media, you know kind of like dictates. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=758.0s)]
*  So a few days ago an internal memo was leaked, there's a CNN like you know some sort of like [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=765.92s)]
*  high up in the CNN officialdom had instructed the news you know bureau and all of the writers [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=775.6s)]
*  and whatever to always put Hamas run before talking about the Ministry of Health in Gaza for [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=784.72s)]
*  example, or you know any sort of governmental ministry, the you know police force, the traffic [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=794.08s)]
*  you know cops, the government clinics, the you know banks, that they all had to be prefaced with [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=800.72s)]
*  Hamas run. And you know someone on Twitter yesterday was pointing out like why don't we [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=808.24s)]
*  talk about as like Likud run you know social security or like the Likud run you know hospitals. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=814.64s)]
*  Israel is always framed as this like neutral, benign, you know sort of like the normal sort of [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=822.72s)]
*  society, whereas the you know of course you know demonization of Palestinians and Arabs and Muslims [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=834.72s)]
*  and people all over the Middle East of course decades have been gone have gone into this. But [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=841.84s)]
*  designating you know really kind of explicitly and specifically designating anything run by [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=847.76s)]
*  you know by the Gaza government as Hamas run. What does that do to the reader and [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=856.8000000000001s)]
*  how can you explain this you know this dictate from the higher-ups at CNN to do that? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=865.6s)]
*  Yeah that's a really that's a really just telling and stunning [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=872.24s)]
*  revelation. Yeah I mean it's something that is consequential because of the [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=878.24s)]
*  you know intense propaganda against Hamas really since they've existed. Certainly since the second [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=887.92s)]
*  Intifada and their election in 2006. So yeah I mean that's I think what's going on there is [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=896.16s)]
*  it's an effort to legitimize Israeli violence against civilian targets, against the institutions [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=908.48s)]
*  of Palestinian social reproduction. Because yeah Israel bombed a hospital sounds bad but [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=916.3199999999999s)]
*  Israel you know bombed a Hamas run hospital makes it sound as though this is a has some sort of like [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=923.52s)]
*  military element to it. It must be you know involved in nefarious violent [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=932.4s)]
*  activities because it's attached to Hamas which is understood already from a long-term [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=943.4399999999999s)]
*  concerted propaganda effort to be that and only that. So you know I think it's really about [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=949.28s)]
*  a legitimizing Israeli violence and also delegitimizing Palestinians right to exist [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=961.12s)]
*  and to take care of each other and to you know provide support for their ill and injured and old [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=972.88s)]
*  and young and you know these kinds of really basic functions that any non-colonized [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=982.88s)]
*  society is able to provide for itself. So yeah I think that that's very much what's going on here. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=991.68s)]
*  It's something that I would draw parallel to is the constant references to Hamas as Iran-backed [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1002.08s)]
*  or Iran-allied. I wrote not too long ago about the use of the word proxy in news media and you know [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1012.5600000000001s)]
*  I suggest that when some political organization is described as a proxy that's meant to [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1023.36s)]
*  delegitimize them right like it's suggesting they're kind of doing the bidding of some outside [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1033.68s)]
*  power and it also delegitimizes the outside power as like meddling in someone else's affairs. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1039.2s)]
*  And so the same kind of processes that work when Hamas is constantly as it has been throughout [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1047.12s)]
*  the recent coverage described as either an Iranian proxy or at least Iran-backed or an Iranian ally [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1053.28s)]
*  that works because of course Iran has been demonized since the 1979 revolution and it's a way of just [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1063.44s)]
*  turning Palestinian resistance into an arm of Iranian malevolence right because there's already [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1073.2800000000002s)]
*  this notion that's been planted and nourished for decades in people's minds that Iran is up to [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1086.0800000000002s)]
*  no good whatever that means like typically it's called supporting terrorism or having some sort of [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1094.8s)]
*  you know dangerous nuclear program or any number of other things along those lines. So yeah linking [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1101.36s)]
*  Hamas which really is in the public consciousness often presented as being kind of shorthand for [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1108.3999999999999s)]
*  being kind of shorthand for all of Palestinians that really makes Israeli violence look [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1116.6399999999999s)]
*  it can make it I should say seem more legitimate more justified. Now they're fighting Iran a [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1125.12s)]
*  you know an actual state right which is a regional power of sorts not to the you know they're not a [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1134.1599999999999s)]
*  nuclear armed power like the Israel and they've been decimated by sanctions and all that [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1141.28s)]
*  but it's a little bit more of a an international conflict between two comparable parties just in [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1145.76s)]
*  terms of the amount of power that they theoretically have as opposed to between colonizer and colonize [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1156.32s)]
*  so it really just is a way of you know muddying what's going on right which is what's happening [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1162.48s)]
*  with so much of this coverage. The goal isn't necessarily always to [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1170.8799999999999s)]
*  you know out and out convince people to see Israel as you know pure and morally righteous [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1176.6399999999999s)]
*  and Palestinians as the opposite certainly that is something we see at times in the coverage [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1186.08s)]
*  but it can be just as effective for the propagandists to just confuse people right and [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1192.1599999999999s)]
*  to just make people throw up their hands and say oh I don't know these are it seems these [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1198.64s)]
*  people have been involved in a religious or cultural clash for thousands of years or [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1204.8000000000002s)]
*  you know whatever that's the main strategy in Britain I think okay I've seen it a little [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1209.5200000000002s)]
*  bit in some of the more right-wing British coverage but I haven't followed it as closely [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1215.6000000000001s)]
*  it certainly comes up here but I recall it too in some guardian coverage of the [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1220.8000000000002s)]
*  of the knives in Tifada a few years ago there was a couple that really that I addressed in my book [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1226.3200000000002s)]
*  that really went for this is a religious conflict so yeah you know that that kind of thing just makes [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1232.72s)]
*  it seem totally timeless right outside of history intractable nothing that can be solved with no [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1241.2s)]
*  clear good and bad with no party more in the right or wrong than the other it's you know whether [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1248.96s)]
*  it's that or whether just talking about clashes and exchanges of fire these things that sort of [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1259.44s)]
*  flatten out the differences and wash over all the details enable people to really or enable [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1266.64s)]
*  make it more likely that people will just not be able to make sense of what's happening which can [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1275.84s)]
*  be just as damaging because it's demobilizing right can be just as damaging as being an [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1280.48s)]
*  you know out and out like hardcore Zionist is if you just if people don't know who's in the right [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1286.1599999999999s)]
*  or who's in the wrong then they're not going to be inclined to want to do anything about it right [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1292.24s)]
*  so yeah I think that that's a really important element of it too just a total obfuscation of [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1297.6799999999998s)]
*  what's of what's happening and what has happened prior to the last 10 days or so [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1305.9199999999998s)]
*  yeah I mean I think it goes across to academia to that whole thing oh it's complicated did you both [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1313.52s)]
*  see this some moron with a PhD on twitter a few days ago oh the middle east expert the scholar [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1322.24s)]
*  with a phd yeah he was like I want to talk about it on the middle east and I'm choosing not to [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1331.28s)]
*  tweet this week maybe you should too it's just like no I'm happy to report that he got widely mocked [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1337.2s)]
*  though yeah well that's also part of the thing is like um you know people people are led to believe [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1344.56s)]
*  that if they don't if they're not a scholar of the middle east if they don't understand [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1353.12s)]
*  you know um the history of the last you know 4 000 years in the middle east if they don't read [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1358.24s)]
*  every scholarly academic book on the history of the palestinians then they're not um they're not [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1366.32s)]
*  supposed to have an opinion uh you know and and that's a that's a way that zionists have for [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1374.32s)]
*  forever and ever um been able to um you know to kind of push down any sort of conversation or [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1379.84s)]
*  you know kind of um distract from from talking about the real issue um is to say oh it's way [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1388.32s)]
*  too complicated you know it's your or or you know if they're israeli or zionist um they'd say well [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1395.12s)]
*  you don't you've never lived there you don't know what it's like um you know so you can't have an [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1403.12s)]
*  opinion on palestinian human rights yeah and the new one is identity politics that's right they say [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1409.04s)]
*  uh you know this offends me or you know you're trampling on my agency or like [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1415.76s)]
*  yeah all this kind of nonsense yeah listen listen to the Israeli voices yeah [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1424.8s)]
*  yeah listen to colonizers right exactly um i was just gonna add and that overlaps with the whole [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1428.48s)]
*  effort to uh which seems to have a bit of a resurgence um to kind of make uh you know israel [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1438.64s)]
*  the indigenous peoples of palestine right that if you can try to sell that point it's a little easier [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1445.3600000000001s)]
*  to do the sort of uh academic identity politics about israeli voices or you know yeah somebody's [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1453.36s)]
*  uh being offended as a zionist or something as though that were right as though zionism was an [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1462.7199999999998s)]
*  identity and not a yeah ideology yeah not a yeah political movement that's a colonia so you know [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1472.0s)]
*  them all for their feelings being hurt [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1479.52s)]
*  um i wanted to to bring in kind of how uh you know both the us and the uk governments are [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1485.04s)]
*  being portrayed as well by by the corporate media you know the us of course being israel's main [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1494.08s)]
*  financier and an aider and a better of israel's crimes um your your colleague and and our friend [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1499.12s)]
*  adam johnson of citations needed and also of fair um tweeted yesterday i love i love it he says i'm [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1507.04s)]
*  absolutely losing my mind biden blocks a un ceasefire resolution four times and lets israel's [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1514.6399999999999s)]
*  leveling of gaza run its course for 11 days without any public condemnation or sanction of any kind [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1520.56s)]
*  and it's spun as an unprecedented tough line bizarro world right so like biden uh considering [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1526.48s)]
*  a 735 million dollar weapons package for boeing weapons made in chicago to go and kill palestinians [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1535.6s)]

*  biden biden's um uh you know mo is being spun as you know really really giving netanyahu a hard [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1552.96s)]
*  time right now and really you know kind of this like this like tough tough guy sort of thing where [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1562.56s)]
*  it's completely just there's no evidence for this um how how is that you know also i think about how [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1568.08s)]
*  obama you know resupplied israel in 2014 while it was bombing the hell out of gaza um and again it [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1576.1599999999999s)]
*  was spun as like you know oh obama's really tough on israel and netanyahu and mobama have all these [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1583.6799999999998s)]
*  tensions between them what is what is that um meant to portray what is what is the what what's [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1588.88s)]
*  the what's the what's the plan there yeah i think uh that's a really important aspect uh to to think [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1597.92s)]
*  about um another weird dimension of it too is saying i've seen a few times and jennifer rubin [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1606.3200000000002s)]
*  in the post did this a few times and she wasn't the only one but yeah or at least a couple of [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1612.72s)]
*  times where it's like um oh uh you know geez biden uh he's really boy it's too bad he got [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1617.2s)]
*  sucked into this situation derailing all of his domestic agenda or you know the trying to rework [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1624.48s)]
*  the deal with iran um you know as though he has no agency in the situation no capacity to say [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1632.56s)]
*  oh i know i'll just basically tell israel not to do it and they won't and it would have never [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1640.8s)]
*  happened in the first place if he had done that um if he threatened to cut off even if he just [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1647.04s)]
*  cut the aid i mean it would be one stroke of a pen of course exactly even even for he probably [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1651.76s)]
*  could get them to do what he wanted if he threatened to cut off a small portion of the aid [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1658.1599999999999s)]
*  um let alone that of course he can and should uh get rid of it entirely so yeah i mean i think [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1662.72s)]
*  that this is a really crucial uh not only to um you know israel palestine but also [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1668.96s)]
*  uh us imperialism generally to constantly position the u.s as either you know an innocent [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1678.72s)]
*  observer or you know working for good right like saying go biden you know he's really worried about [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1687.28s)]
*  um you know rashida tlaib's family or something so he wants to uh you know bring this uh under [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1696.24s)]
*  control as quickly as possible um as though the u.s like as though the u.s is opposed to war right [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1705.28s)]
*  as opposed to the u.s ruling class has any objection uh now or at any point in the past [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1712.72s)]
*  to um you know israel using lethal violence to pursue its aims which generally are also u.s aims [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1720.72s)]
*  um so this uh this process that you described is a matter of obscuring the [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1729.76s)]
*  american responsibility for what's happening so that uh the american which is crucial to keeping [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1738.48s)]
*  the whole operation going right the american public uh if it can if if israel is kind of losing [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1745.04s)]
*  and they perhaps are to some extent the hearts and minds of the american population or at least [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1753.2s)]
*  segments of it uh then uh it's important that they just you know direct that anger at israel in the [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1760.3999999999999s)]
*  abstract and not kind of connect the dots to oh wait there's something that can very easily [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1771.44s)]
*  uh be done living inside the united states in particular but also britain or canada um so [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1777.68s)]
*  you know that's that's really as as we know like uh where people have leverage is people who at [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1785.52s)]
*  least where we have leverage is where we live right whether that's this or any number of other [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1793.2s)]
*  issues and so um if that's if that's gone and we don't recognize that our governments are playing [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1797.44s)]
*  an absolutely central a decisive role in uh this uh in a bloody colonial enterprise then [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1804.48s)]
*  uh that really undermines efforts to uh stop it um and it further legitimizes future is excuse me u.s [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1814.3200000000002s)]
*  um ventures right by by kind of burnishing the image of oh the u.s really is working hard to [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1826.0s)]
*  try to bring at least a ceasefire if not peace to um to palestine um it for palestine israel it can [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1833.68s)]
*  kind of try to re um re reburnish this idea that uh the u.s is like a neutral uh uh you know peace [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1845.0400000000002s)]
*  arbiter of peace and democracy set us up for like the next uh nightmare of pretending that that's [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1858.72s)]
*  gonna do anything to resolve uh the outstanding injustices so yeah i i think it's uh that kind of [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1866.48s)]
*  like yeah laundering uh the u.s role is at least as important as um putting a gloss on what israel [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1875.04s)]
*  has done when it comes to audiences inside the united states and also the other uh powers allied [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1885.2s)]
*  with israel like the place where i live so um yeah i i think that that's something that hasn't gotten [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1892.48s)]
*  enough attention and is really important so i'm glad you brought it up just further to what i was [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1898.96s)]
*  saying earlier about uh the british media i mean it it's very similar dynamics to what you're [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1903.8400000000001s)]
*  describing um there is absolutely there's the people um people on the right wing who are more [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1911.0400000000002s)]
*  gung-ho and a bit more um i don't know exterminate all the brutes kind of uh just pure [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1918.08s)]
*  unvarnished racism um but then you know and a lot of them are zionists as well whether you know [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1927.4399999999998s)]
*  organized zionists um or just generally part of the ideological construction of of empire really [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1935.1999999999998s)]
*  um there are those but by and large it is mostly sort of the oh it's complicated [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1946.32s)]
*  that sort of approach and i think that is part of the colonial heritage as well because the [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1954.56s)]
*  the whole self narrative of the british empire in palestine up until now when it's reflected on is [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1960.3999999999999s)]
*  oh well you know this is this intractable conflict and we try to do good but the empire's narrative [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1966.4799999999998s)]
*  always is really you know we try to do good but the you know the natives insisted on killing each [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1973.36s)]
*  other sort of thing all this kind of we had no choice right yeah so it just it sort of extends [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1978.7199999999998s)]
*  from that but i think i mean to the extent that i've paid much attention to the mainstream media [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1984.6399999999999s)]
*  during this particular onslaught uh which isn't very much to be honest with you uh because it's [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1990.56s)]
*  useless objective study yeah exactly like the same reason that uh i spend a lot of my time looking [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=1997.36s)]
*  at uh what the israel lobby is saying um uh the uh british mainstream media what i've noticed well [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2007.12s)]
*  my impression anyway this time around is they're just reporting on it less like it's like whereas [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2017.36s)]
*  before there would be a bit more i think they kind of know they can't get away with the [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2024.24s)]
*  disinformation so much whether that's conscious or not i'm not i don't not so sure but there just [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2031.44s)]
*  seems to be less reporting on it in general than say the 2014 war that's my impression anyway like [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2037.04s)]
*  i haven't studied that in any substantive way um but they just sort of seem to be not talking [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2044.0s)]
*  about it to a certain extent um because i think they just know there's more general awareness [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2050.56s)]
*  in the british population about palestine compared to 2014 um and uh and criticism and also another [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2056.96s)]
*  factor is um the israeli ambassador in london who is just an outright settler you know yes [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2066.7999999999997s)]
*  fanatic zippy hotevelli um so i think they know she's a bit of a liability [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2076.2400000000002s)]
*  yes do you think that uh on the other hand that part of that if there's a been a [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2082.48s)]
*  relative dip compared to 2014 in the volume of the coverage um do you think that there's uh [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2089.76s)]
*  and anything that that's connected to like hey we already kind of made our point by uh doing corbin [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2097.2000000000003s)]
*  in right that yeah we've already been clear what happens if you get out of line on palestine um so [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2104.56s)]
*  it kind of doesn't matter what the population knows or thinks because within the power structure [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2112.7999999999997s)]
*  uh it's it he's been made an example of he and obviously his entire uh movement you know what [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2119.84s)]
*  um i think that's probably a more credible explanation than what i was saying a minute [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2127.44s)]
*  ago which is uh probably the more optimistic way to look at it but i think both i think both things [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2133.04s)]
*  play play a role but yeah i mean absolutely i mean that that's true that's that's absolutely true [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2140.0s)]
*  yeah they did call bin in and yeah i mean i think there's a certain amount of fear there from [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2145.36s)]
*  mainstream uh journalists um but it's also just cowardice really because like the consequences [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2150.64s)]
*  i mean sky news for example british uh murdoch channel has a got a quite a good correspondent [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2159.2000000000003s)]
*  who's in the west bank at the moment uh mark stone so uh i'm not familiar with i no offense to him [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2165.6800000000003s)]
*  but i'd never heard of him before uh again i don't pay much attention to mainstream media but yeah [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2174.0s)]
*  that people have been circulating clips of his reporting from jerusalem and it's good like he's [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2180.64s)]
*  you know he's just saying what he's seeing and he's sort of challenging the israeli narrative [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2186.3199999999997s)]
*  when it contradicts what he's seeing he's doing his job of course he's getting viciously uh slandered [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2190.3999999999996s)]
*  by um pro israel yeah activists online but uh yeah as part of the course greg finally i want to we only [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2197.2799999999997s)]
*  have a few minutes left i wanted to um ask you if you could kind of give some words of advice to [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2207.52s)]
*  people who still you know watch mainstream media still read the new york times you know i i know [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2217.04s)]
*  that our our parents generation are still you know kind of glued to the msnbc and you know got to go [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2224.56s)]
*  watch rachel now um good you know good meaning well-meaning people but just um channeled [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2231.68s)]
*  you know through this lens of mainstream corporate israel bias what what advice do you have [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2238.96s)]
*  for them about how to be skeptical and what what words or phrases to maybe look out for and dig [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2246.64s)]
*  more into yeah i mean the uh you know the first thing i would honestly just urge someone to to do [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2252.16s)]
*  is that i mean i i don't i don't want to say pay zero attention to it because you can find lots of [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2261.28s)]
*  useful information by reading neutral reports less so so-called neutral reports much less so [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2270.96s)]
*  reading columnists but um what's necessary is to bring a uh framework to that um and that framework [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2277.84s)]
*  is for palestine in my view is the colonial cellar colonial framework and the imperialism [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2288.64s)]
*  framework um and so that is uh the starting point that i would recommend is that you know [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2297.12s)]
*  recognize that there are um longer term trajectories right and that that coexists also [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2306.3199999999997s)]
*  with the fact that palestine is not just uh is not an island right like it's obviously [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2315.7599999999998s)]
*  enmeshed in not only middle eastern but but global politics and so it's important to understand [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2322.08s)]
*  those two things as the jumping off point colonialism and imperialism um you know i think [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2330.56s)]
*  that can enable people to sort of begin to piece together um some some of the information that [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2336.8799999999997s)]
*  is helpful uh that you can sift through i would look for information that comes from more credible [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2344.88s)]
*  institutions that are quoted than just like ambassadors politicians and so forth israeli [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2352.96s)]
*  sources yeah exactly well so yeah i mean part of the problem is sourcing that you almost never see [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2360.0s)]
*  um you know pchr or almazen or al haq or any of the palestinian human rights groups quoted [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2367.36s)]
*  despite the enormous international prestige that a lot of these groups have but um you know even [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2377.2000000000003s)]
*  even like just un sources are going to be a more useful part of what you get in in those uh [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2385.6000000000004s)]
*  articles that you might watch or if they happen to have someone from unra or some other un agency on [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2393.76s)]
*  tv um you know doctors without borders world health a world food program if you ever see [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2400.32s)]
*  comments from these types of groups um that's or or you know batselem batselem or even amnesty [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2408.2400000000002s)]
*  international you know this can like sift through the articles for that for institutions that are [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2416.16s)]
*  imperfect in a lot of cases but um at least get us a lot closer to um having some level of detail [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2423.68s)]
*  that isn't just um he said she said approach which is kind of what the both sidesism is all about um [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2432.96s)]
*  now that's that's part of what i would say then if you're approaching consuming mainstream music [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2441.2s)]
*  media but i think beyond that um it's just good to to not read mainstream music and watch it or [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2446.88s)]
*  to supplement it at bare minimum um i would urge people to read independent media um not all of [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2453.6s)]
*  it's good but electronic edifada and mondo lando weiss and others um in the english speaking world [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2461.6s)]
*  but uh those would be the two two at the forefront um that come to mind anyway they are uh you're [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2469.68s)]
*  gonna get you know actual like professional journalists like yourselves working there who [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2477.68s)]
*  people who talk to sources who quote credible sources um who you know who who research uh their [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2484.16s)]
*  work and refer to reliable institutions of the sorts that i was mentioning uh moments ago which [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2494.3199999999997s)]
*  include like on the ground uh palestinian sources that cannot just be easily dismissed despite [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2502.3199999999997s)]
*  zionist and u.s efforts to dismiss them as just like too biased to be believed or whatever um so [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2509.92s)]
*  you know i think that like people should really try to get past the idea that independent media [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2517.52s)]
*  is uh you know amateurish and just pure ideology and um recognize that [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2525.36s)]
*  you know professional mainstream journalism um is uh is also ideological um professional independent [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2534.4s)]
*  journalism it no doubt has a viewpoint um but that viewpoint is grounded in actual evidence and [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2543.76s)]
*  you can see it right so we triple fact check yeah there you go exactly yeah yeah when i first [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2551.6000000000004s)]
*  and i yeah i know that going through your editing process right some places in actually independent [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2558.8s)]
*  or more mainstream media that i've written for are not very rigorous about it and it's a great [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2566.8s)]
*  safety net as a writer to have that um so yes i can attest that certainly you have no fact checking [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2574.4s)]
*  process which is fantastic so i mean like it's it's it's hard i remember being you know an undergrad [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2581.1200000000003s)]
*  and not kind of uh being where i'm at now politically and thinking like oh i don't know these [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2588.7200000000003s)]
*  i they don't have the prestige of the new york times or so i should stick to the credible ones [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2596.08s)]
*  that the guy in the suit on the subway reads or whatever um that really uh i think it is not going [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2601.92s)]
*  to take people very far and that you can get every bit the same degree of seriousness and honesty [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2611.28s)]
*  on that you can get that you see in the best of professional journalism which is rare you see in [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2619.2799999999997s)]
*  independent media so i mean i really just think you know take take your time to read through it [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2628.48s)]
*  look at the sources being quoted follow the links and if you determine that the independent media [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2634.16s)]
*  source you're looking at is credible then it's much more worthwhile when it comes to [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2640.48s)]
*  palestine and not only palestine to pursue those who are doing the work without uh [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2648.0s)]
*  being kind of lavished uh with money from corporations that stand to gain from [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2655.12s)]
*  bloodshed colonialism and imperialism um from news media outlets that don't have ties to the [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2662.32s)]
*  government they're ostensibly criticizing so you know i think that there's a lot of value to that [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2669.6s)]
*  it doesn't mean that everything in independent media is good or flawless and that everything in [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpNLdCU294A&t=2676.0s)]
