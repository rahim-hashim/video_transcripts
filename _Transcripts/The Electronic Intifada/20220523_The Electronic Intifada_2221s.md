Video Description: On episode 58 of The Electronic Intifada Podcast, we discuss the significance of a recent statement by the editorial board of The Harvard Crimson in support of the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement and Palestinian liberation. 
The Crimson editors say they ‚Äúregret and reject‚Äù their previous position that maligned BDS, and now recognize the potential the movement has for empowering Palestinians to fight against Israeli apartheid ‚Äì especially on campuses.
They also asserted that ‚Äúsupport for Palestinian liberation is not anti-Semitic,‚Äù noting the ‚Äúwake of accusations suggesting otherwise." 
Immediately after the statement was published on 29 April, those exact accusations poured in from Israel‚Äôs defenders, including US politicians and leaders of Israel lobby groups such as the Anti-Defamation League. 
Two members of the Harvard Palestine Solidarity Committee, Nadine Bahour and Shraddha Joshi, join us to talk about the Crimson editorial, along with Emmaia Gelman. Gelman is a lecturer at New York University and an activist with the Drop The ADL coalition. 
She recently wrote an analysis on the dangerous role that the ADL and its CEO, Jonathan Greenblatt, play in emboldening the right wing‚Äôs war against anti-racist activists.
Joshi says that Harvard‚Äôs Palestine Solidarity Committee hadn‚Äôt expected an endorsement from the Crimson given previous years of the newspaper denying or downplaying Israel‚Äôs apartheid practices.
‚ÄúYou can look at a 2000 article that essentially denies apartheid,‚Äù she explains.
‚ÄúAnd then you look at 2020, which says that maybe human rights violations are happening, maybe there are problems that are happening, but it would still be unfair to divest. And then you look at 2022, and they‚Äôre really calling out these issues of apartheid, settler-colonialism, things that ‚Ä¶ PSC members have been calling on for decades.‚Äù
She adds that the shift indicates that PSC‚Äôs actions and impact ‚Äúare not limited to just people who come to our events and people who are very actively part of our community.‚Äù

# How students are fighting ADL's smear campaigns | EI Podcast
**The Electronic Intifada:** [May 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM)
*  The shift is incredible. It shows that what PSD's actions have been about are not limited [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=0.0s)]
*  to just people who come to our events and people who are very actively part of our community. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=15.44s)]
*  This is sort of like a referendum on the way Harvard students are thinking about the issue [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=19.7s)]
*  in general. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=22.88s)]
*  The electronic intifada. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=23.88s)]
*  The electronic intifada. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=24.88s)]
*  The electronic intifada. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=25.88s)]
*  This is the electronic intifada. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=26.88s)]
*  I'm Nora Barrows-Freedman. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=27.88s)]
*  And I'm Asa Winstanley. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=28.88s)]
*  Welcome back to the Electronic Intifada Podcast. I'm Nora Barrows-Freedman. On April 29th, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=29.88s)]
*  the Harvard Crimson's editorial board published a statement in support of boycott, divestment [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=45.96s)]
*  and sanctions and a free Palestine, in which they say that they now quote, regret and reject [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=51.4s)]
*  their previous position that sidelined the Palestinian-led BDS campaign. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=57.04s)]
*  Quote, it is our categorical imperative to side with and empower the vulnerable and oppressed. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=61.96s)]
*  We can't nuance away Palestinians' violent reality, nor can we let our desire for a perfect [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=67.88s)]
*  imaginary tool undermine a living, breathing movement of such great promise. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=74.0s)]
*  They continue, two decades ago, we wrote that divestment was a blunt tool that affected [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  citizens of the target nation equally and should be used sparingly. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=84.67999999999999s)]
*  Yet the tactics embodied by BDS have a historical track record. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=88.92s)]
*  They helped win the liberation of Black South Africans from apartheid and have the potential [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=92.84s)]
*  to do the same for Palestinians today. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=99.16s)]
*  The board also asserted that quote, support for Palestinian liberation is not anti-Semitic, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  noting the quote, wake of accusations suggesting otherwise. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=107.39999999999999s)]
*  And as if on cue, those exact accusations poured in from Israel's defenders of apartheid [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=112.03999999999999s)]
*  from former Harvard president and erstwhile Democratic party official Lawrence Summers [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=118.11999999999999s)]
*  to Israeli newspapers, to US Senator Ted Cruz and the Anti-Defamation League. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=123.63999999999999s)]
*  However, the former president of the Crimson, Daniel Swanson, remarked that it took tremendous [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=129.72s)]
*  courage for the paper to publish the statement. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=135.64s)]
*  He said, quote, there's more debate in the Harvard Crimson editorial and room for both [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=138.2s)]
*  the main editorial and dissent than there is in the New York Times editorial page. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=143.0s)]
*  So that's a very good sign. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=147.48s)]
*  Joining us to talk about the student-led movement that helped lead the Crimson to this point [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=149.88s)]
*  and the backlash by Israel lobby groups and US politicians are two members of the Harvard [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=154.28s)]
*  Palestine Solidarity Committee, Nadine Bahur and Shradda Joshi. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=159.07999999999998s)]
*  And also joining us is Amaya Gelman. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=163.88s)]
*  She's an activist, researcher and a teacher at NYU who just wrote a crucial analysis on [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=165.96s)]
*  the dangerous role that the ADL and its CEO, Jonathan Greenblatt, play in emboldening the [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=171.96s)]
*  right wing's war against anti-racist activists. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=177.64000000000001s)]
*  Amaya is also working on a book about the ADL. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=180.36s)]
*  Thank you all for being with us today on the Electronic Indefada podcast. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=184.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=187.8s)]
*  So, Nadine and Shradda, let's start with having you lay out your reaction to the Harvard Crimson [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=189.4s)]
*  taking this bold stance in support of Palestinian rights and admitting that they got it wrong [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=195.32s)]
*  in the past. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=200.2s)]
*  The editorial board took note of the Palestine Solidarity Committee's campus organizing and [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=201.56s)]
*  they say, quote, in at least one regard, PSC's spirited activism has proven successful. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=206.2s)]
*  It has forced our campus and our editorial board to once again wrestle with what both [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=212.2s)]
*  Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have called Israel's crimes against humanity [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=217.72s)]
*  in the region. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=221.95999999999998s)]
*  Nadine, you're a senior. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=223.32s)]
*  Can you talk about the steady, direct actions you've been a part of at Harvard and the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=225.23999999999998s)]
*  significance of the Crimson recognizing how student organizing led to their statement? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=229.48s)]
*  Thank you for having us, Nuda. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=234.92s)]
*  For the past four years, ever since I started my time at Harvard, I've been very involved with [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=236.92s)]
*  the Palestine Solidarity Committee. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=240.84s)]
*  And as an international student from Palestine, specifically the West Bank, I really wanted to [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=242.76s)]
*  make sure that the lived experiences of Palestinians and that my identity is sort of portrayed [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=247.32s)]
*  during my experience at Harvard. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=251.72s)]
*  And I have the very unique perspective of sharing how I grew up and where I grew up with [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=252.92s)]
*  a population that might not even know where Palestine is. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=257.48s)]
*  And the Palestine Solidarity Committee has always been sort of a home for that kind of [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=260.52s)]
*  activism. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=264.28s)]
*  Ever since my first year, we were able to organize our annual Israeli Apartheid Week, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=265.32s)]
*  which is sort of what spurred the editorial this year. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=269.24s)]
*  But alongside that, we also host a variety of speakers. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=273.64s)]
*  We host a Palestine 101 event. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=277.24s)]
*  We organized rallies in support of our Die Best campaign. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=280.03999999999996s)]
*  We organized boycotts for different products that the university supplies that support [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=283.56s)]
*  Israeli apartheid, like Sabra Hamazon in our dining halls. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=289.15999999999997s)]
*  But we also want to highlight the culture that comes with Palestine that's also very often a [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=292.68s)]
*  part of what is being stolen and what is a part of Israeli apartheid. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=297.56s)]
*  But we host a lot of dupk√© events, traditional Palestinian dance. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=301.64s)]
*  We try to do an embroidery workshop. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=305.79999999999995s)]
*  We try to highlight Palestinian food. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=308.44000000000005s)]
*  And I think throughout my four years, half of it was online for sure. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=310.12s)]
*  But the Palestine Solidarity Committee's events continued to sort of be a main part of my [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=313.48s)]
*  experience and something that we really wanted to make sure is portrayed on campus. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=319.88000000000005s)]
*  But of course, with every year, we try to highlight something different. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=324.44000000000005s)]
*  There's always something happening. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=327.48s)]
*  The news never leaves us looking for information or for anything to highlight. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=328.92s)]
*  And every year, we sort of try to highlight a different thing through our Israeli apartheid [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=334.2s)]
*  week. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=338.44s)]
*  And I think during my first year, there was a big emphasis on solidarity movements. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=338.6s)]
*  During online year with COVID, there was a lot to emphasize in terms of the pandemic, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=343.08s)]
*  but also in terms of the violence that was taking place in May 2021 and throughout the summer. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=348.04s)]
*  And this year, we really wanted to focus on BDS, on Die Vestment. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=353.16s)]
*  We wanted to put all our efforts into our Die Vestment campaign, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=356.68s)]
*  which we titled Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=360.68s)]
*  And we really organized throughout the year for it. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=364.28000000000003s)]
*  And IAW was sort of the icing on the cake for that in terms of really bringing speakers that [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=367.32s)]
*  highlight the apartheid that is on the ground, but also how Harvard is complicit in it. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=372.36s)]
*  And that really put the Crimson's editorial into perspective when it came out just a week after [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=378.28000000000003s)]
*  IAW because we had been organizing for so long. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=384.04s)]
*  We had been highlighting BDS for so long. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=387.0s)]
*  And I think as a Palestinian student, I often felt that our voices were really marginalized, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=389.8s)]
*  really just ignored by the Crimson. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=394.2s)]
*  And many times the Crimson was sort of one of the forces that was working against PSC [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=396.2s)]
*  and was one of the forces that didn't allow us to publish anonymously, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=401.48s)]
*  would cover our events in a very, quote unquote, neutral manner. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=405.0s)]
*  And we really sort of get slapped with the anti-Semitic label very quickly just for hosting [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=410.84000000000003s)]
*  certain speakers. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=416.52s)]
*  So I was very shocked when I saw the Crimson's editorial that morning. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=417.88s)]
*  And I couldn't believe that the same body that only two years ago had said that the BDS movement [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=421.64s)]
*  is a blunt tool and something that they are not willing to back by a long shot in two years, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=427.32s)]
*  saw PSC's activities, saw the students, heard the students' voices on campus, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=434.68s)]
*  and decided to take a stance. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=438.84s)]
*  And the backlash that they're facing now is nothing new to PSC. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=441.0s)]
*  What's interesting is I have been focusing so much on my shock that the editorial came out [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=445.08s)]
*  and how excited I am about it. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=448.91999999999996s)]
*  And I've really sidelined a lot of the backlash, similar to a lot of PSC organizers, I think. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=450.28s)]
*  But then when you open any of the news or you talk to anyone in the Crimson right now, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=454.84s)]
*  they're like, but the backlash and it's so much. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=457.71999999999997s)]
*  And how do you deal with that? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=459.96s)]
*  And for some reason, I feel like I've only now started to notice how much we've normalized that. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=461.4s)]
*  We sort of know what we're working toward. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=466.2s)]
*  Then we're going to keep putting our efforts into producing more events and into sort of [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=467.96s)]
*  highlighting our mission rather than putting our efforts into finding any of the backlash [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=471.88s)]
*  that's coming out and sort of the repeated accusations of X, Y, and Z of what we're doing. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=475.96s)]
*  But it really does highlight to the rest of the Harvard community [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=482.36s)]
*  sort of what it feels like and how it is to organize for Palestine. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=485.64s)]
*  And that backlash is definitely something that needs to be kept in mind. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=489.56s)]
*  Thanks, Nadine. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=493.96s)]
*  Shada, how important is it that a campus newspaper like the Crimson takes a stand [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=495.24s)]
*  in support of BDS? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=501.24s)]
*  And what does the signal in terms of changing the paradigm on college campuses, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=502.28000000000003s)]
*  especially high profile ones like Harvard, which as we know and as Nadine pointed out, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=507.40000000000003s)]
*  has relationships with Israeli institutions? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=512.12s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=517.32s)]
*  I think just to echo Nadine, after IAW was over this week, we were really proud about [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=517.88s)]
*  everything that had gone down. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=523.0s)]
*  But I don't think anyone really expected that it would be recognized in such a way, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=524.04s)]
*  especially because just after IAW, the direct article that was written by the Crimson was [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=527.64s)]
*  something along the lines of Israeli apartheid week draws backlash. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=532.68s)]
*  And that was sort of the headline. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=535.64s)]
*  And that was what was on the front page of the Crimson. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=536.84s)]
*  And so a week later for this editorial to come out was really shocking and in all pleasant ways, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=539.08s)]
*  really surprising for us because we hadn't expected such an endorsement. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=544.28s)]
*  Just given the years of precedent, you can look at a 2000 article, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=547.88s)]
*  your 2000 article that essentially denies apartheid. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=551.08s)]
*  And then you look at 2020, which says that maybe human rights violations are happening, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=553.5600000000001s)]
*  maybe there are problems that are happening, but it would still be unfair to divest. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=559.0s)]
*  And then you look at 2022 and they're really calling out these issues of apartheid, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=562.76s)]
*  settler colonialism, things that we've been calling on and things that PSC members have [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=567.4s)]
*  been calling on for decades. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=571.16s)]
*  And so I think that the shift is incredible. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=572.36s)]
*  It shows that what PSC's actions have been about are not limited to just people who come [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=575.08s)]
*  to our events and people who are very actively part of our community. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=579.88s)]
*  But rather, I think for a lot of us, this is sort of like a referendum on the way Harvard [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=583.08s)]
*  students are thinking about the issue in general. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=587.48s)]
*  And so I think for me personally, as someone who's not Palestinian, who has, who's part of a lot of [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=589.48s)]
*  communities that aren't really engaged with the cause, to see these conversations sort of [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=593.88s)]
*  happening outside of our spaces, outside of organizing spaces is a validation. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=597.64s)]
*  And I think that the Crimson editorial has brought those conversations into the mainstream. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=601.88s)]
*  And so then looking at that, looking at Harvard in relationship to other universities, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=606.2s)]
*  obviously the fact that the Crimson was the one that endorsed this has just, the big name of the [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=610.28s)]
*  Crimson has drawn so much attention from outside of Harvard, whether that's good attention from [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=614.4399999999999s)]
*  people like Mohammed Al-Kurd, Noura Al-Aqqas, people who are really engaged in these causes and [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=619.3199999999999s)]
*  are sort of at the front line of this type of advocacy. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=623.88s)]
*  And then obviously the backlash from Zionist media, from politicians and stuff. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=627.0799999999999s)]
*  But I think the fact that the Crimson has given this endorsement shows that something big is [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=631.72s)]
*  happening and that it's not just limited to PSC, to PSC at Harvard, but maybe more just students [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=635.96s)]
*  in general, campus life, campus organizers in general across the country who are bringing [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=641.88s)]
*  attention to these issues and gaining traction. And I think it's really a testament to the fact [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=647.1600000000001s)]
*  that young people are changing the way they think about Palestine. And I hope that the Crimson [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=651.5600000000001s)]
*  editorial will inspire other universities to sort of continue their dialogue about what's going on [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=656.6s)]
*  in Palestine and how that can be addressed on campus. And specifically to Harvard, I hope [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=661.4000000000001s)]
*  that this can be the starting point for us to reevaluate our relationship with occupation and [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=665.72s)]
*  for the administration to sort of take the pressure from students and look at what can [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=669.88s)]
*  be done in response. Thanks so much. Let's talk a little bit about the backlash and then I want to [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=674.0400000000001s)]
*  bring Amaya into the conversation as well. Nadine, tell us about the level of vilification [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=681.5600000000001s)]
*  of the Harvard Crimson statement, what kind of backlash the editorial board and PSC has been [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=688.0400000000001s)]
*  facing and what that looks like. The backlash has been sort of, at least from my perspective, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=694.68s)]
*  very similar to a lot of the things that we've seen. I think we now live in a world where [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=700.76s)]
*  everything is happening on Instagram, on Twitter, on podcasts, but so much of it is always at your [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=704.4399999999999s)]
*  fingertips at any hour of the day. And I think there's always been a lot of backlash that has [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=710.68s)]
*  happened towards PSC social media and towards PSC as an institution. But what is always so much [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=716.1999999999999s)]
*  more disheartening to see is the backlash that students face personally. And I think as much as [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=721.64s)]
*  I don't like to say this, but I've gotten more used to it, or at least I see it coming, like you [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=727.16s)]
*  said, it's like as if it comes on cue and you know that it's coming and you accept the fact that you [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=732.12s)]
*  have to deal with it. And as much as this shouldn't be the case, I think PSC members have been doing [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=737.08s)]
*  this for four years and it's become a little bit more expected. But I think the backlash of the [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=742.12s)]
*  Crimson editorial members and the Crimson as a whole with all its members and its president is [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=747.32s)]
*  facing has been absolutely horrendous. For beginners, the students didn't think that [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=751.88s)]
*  you write under the Crimson editorial board's name because this is an anonymous group of [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=759.48s)]
*  sort of students that can do it and they get to publish under the editorial's name. But that [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=764.5200000000001s)]
*  security that you get that when you publish about anything else under the editorial's name [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=768.84s)]
*  immediately goes away with Palestine. I remember the second day or the third day after the editorial [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=772.2800000000001s)]
*  came out, there was this Instagram page of someone just taking screenshots of everyone's personal [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=776.6s)]
*  accounts, everyone's social media and exposing them and saying truly horrific things about them. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=781.64s)]
*  And so many of these people were not even involved in that editorial. They're just a part of the [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=786.9200000000001s)]
*  Crimson, which is a huge organization and it's the largest newspaper in college campuses. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=790.9200000000001s)]
*  And I think that vilification and that personal targeting is just another example of how Zionists, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=797.64s)]
*  of how any backlash that organizing for Palestine faces is not usually coming for the ideology as [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=804.76s)]
*  much as it's coming for the people, for wanting to push you out of this doing this work. And it's [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=810.12s)]
*  absolutely scary and I think it doesn't matter even as someone who expects it every time I publish [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=815.3199999999999s)]
*  something under my name. I see some of the comments, I see some of the articles that I read and I'm like [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=820.36s)]
*  do I really want to keep doing this? Is this going to be my whole life? And I think it's really hard [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=825.16s)]
*  to come to terms with that when you're still finding your identity and when you're still [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=830.4399999999999s)]
*  finding your footing in college. We might be 20 plus years old but I think it's still really hard [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=833.24s)]
*  to figure out where you, how you want to sort of figure out your relationship with politics and [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=837.96s)]
*  sort of with being publicly like a face and figure. I think that's one part of it. I think the other [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=842.04s)]
*  part of it, especially for PSC members who want to voice their opinion, who want to stand in support [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=847.08s)]
*  of the Crimson and who want to publish more op-eds in the Crimson speaking against the backlash are [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=850.92s)]
*  just unable to do so because they can't have their name out there because they either want to go back [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=857.16s)]
*  home over the summer or they are on a student visa in the U.S. and can't risk that because they [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=861.56s)]
*  want to continue their education. And I think that really always just makes you look at everything [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=866.4399999999999s)]
*  from a bird's eye perspective and realize the privilege that Zionists have in terms of speaking [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=872.52s)]
*  loudly and proudly and the power that those voices have, whereas the press voices that do want to [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=877.3199999999999s)]
*  speak up in solidarity of Palestinians and in solidarity with the Crimson are just unable to [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=882.52s)]
*  do so. And I think that's sort of from a bigger perspective on Harvard's campus in specific and [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=888.04s)]
*  in terms of the backlash that students are facing. It's always, I think specifically this year, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=892.5999999999999s)]
*  been so much more clear how institutionally backed this backlash is from Harvard, from prominent, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=898.12s)]
*  loud and very powerful voices on campus, and how we're at the end of the day a student organization [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=904.68s)]
*  and we're just a group of students that are passionate about one thing and want to call for [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=910.76s)]
*  sort of the liberation of Palestine and we're faced by people on Harvard's payroll that are [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=914.92s)]
*  telling us that what you're doing is problematic and you're alienating students and you are calling [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=920.44s)]
*  for X, Y and Z and things that are just not even worth repeating on a space like this. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=926.36s)]
*  I think it really puts into perspective how the power imbalance that exists between Palestinian [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=932.92s)]
*  student organizers and everyone else in the Harvard sphere, which echoes I think most of [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=937.5600000000001s)]
*  the college campuses in the US, is absolutely very challenging to deal with and very unbalanced. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=944.4399999999999s)]
*  And I think that backlash will continue to come even now as we respond to the editorial and as [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=952.04s)]
*  we try to share more of our perspective. But I think one thing that we always talk about in PSC [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=958.28s)]
*  is that it doesn't matter how much of this backlash comes, it doesn't matter how many [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=962.68s)]
*  editorials are written and how many Instagram accounts and comments and whatever you want [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=965.8s)]
*  comes towards PSC. I think we've managed to figure out that the answer to all of this is [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=971.0s)]
*  just to channel into speaking louder and to organizing more events and to holding IAW again [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=976.76s)]
*  and into writing more and that's the most constructive way to do it and the way that [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=981.72s)]
*  we'll continue doing it. Thanks Nadine. Amaya, you've been tracking the kinds of backlash [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=985.8s)]
*  Nadine and Sharada were just talking about by Israel lobby groups and the Israeli government [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=993.24s)]
*  itself and one particular lobby group working tirelessly to denounce student activism in [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=998.6s)]
*  support of Palestinian rights has been the ADL, a right-wing lobby organization masquerading as a [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1004.6s)]
*  civil rights group. Its CEO Jonathan Greenblatt has been on a tirade recently trying to smear [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1010.76s)]
*  anti-Zionist activists, anti-racist organizers as racists. And as you've pointed out over the [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1017.16s)]
*  last several years, this is not a new tactic obviously but his recent actions are becoming [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1025.48s)]
*  increasingly dangerous as you point out in your latest post on Medium. He said of the Crimson [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1031.08s)]
*  editorial that it is outrageous to equate Zionism with white supremacy and that the editors show no [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1037.8799999999999s)]
*  understanding of the region's past or present. You're writing a book on the ADL. What are your [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1043.6399999999999s)]
*  initial thoughts on that group's smear campaign against the Crimson editors and against students [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1050.68s)]
*  like Nadine and Sharada? Well the day before, I think the day before the Crimson editorial, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1058.28s)]
*  on May 1st the CEO of the ADL, Jonathan Greenblatt, conducted a national meeting, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1066.52s)]
*  sort of a pre-hyped national meeting, where he announced that he was going after student groups [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1076.04s)]
*  including Students for Justice in Palestine and also a few other organizations, Jewish Voice for [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1081.0s)]
*  Peace and CARE, and also dropped the ADL which is a coalition of anti-racist organizations. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1087.24s)]
*  And that he was announcing that the ADL was essentially going to war with organizations [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1094.2s)]
*  that challenge Zionism and that he was sort of walking away, the ADL was walking away [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1102.12s)]
*  from previous claims that it was allied with anti-racist movements. In fact, one or two years [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1112.1999999999998s)]
*  ago the ADL joined in a letter that had been organized where several hundred Jewish organizations [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1120.12s)]
*  signed on to identify Black Lives Matter as a new civil rights movement, which was kind of a [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1126.92s)]
*  walk back of a previous round of attacks on Black Lives Matter for making common cause and identifying [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1132.6000000000001s)]
*  solidarity with Palestinians against racist policing. So there had been a sort of an effort [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1141.4s)]
*  by the ADL and not just the ADL but major Zionist institutions more generally to try and [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1147.88s)]
*  to try and make some common cause with anti-racist movement groups as Black Lives Matter and [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1157.4s)]
*  anti-policing protests became the sort of core of civil rights politics in the U.S. And as they [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1164.28s)]
*  increasingly helped people understand the connections between racism in the U.S. and Israeli [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1172.52s)]
*  racism, Israeli apartheid, and Palestinian like discussions of what was happening and how [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1179.4s)]
*  it was related. And that all went away. That on May 1st it was gone. That was the mask was off. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1186.84s)]
*  Jonathan Greenblatt announced very specifically that he was that he was doing that, that he was [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1193.56s)]
*  characterizing anti-Zionism as anti-Semitism without exception. And that he named these [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1199.8799999999999s)]
*  three primary organizations and dropped the ADL as a coalition. And he did it in language [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1207.9599999999998s)]
*  that's Cold War language. It was really, I mean, it was kind of funny but not funny. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1213.48s)]
*  He called the idea that anti-Zionism was a challenge to state violence, Soviet disinformation, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1219.0s)]
*  really echoing the words of the Christian right as it challenges critical race theory, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1227.16s)]
*  supposedly critical race theory and education, calling critical race theory and teaching about [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1232.8400000000001s)]
*  race a Marxist plot and socialist plot. So that was the day before the Crimson editorial. And so [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1237.72s)]
*  it was not a surprise when his next move, when the ADL's next move was to smear the Crimson [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1245.56s)]
*  and to call the editorial sort of childish. And I can't remember what he said exactly. He called [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1254.3600000000001s)]
*  it, he said it was like wrong and didn't understand. And that's been the ADL's approach [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1260.28s)]
*  generally to when anti-racist statements come out, when organizations or movement groups come [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1264.6000000000001s)]
*  out to say, like, look, we have to take a stand on BDS or on Palestinian liberation, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1276.44s)]
*  not necessarily specifically to Palestinians, but because we have to oppose racism and colonialism [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1281.32s)]
*  and state violence. The ADL's response is sit down children, you don't know what you're talking about, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1286.8400000000001s)]
*  or you're evil and you're anti-Semites, but the effect is the same. It's not new. The ADL has [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1293.8s)]
*  been attacking the left for a long time and it's been attacking civil rights, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1302.84s)]
*  civil rights groups for a long time, even as it purports to be a civil rights organization. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1310.52s)]
*  But the thing that's really interesting about this moment and that I think that we're seeing [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1316.36s)]
*  in the way that the Crimson's editorial shows a shift is that the whole conversation about [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1321.64s)]
*  race and rights in the US has changed because of Black Lives Matter and the sort of popularization [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1331.3200000000002s)]
*  of ideas like structural racism and colonialism. The ADL has had to, and again, also Zionist [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1337.88s)]
*  organizations more broadly and especially those who are trying to target millennials, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1347.16s)]
*  have turned to this language about Jews are indigenous to Palestine and Jews are not white [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1352.6000000000001s)]
*  and Jews must be included in your, if you are anti-racist and you're saying that Jews are white, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1359.88s)]
*  you're a racist, then this doesn't make sense. So it's trying to sort of insert Zionism into [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1365.4s)]
*  the new anti-racist politics and it fails on its face. And so then I think what that has done is [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1371.4s)]
*  it has made space for people who didn't previously understand why BDS was important or why the ADL [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1379.16s)]
*  was wrong to question them. So I think the ADL is in a terrible position right now, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1387.96s)]
*  trying to enter into that civil rights space at the same time as Zionism is becoming more and more [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1395.24s)]
*  a pet of white supremacists. It's just not working. So I think the backlash was not a surprise, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1404.76s)]
*  but also I think the PSC approach that we're hearing from Sharda and Nadine is absolutely, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1413.0s)]
*  like it makes total sense, like just keep going because the ADL's messaging is just, it's falling [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1418.28s)]
*  flatter and flatter and they're losing more and more of their audience. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1424.36s)]
*  You also write in your piece that it's not only wrong on its face as you say, but that it's also [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1430.4399999999998s)]
*  seriously dangerous that the ADL's giving a pass to right-wing, racist, anti-Palestinian organizations [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1439.32s)]
*  will have really, really pernicious, dangerous effects. Can you talk a little bit about that [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1451.72s)]
*  and how you see the ADL's war on anti-racist now playing out? [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1458.3600000000001s)]
*  Yes, the ADL has a long history as an anti-communist and a Cold War organization. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1468.1200000000001s)]
*  And that sounds a little dated and irrelevant maybe, but the nature of US politics right now [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1476.2s)]
*  and the way that white nationalism is defining itself is actually in terms of the Cold War. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1484.1200000000001s)]
*  It's weird, but it's true. So the Cold War frame of mind is like the United States and the West [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1490.2s)]
*  against the scary East. Anti-communism translates very well into Islamophobia [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1499.48s)]
*  because there's the idea of the United States is it's capitalist and there's a whiteness to it [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1507.4s)]
*  and a Christianity and it's pitted against this sort of foreign, scary, not Christian, [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1513.5600000000002s)]
*  not capitalist East. And that's the core of white nationalism. And even though the ADL [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1522.2s)]
*  in his speech Greenblatt compared anti-Zionism to QAnon, right? So he was trying to make out that [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1531.88s)]
*  it's racist. He was trying to play into a trope, but in fact his base is probably closer to QAnon [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1540.76s)]
*  than anything. We know that Christian Zionists have a very close overlap with QAnon. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1548.28s)]
*  We know that the ADL is busily fighting, leading the fight against ethnic studies in California [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1555.8799999999999s)]
*  and spreading that fight elsewhere across the country. That fight, the people who are [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1563.56s)]
*  opposing ethnic studies in California are opposing it on the grounds that it's critical race theory [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1568.6799999999998s)]
*  and Marxist, right? So these are the idea of calling anti-racism Soviet disinformation or [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1573.32s)]
*  calling anti-Zionism Marxist is a way of signaling that the ADL is sort of giving permission or [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1581.0s)]
*  dog whistling to white nationalist organizations that it's okay and desirable to target anti-racist [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1592.6s)]
*  movement groups. And we know that white nationalists are armed. We know that not just [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1601.72s)]
*  white nationalists, but also that Zionist nationalists and historically the Jewish [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1607.08s)]
*  Defense League are armed, that they're not interested in U.S. law because they view [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1613.8s)]
*  themselves as accountable to a higher authority, right? This is dangerous. They're inviting and [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1618.76s)]
*  in some ways inciting violence. Now I want to be really careful about what I'm saying. I'm not [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1625.08s)]
*  saying that Greenblatt said go out and harm somebody, but historically the organizations [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1629.56s)]
*  that the ADL has demonized have then become the targets of people who have done bombings and [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1635.1599999999999s)]
*  murders. So yeah, I'm legitimately terrified and I opened my mailbox slowly. I'm not kidding. Like [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1643.1599999999999s)]
*  it's incredibly dangerous. Thanks for that. We only have a few minutes left. Nadine and [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1651.24s)]
*  Shraddha, how does this level of outright targeting of anti-Zionist, anti-racist organizers on [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1659.4s)]
*  campuses from Harvard to Berkeley affect students and how can they and you as members of PSC be [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1666.1200000000001s)]
*  empowered to fight back? What's your next steps here? So I think like one of the conversations [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1676.2s)]
*  we've been having a lot is when we say fighting back, like who is our audience? Like who's the [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1682.0400000000002s)]
*  audience of our activism? Who do we direct our energy and our efforts towards? And I think one [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1685.72s)]
*  thing that we've sort of come to realize is that we're not necessarily trying to respond to the [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1690.3600000000001s)]
*  alumni who are going to send letters to the Crimson saying things that are racist, saying [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1694.6000000000001s)]
*  things that are sort of denying Palestinian suffering that are just so oblivious to what's [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1699.16s)]
*  going on on the ground. Because in the end, we really do want to capitalize on this movement, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1702.68s)]
*  which is that students are having these conversations and that students are starting [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1706.6000000000001s)]
*  to listen and realize that there is a connection between Black Lives Matter and between what's [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1709.88s)]
*  going on in Palestine and that we as Harvard students, as a lot of us as Americans, are [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1714.44s)]
*  directly complicit in this type of oppression. And so I think trying to focus on solidarity building [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1719.0800000000002s)]
*  and to have that at the student level is something that we can do a lot more tangibly and something [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1724.1200000000001s)]
*  that we can do a lot more effectively because as we talked about, the backlash and the people that [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1729.16s)]
*  we're up against are in places of power, considerable power more than us. And so while we can, you know, [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1733.16s)]
*  look at the Crimson op-eds or look at people who have been tweeting about us in the end, I think [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1738.3600000000001s)]
*  that it's a lot better and just a lot more effective for us to put our efforts into what's [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1742.52s)]
*  going on on the ground. And I think something that's almost heartening is the fact that, so last year [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1746.52s)]
*  in wake of everything that happened in May 2021, there was a Harvard Stands with Israel petition. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1751.56s)]
*  But if you look at the majority of the names, a lot of them were alumni and more than, there are [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1756.6s)]
*  definitely a lot more alumni than Harvard students. And so while obviously that means that there are [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1760.68s)]
*  people in positions of power who have that viewpoint, it also means that younger people [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1765.16s)]
*  aren't espousing those viewpoints and that people who are vocal about, you know, opposing [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1769.96s)]
*  the Crimson editorial, a lot of them are people who graduated from Harvard 20, 30 years ago and [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1774.52s)]
*  are really not connected to the reality of student activism and to what's going on on campus now. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1779.16s)]
*  And so while we will always be getting hatred and getting, you know, these sorts of slander and a [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1784.2s)]
*  lot of pushback from people who are extremely Zionist and just don't hold the, even the space [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1789.64s)]
*  to sort of have this conversation and have this dialogue, I think we should be dedicating our [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1795.48s)]
*  attention towards the majority who might be unengaged or might be sort of on the fence, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1799.24s)]
*  say that things are complicated and to show them that, you know, it's not complicated. Here's what [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1803.56s)]
*  Palestinians are saying, here's the evidence, here's what human rights organizations are saying. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1807.32s)]
*  And I think having that standpoint has been a lot more effective and that's probably what's led to [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1811.0s)]
*  this moment, this just watershed moment of the Crimson editorial. And that's also why it's just [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1814.92s)]
*  the beginning and why we want to continue bringing this conversation to students rather than, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1820.1200000000001s)]
*  you know, worrying too much about what others are saying from positions of power. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1824.6s)]
*  Nadine, did you want to add to that? [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1830.2s)]
*  I completely agree with all of this. I think the emphasis that I would add is on the point of [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1832.92s)]
*  the students, the current population at Harvard and their current viewpoints. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1838.1200000000001s)]
*  I think it's even much faster turnover than you might imagine. I think during my four years here, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1842.28s)]
*  the conversations I used to have with people my first year are nowhere near the conversations [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1848.2s)]
*  I'm having now three and a half years later. And I think that speed at which students are [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1852.04s)]
*  willing to listen to others at the speed at which students are willing to act and show that BDS [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1858.04s)]
*  could work. I think there's this trip that's funded by the Harvard Hilaal over spring break [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1862.28s)]
*  to Israel, it's like 10 days of a free trip that's open to anyone and everyone in the Harvard [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1866.28s)]
*  population. And we started a boycott campaign this year. And we also launched a boycott campaign two [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1870.28s)]
*  years ago when we were in person. And that year, no one sort of would talk to us, no one would sit [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1875.1599999999999s)]
*  with us at the table to like listen to our perspective and no one boycotted. And this year, [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1879.24s)]
*  five students boycotted. And they showed you that BDS has the potential to work. Five out of a [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1882.84s)]
*  hundred might not be a lot, but five is way more than zero. And I think it's really important to [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1887.32s)]
*  put into perspective the students that are listening to other activists on campus and the [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1892.9199999999998s)]
*  students that are willing to listen to student experiences and lived experiences of Palestinians [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1896.6799999999998s)]
*  and to really center those Palestinian voices. I think the whole argument that you need to go [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1900.6s)]
*  Steve is injustice in order to believe it and order to confirm that everything you're reading [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1904.9199999999998s)]
*  about in the news is real. And then you're going to take a stance is very quickly losing its footing. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1908.9199999999998s)]
*  And as people are very quickly starting to listen to Palestinian students. And I think we need to [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1914.36s)]
*  also center the fact that Harvard needs to invite more Palestinian professors, more Palestinians [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1918.84s)]
*  callers, accept people into their community that are willing to share that perspective. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1922.84s)]
*  And they've done a decent job so far, given that I'm here. I think I have to say that, [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1927.8799999999999s)]
*  but I think there's a lot of room for a lot of teaching to be given from a different perspective, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1932.76s)]
*  rather than only accepting students because student activism is very important and very critical. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1937.4799999999998s)]
*  But like we were saying, it's always met with institutional backed opposition and that shift [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1942.76s)]
*  needs to happen very quickly. And I think one more thing I'd add is that since we are very much tied [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1948.52s)]
*  to the BDS campaign, everything that we do comes from a precedent. And, you know, in the 1980s, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1953.8s)]
*  1990s, there was a lot of activism around apartheid South Africa. And that was met with incredible [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1957.96s)]
*  institutional backlash, but there was also faculty support and there's also rising student support. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1963.16s)]
*  And so I think if we can use that to sort of guide our activism now, which is what we do [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1968.2s)]
*  always strive to do, I feel like we are moving in a positive direction because we've gotten a [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1971.8s)]
*  lot of student support. There are faculty who are really excited about this editorial and who are [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1976.12s)]
*  willing to stand with us. And I just can't imagine how this will just kind of keep increasing throughout [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1979.96s)]
*  the years. Thank you, Shradha and Nadine. And Amaya, did you have anything else you'd like to [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1984.28s)]
*  say about the current moment that we find ourselves in right now? Yeah, I just, I want to just pick up [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1992.36s)]
*  on this sort of dichotomy that Nadine and Shradha are talking about where there's, on the one hand, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=1997.8s)]
*  there's these sort of incredible gains in understanding of Palestinian struggle and what's [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=2003.08s)]
*  going on. And on the other hand, this increasing repression from institutions of power. And that's [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=2009.32s)]
*  the case with the ADL as well. So on the one hand, the ADL is losing its credibility, it's losing its [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=2015.48s)]
*  base. And on the other hand, it's actually been really successful in using the language of hate [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=2019.72s)]
*  and stopping hate. And it's cooking the books on discussing anti-Semitism, which as we know, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=2025.88s)]
*  like stats of anti-Semitism sort of role in any criticism of Israel and imply that actually, [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=2033.8000000000002s)]
*  that those incidents are incidents that put you in danger, which we know is not true. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=2039.8000000000002s)]
*  And they've been really successful in using that to increase their institutional power. So even as [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=2044.6000000000001s)]
*  they lose their base, they're increasing their institutional power. And one piece of evidence [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=2052.68s)]
*  of that is the fact that Deborah Lipstadt was just confirmed as the US anti-Semitism [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=2056.6s)]
*  czar, envoy, whatever her official title is, which is quite a powerful position with no [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=2061.7999999999997s)]
*  accountability. And the one of the things that Greenblatt promised in his speech on May 1st was [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=2068.3599999999997s)]
*  that basically he was going to be engaging in lawfare against student groups. And so to have lawfare [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=2074.3599999999997s)]
*  up their sleeve and to have a very powerful voice in the US government, to have media still consuming [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=2081.56s)]
*  these statistics on anti-Semitism as if they're truth with really no investigation of what they [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=2088.9199999999996s)]
*  actually mean. And when I say the ADL, I actually mean a sort of much larger ecology of organizations. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=2094.9199999999996s)]
*  I'm not just talking about the ADL, is actually in quite an institutionally powerful position. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=2102.6s)]
*  And so building the base of opposition at the popular level just becomes so incredibly important [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=2106.92s)]
*  and supporting the work of students and supporting their resistance, like putting money into the [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=2113.88s)]
*  fighting of the lawsuits, which will definitely have to happen, just is incredibly, incredibly [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=2119.4s)]
*  important because we're in this pivotal moment. So I really want to just like big up the work of [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=2124.28s)]
*  the students. And also just a pitch, if anybody wants to look at this, I'm going to put it in the [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=2128.2000000000003s)]
*  adl.org. If anybody wants to look at the materials and drop the adl.org that is also available. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZXOr2ProyM&t=2135.08s)]
