# Will Visa Waiver Program allow Israel to keep racist entry policies? | EI Podcast
**The Electronic Intifada:** [August 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ)
*  What the memo laid out and the way this is going to be implemented if they are approved [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=0.0s)]
*  is basically creating different classes of U.S. citizens and the U.S. government signing [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=13.84s)]
*  off on that and essentially signing off on Israel's system of apartheid. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=18.68s)]
*  Welcome back to the Electronic Intifada Podcast. I'm Nora Barrows-Freedman. We've got some [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=24.96s)]
*  exciting updates to the podcast coming up in the next few weeks, so stay tuned. But [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=44.72s)]
*  today we're taking a look at the U.S. visa waiver program and what the status of Israel's [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=49.64s)]
*  admission to the program means, especially for Palestinian Americans. As we reported in June, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=55.04s)]
*  65 members of the U.S. Senate sent a letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=61.32s)]
*  of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas urging them to, quote, include Israel in the visa waiver [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=67.68s)]
*  program and to encourage both the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security to [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=73.88s)]
*  prioritize finalizing Israel's accession this year. The senators hope that if Israel hits certain [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=79.6s)]
*  benchmarks, particularly with Palestinian American travelers, that the apartheid state can join the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=85.8s)]
*  select program and some 450,000 annual Israeli travelers will no longer have to secure a visa [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  to travel to the U.S. Visitors would then be able to make 90-day tourist and business visits [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=98.8s)]
*  without a visa. Palestinians fear that the fulfillment of those benchmarks will be a [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=105.84s)]
*  temporary phenomenon and Palestinian Americans and Muslim American travelers will quickly face [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=110.8s)]
*  discrimination once again. There are profound doubts that, quote, snapback provisions would [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=117.0s)]
*  actually be applied to Israel. The senators' letter overlapped with Palestinian Americans [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=122.28s)]
*  huddling in relatives' homes as settlers with complicit Israeli soldiers put Palestinian [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=127.72s)]
*  property to the torch. As our colleague Michael Brown wrote, quote, the letter's timing was [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=132.84s)]
*  shameless. Approval of the visa waiver program by the September 30th deadline would have practical [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=138.36s)]
*  implications for Palestinian American travelers whose concerns about Israeli discrimination when [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=144.66s)]
*  they travel to the region are being downplayed by U.S. senators in their haste to get Israel [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=149.76s)]
*  into the program. And then in late July, the United States signed a memorandum of understanding, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=155.24s)]
*  an MOU with Israel relating to Israel's admission to the visa waiver program. According to the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=161.4s)]
*  American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, the ADC, quote, a major focus of the MOU is the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=168.16s)]
*  treatment of Arab and Palestinian passengers by Israel at ports of entry. For decades, Israel has [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=174.12s)]
*  subjected U.S. citizen travelers of Arab and Palestinian descent to humiliating searches, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=180.72s)]
*  delays, and restrictions on movement, among many other degrading practices. Notably, the ADC adds [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=186.88s)]
*  that the MOU and current Israeli policies do not guarantee fully equal and reciprocal treatment for [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=193.76s)]
*  all Americans. This is significant as entry into the visa waiver program requires that the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=199.96s)]
*  cooperating nation treats all U.S. citizens equally and that a blue passport is a blue passport. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=205.07999999999998s)]
*  We're joined by two members of the American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, Abed Ayyub, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=210.92s)]
*  ADC's National Executive Director, and Chris Habibi, National Government Affairs and Advocacy [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=216.32s)]
*  Director. Abed and Chris, thanks so much for being here today on the Electronic and Tafata podcast. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=221.95999999999998s)]
*  Thank you. We appreciate you having us on. Thank you. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=228.6s)]
*  So Abed, let's start by having you lay out the general issues that U.S. citizens of Palestinian [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  and Arab descent have had for decades trying to enter Palestine through either the Tel Aviv [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=238.44s)]
*  airport or the points of entry from Jordan and what the visa waiver program is. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=244.52s)]
*  Thank you again. The challenges facing Palestinians trying to enter Israel, particularly [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=251.16000000000003s)]
*  Palestinian Americans and Arab Americans in general, trying to enter Israel to get to [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=258.36s)]
*  Palestine, to get to the West Bank, or to get to Gaza have been well documented. We know the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=263.72s)]
*  long checkpoints. We know the detainment that happens at the airport, the intrusive questioning, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=269.24s)]
*  the bans. This has all been well documented by human rights groups both here in the U.S. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=277.16s)]
*  and in Palestine. So the examples are out there. And what the visa waiver program is intended to do, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=283.08s)]
*  it's intended to make travel of citizens between agreed countries that are part of the program [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=290.84000000000003s)]
*  easier. So if you have, for example, Croatia, I believe was the last country entered into the program, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=297.24s)]
*  nationals of Croatia could travel to the U.S. without a visa and vice versa. But we know that [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=302.84000000000003s)]
*  Israel is not Croatia. It's not any other country that's part of the program. There's 40 countries [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=308.52s)]
*  that are part of it. Israel is the only one right now that has a system of apartheid and a system [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=313.48s)]
*  of treating people differently according to their race, where they were born, their religion, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=318.12s)]
*  as soon as they get to a checkpoint or a port of entry. And that's the problem. That's the [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=323.08s)]
*  issue we're seeing here. In a perfect world, they would be admitted into the visa waiver program. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=329.8s)]
*  And as you mentioned, blue means blue. That means anybody with a blue U.S. passport can go through [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=335.8s)]
*  the program, enter, go where they need to go. That's not the reality. And what we can get into, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=342.28s)]
*  what the memo laid out and the way this is going to be implemented if they are approved, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=348.28s)]
*  is basically creating different classes of U.S. citizens and the U.S. government signing off on [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=352.11999999999995s)]
*  that and essentially signing off on Israel's system of apartheid and stating and putting in [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=357.4s)]
*  policy that not all U.S. citizens are the same. And therein lies the problem that in a perfect world, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=365.64s)]
*  the visa waiver program would be welcomed by everyone. And I do want to note that we are [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=372.6s)]
*  seeing some positive stories and folks posting on social media that they were able to get in, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=378.6s)]
*  that they were able to go through the process. But you have to take a step back and look at [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=383.24s)]
*  the bigger picture. How long will this last? Is Israel only doing this now so they get admitted [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=386.84000000000003s)]
*  into the program? Once they're admitted into the program, will they go back to their past practices? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=391.88s)]
*  Never have we seen somebody enter the visa waiver program and then get removed from the visa waiver [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=398.28s)]
*  program. I doubt Israel would be the first, you know, if they do get admitted. So there's a lot [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=402.84s)]
*  of questions that remain even though we are seeing some individuals benefit from the current changes [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=407.71999999999997s)]
*  of policy that, you know, the Israelis have implemented. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=413.32s)]
*  And Chris, can you talk about the significance of the fact that Abed just mentioned that if the [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=417.88s)]
*  memorandum fails to specify any consequences, if Israel does not engage in reciprocity, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=425.24s)]
*  what could that mean for Palestinian travelers? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=433.88s)]
*  Basically, it could mean that as soon as Israel gets in, let's say it happens sometime in September, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=440.68s)]
*  come October, once again, Palestinian Americans that are on the Palestinian population registry [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=446.28000000000003s)]
*  are no longer able to enter through through through Ben-Gurion, which is what they should be [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=451.16s)]
*  able to do already. The policy that policy change that Israel announced late last month [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=457.16s)]
*  did allow for some of these Palestinians to enter through the airport. But at the end of the day, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=465.24s)]
*  we're still creating separate procedures for Palestinians, depending on whether they're on [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=472.36s)]
*  the registry, depending on where they are from. And some of the, you know, some of the questioning [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=477.48s)]
*  that happens routinely at Ben-Gurion, for example, is like, you know, they pull people of, you know, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=486.04s)]
*  Arab Palestinian descent aside and they start questioning them about their family, who their [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=494.36s)]
*  father was, what village, you know, they were from, where they're traveling. Would any of that very [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=501.0s)]
*  racist profiling system be, you know, be mitigated at the borders? Or would that kind of [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=509.16s)]
*  be continued in some sort of fashion? Do you have any idea? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=520.76s)]
*  So the MOU doesn't actually address the delays that happen, because we know that, you know, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=524.36s)]
*  quite often even Palestinians that aren't on the registry, Palestinian Americans who aren't on the [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=531.64s)]
*  registry get detained for hours. And whether they whether or not they get in, that is still a deeply [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=535.4s)]
*  humiliating experience to have to go through. Now, the MOU addresses specifically getting, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=542.44s)]
*  entering and exiting, receiving the visa approved, essentially, but it doesn't address the [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=549.64s)]
*  specifics of the detainments. And it does create these carve outs for security for immigration [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=558.4399999999999s)]
*  concerns that Israel may have, which goes back to the very racist Israeli laws that are already on [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=567.3199999999999s)]
*  the books. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, go ahead, Abed. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=574.04s)]
*  Right. No, I was going to add there. I don't anticipate that those practices will go away. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=578.6s)]
*  The Israeli government will continue using, you know, the excuse of national security to justify [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=584.2800000000001s)]
*  their actions. That's something this government did in the immediate aftermath of 9-11 and continues [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=590.2800000000001s)]
*  to do in targeting, you know, Arab Muslim travelers in the U.S., including U.S. citizens. So I doubt [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=595.48s)]
*  that they're not going to allow Israel to do and continue what they're doing. And that is a cause [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=601.24s)]
*  of concern. That's something that was not mentioned in the memo. Again, those stories are out there. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=605.48s)]
*  We've been dealing with them and hearing about them for decades, the humiliation that they put [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=609.4s)]
*  individuals through. And they do that intentionally. So individuals say, you know, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=614.52s)]
*  I don't want to travel here. I'm going to go back. That is their intention and putting them [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=617.8000000000001s)]
*  in the rooms, detaining them, holding them for hours, the humiliation. That's part of their [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=622.28s)]
*  MOU. That's what they want to do. And I doubt that they'll stop doing that, even if admitted into the [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=628.2s)]
*  waiver program. Right. Let's talk a little bit about the separate procedures for U.S. citizens [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=634.36s)]
*  deemed residents of the West Bank or residents of Gaza and how the U.S. is continuing to endorse [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=641.16s)]
*  Israel's apartheid policies for those Palestinian Americans. As your group says, quote, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=646.9200000000001s)]
*  under the system established by the MOU, Palestinian Americans from Gaza are treated as second class [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=653.8000000000001s)]
*  citizens and are subject to a completely different set of rules. Only Palestinian Americans with [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=659.48s)]
*  first degree family ties are allowed to apply for permission to enter Gaza and they must travel [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=665.32s)]
*  through the West Bank. The only exceptions made are for children under the age of 12, meaning that [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=670.2s)]
*  those older would be prevented from visiting grandparents. Those eligible must apply 45 days [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=675.48s)]
*  prior to traveling and are only allowed to apply once a year. So again, these just monumental [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=681.0s)]
*  restrictions. What could this program change if there is reciprocity for those Palestinian Americans [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=687.08s)]
*  with residency papers from the West Bank or Gaza, if anything? Yeah. So I wanted to just take a step [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=698.2s)]
*  back. Both of those terms that are used in the MOU, resident of the West Bank, resident of Gaza, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=707.32s)]
*  neither have a definition. So as of right now, we don't know what Israel will consider [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=714.12s)]
*  a resident of the West Bank, a resident of Gaza. It could be as bad as anybody on the [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=721.24s)]
*  population registry is considered a resident. So now they are subject to specific rules, entry [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=728.92s)]
*  requirements. We're already seeing that those that have, quote unquote, residency in the West [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=735.64s)]
*  Bank are being told you can't enter through this checkpoint, you have to go to a different checkpoint. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=743.8s)]
*  Oh, you can't cross over a checkpoint in a car. Whether as a driver or a passenger, you have to [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=748.36s)]
*  get out of the car, go on foot. So these rules are creating separate classes of Americans. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=753.48s)]
*  Now in a perfect world, if the visa waiver program and all its requirements are met, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=763.8s)]
*  Palestinian Americans can go visit family in Gaza. They can go to the West Bank. There is no [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=770.1999999999999s)]
*  restrictions. They can travel. They can rent cars. They can do basically anything that a normal [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=776.12s)]
*  tourist would be able to do when visiting Israel. And this program, when is it expected to begin? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=781.4799999999999s)]
*  And what obstacles could be in the way leading up to it in the next couple months? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=793.16s)]
*  The trial period is over on September 30th. And if a decision is not made by the 30th of September, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=799.48s)]
*  the end of the fiscal year, the US government's fiscal year, then the process will have to start [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=808.6800000000001s)]
*  over on October 1. They'll have to aim for next year. So the immediate deadline in front of us [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=813.96s)]
*  is September 30th. And the hurdles standing in the way of Israel being admitted are its own [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=820.6s)]
*  policies and practices in its own system, apartheid system that's in place. And their unwillingness to [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=826.84s)]
*  really abide by the visa waiver program coupled with the US government's willingness to be [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=835.4s)]
*  complicit and help them navigate and wiggle their way around things and creating different [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=841.16s)]
*  categories and even letting it get this far is troubling and concerning. And one thing to keep [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=847.0s)]
*  in mind is even if this administration does not admit Israel into the visa waiver program, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=854.2s)]
*  you may get a future administration that will look and say, you know what, they've done enough. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=859.72s)]
*  We put them through the ringer. This is good enough for me. So hypothetically, you can have [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=864.44s)]
*  a Trump administration or a DeSantis administration come in and say, thank you, Biden. You all did [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=868.6s)]
*  good. I mean, let's just pick it up where we left it off and admit them. So the groundwork [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=874.28s)]
*  for admission, at least in my opinion, is there. It's just a matter of whether or not we can push [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=879.9599999999999s)]
*  it past the 30th and keep applying pressure to the current administration not to allow it to happen. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=886.36s)]
*  And the one thing I will add with this current administration in place, with DHS, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=894.8399999999999s)]
*  they have been receptive in meeting and hearing out the community concerns. So it's not as if [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=899.32s)]
*  ADC and Chris and other Arab organizations and Palestinian community members, they've been around [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=905.8000000000001s)]
*  the table really giving their insight and having an opportunity to present for the first time [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=911.8000000000001s)]
*  the impacts of these Israeli policies. So that's a positive, but that may not exist if this [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=917.48s)]
*  administration changes in the future. And that, in my opinion, will just [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=924.92s)]
*  raise Israel right into the program. Right. Especially if there's no consequences, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=928.04s)]
*  if the program is implemented and then Israel reverts back to its apartheid discriminatory [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=933.56s)]
*  policies at the border. Chris, how should Palestinian Americans and Palestine solidarity [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=940.04s)]
*  activists be organizing right now in order to push lawmakers to guarantee the reciprocity [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=946.92s)]
*  and even impose consequences if the reciprocity is broken? And what is the role that civil rights [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=953.48s)]
*  organizations such as the ADC is taking on? Great question. So I think the most important [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=959.56s)]
*  thing that folk can do right now is reach out to their member of Congress, let them know that, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=968.36s)]
*  you know, at first, this MOU, we have not seen an official signed copy. Now there are drafts that [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=973.96s)]
*  have been circulating around, but the U.S. government is refusing to release the MOU. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=982.04s)]
*  So, you know, first and foremost, they let their members of Congress know, hey, this is not okay. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=988.76s)]
*  You can't negotiate away our rights in secret. Two is to have them join with their fellow members [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=994.8399999999999s)]
*  of Congress to send a letter to DHS, to the State Department saying, from what we have seen, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1004.9200000000001s)]
*  this is not okay. From the policy changes that Israel has announced, this is not, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1012.36s)]
*  it is nowhere close to reciprocity. And then the final thing that I think is important for [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1017.32s)]
*  lawmakers to do is hold a hearing. You know, especially on the Senate side, Senator Gary [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1022.84s)]
*  Peters is the Senator from Michigan where there's a giant Arab American population. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1028.92s)]
*  His constituents are going to be affected by this. And as the Chairman of the Homeland Security and [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1035.4s)]
*  Government Affairs Committee in the Senate, he has the authority and the remit to bring in folks from [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1041.48s)]
*  the State Department, from DHS, and ask them point blank, what went into this MOU? How are you [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1049.16s)]
*  approaching reciprocity? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1056.52s)]
*  And, Abed, did you want to add anything? [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1060.84s)]
*  The one thing I would add, you know, in addition to, you know, pushing your members of Congress and [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1064.12s)]
*  pushing this out there is don't fall into the trap of the stealth PR campaign, you know, Israel is [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1069.72s)]
*  engaging in, just as they engage in others. And, you know, by them allowing, you know, specific [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1077.16s)]
*  individuals through by allowing people to, you know, tape themselves or record themselves going [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1084.52s)]
*  through and post selfies from the airport, we're, you know, doing the work for them. And this could [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1090.92s)]
*  be temporary. And again, we understand how good it is and how positive it is and has been for a [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1097.4s)]
*  lot of travelers. We just want to see that extended to all travelers. We want to see that extended to [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1104.68s)]
*  anybody with an American passport. At the same time, we can't be caught up in Israeli propaganda [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1109.72s)]
*  and believe, you know, just because some individuals have a good, this is a great program. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1116.44s)]
*  We need to continue standing up for and advocating for all individuals, you know, everybody and not [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1121.8s)]
*  set aside, you know, individuals from Gaza because, you know, oh, we can deal with them later. No, no, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1127.88s)]
*  this has to be dealt with now. It's all or nothing. And continuing to push that and continuing to [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1133.16s)]
*  push against the narrative that this is, you know, we're not going to have a perfect program, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1138.2s)]
*  but this is good enough. No, it could be better. And it has to abide by, you know, the standards [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1143.32s)]
*  that the law and the regulations for visa waivers set forth. At ADC, we're going to continue pushing [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1150.1200000000001s)]
*  this. I know there's a, you know, looking into legal strategies as well. And they are admitted. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1155.16s)]
*  What we could do on that front is always an option. And there's always the understanding [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1161.4s)]
*  that the only way to really paint this picture is to collect stories and to collect examples [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1169.0s)]
*  of things happening. So we encourage people that if they do travel overseas, if they are at the [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1174.76s)]
*  airport or at the border crossing, at the bridge and they're not permitted to go in or they're not [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1180.2s)]
*  allowed to go in, they're turned away, they need to file with the U.S. State Department and let [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1185.4s)]
*  them know here's what happened. Then at the same time, ADC has a link which is on our website, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1190.36s)]
*  which we can share the link with you to pass out. We need to collect those stories. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1195.4799999999998s)]
*  We need to be able to show the State Department that, hey, you know, this many individuals were [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1199.6399999999999s)]
*  turned away. Here's why they were turned away. Then set the pattern and give them the data so [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1204.04s)]
*  they can understand how this is not necessarily working the way it should. So that's a very [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1207.9599999999998s)]
*  important component to educate the travelers, to educate those going over there and let them know [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1213.0s)]
*  if you are turned away, we need to hear your story. We need to collect that information. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1217.8s)]
*  MS. Yeah, that's really important. And for people wanting to learn more about your work explaining [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1221.8s)]
*  and documenting what's happening with the Visa Waiver Program, where can they go? [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1230.52s)]
*  MR. ADC.org. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1235.8s)]
*  MS. Wonderful. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1238.36s)]
*  MR. You'll see it. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1239.32s)]
*  MS. Excellent. Well, thank you so much. We'll of course have updates as this program moves [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1239.72s)]
*  through legislature and the State Department and DHS and all of that. So we'll have you back on [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1247.48s)]
*  probably at the end of September when we know more. That is Abed Ayyub and Chris Habibi from [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1254.84s)]
*  the American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, ABC. Abed and Chris, thank you so much for all [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnyjc3tZSQ&t=1261.8s)]
