# Emergency medicine doctor reveals what she witnessed in Gaza, with Mimi Syed
**The Electronic Intifada:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0)
*  Hello and welcome back to the Electronic Intifada podcast. I'm Nora Barrows-Freedman. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=0.0s)]
*  A new report submitted to the United Nations by an international team of physicians and [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=5.44s)]
*  human rights advocates documents what its authors describe as a two-pronged attack on [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=10.36s)]
*  health care workers in Gaza and around the world to silence critique of Israel's genocide. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=16.42s)]
*  The report, Health Care Workers as Human Rights Defenders, a medical perspective on Israel's [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=22.8s)]
*  genocide-enablement apparatus in Gaza and abroad, highlights the urgent need for a medical [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=28.64s)]
*  definition of genocide as defined by Doctors Against Genocide to enable timely interventions [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  by health care workers. Meanwhile, in January, the aid agency Save the Children issued a report on [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=40.64s)]
*  Israel's explosive weapons in Gaza. The group estimates that in 2024, an average of 475 children [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=48.0s)]
*  each month, or 15 children a day, were left with potentially lifelong disabilities, including [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=57.72s)]
*  amputated or severely injured limbs and hearing impairments because of the explosive weapons. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=64.56s)]
*  These injuries, Save the Children adds, have been worsened due to the decimation of the health [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=70.12s)]
*  system and destruction of health facilities in Gaza, as well as the restricted flow and low [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=76.44s)]
*  availability of medicines, which has made treatment, therapeutic, or rehabilitative care inside [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=82.2s)]
*  Gaza near impossible. Children who have lost legs require long-term specialist care as they [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=88.88s)]
*  grow with regular reviews of appropriate prosthetics and other treatments, sometimes as much as every [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=96.12s)]
*  six months. These treatments, Save the Children says, are currently impossible to receive in Gaza. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=102.52000000000001s)]
*  Joining us again to talk about the medical catastrophe in Gaza and much more is Dr. Mimi [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=109.32000000000001s)]
*  Syed. Mimi is an emergency physician who worked in Gaza twice last year. We had her on here on [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=114.92s)]
*  the Electronic Intifada podcast in late December when she was still working in Gaza. She was part [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=121.44s)]
*  of a group of medical professionals who recently met with US lawmakers in Washington DC to talk [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  about what they witnessed. Mimi, thank you so much for coming back to the Electronic Intifada [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=132.68s)]
*  podcast. Hi, thanks for having me, Nooran. It's good to see you again. I want to talk about your [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=137.35999999999999s)]
*  visit to Washington in a few minutes, but first, can you talk about the ceasefire and what terms, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=143.28s)]
*  you know, healthcare wise Israel has agreed to that it is not upholding. We're recording this [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=148.96s)]
*  on February 20th and Israel still has not allowed in essential medical equipment, medicine, let [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=157.56s)]
*  alone the heavy machinery needed to remove the rubble and rebuild the hospitals that Israel has [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=163.4s)]
*  decimated over the last 16 months. What is important to know about the ceasefire terms [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=168.72s)]
*  and Israel's obligations that it is continuing to fail to meet specifically around the medical [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=174.36s)]
*  sector? Yeah, I mean, I think the term ceasefire is kind of a loosely used term. The situation in [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  the healthcare sector has not changed really. I have colleagues that I still speak to that are [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=191.64s)]
*  still working in the hospitals and, you know, just a few days ago spoke to Dr. Al-Farah, who is a [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=197.48s)]
*  pediatric intensivist at Nasser and he was telling me that life-saving medications are being blocked [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=202.88s)]
*  still. And there's just really no reason for it. You know, there's children that are going to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=209.23999999999998s)]
*  actually die if they don't receive these medications and this continues. And you mentioned, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=214.27999999999997s)]
*  the heavy machinery needed to clear the rubble. I mean, you can't do anything if there aren't [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=219.04s)]
*  roads that are clear to drive on to get to the hospitals, to get to the places where aid is [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=223.2s)]
*  needed. This was promised under the agreement. Shelter and temporary houses were promised to be [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=228.0s)]
*  allowed to enter and those also are being held up at the border. You know, the amount of aid and the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=234.64s)]
*  things that are needed to repair, it's not even a... It's a very small fraction of what's actually [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=241.22s)]
*  being allowed in. And so, you know, even if you do have a ceasefire, you can't really do much with [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=246.76000000000002s)]
*  everything that's been destroyed. There's people that have gone back to the north that are going [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=252.8s)]
*  back to powder, that are going back to rubble. There's no houses there. In the north, the health [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=257.56s)]
*  care system is even worse off than the south. There are no standing, you know, functioning [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=262.24s)]
*  hospitals anymore. All of the machinery, all of the machines that were the medical equipment are [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=267.68s)]
*  deliberately like broken at Kamal-Edwan Hospital and Indonesian Hospital. So, you know, it's not [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=273.84s)]
*  even a fraction of what's actually was promised. But you can't really have a hospital if you don't [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=280.79999999999995s)]
*  have clean water, if you don't have electricity grid. All of those things are necessary to [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=287.12s)]
*  actually have a functioning brick and mortar hospital. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=292.12s)]
*  You treated so many children and young people while you were in Gaza as an emergency doctor. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=294.76s)]
*  You testified in Washington, D.C. about a little girl who an Israeli sniper had shot and you had [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=300.24s)]
*  CT scans of her head. If you could talk about her and also tell us the story of Mido Halimi, a [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=306.12s)]
*  teenager who had a large social media following and was brought into your emergency room after [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=312.68s)]
*  being severely injured in an Israeli airstrike. We actually have some CT scans of his head. Tell [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=318.64s)]
*  us about these two children as examples of those that you treated. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=328.08s)]
*  Yeah, Mira is a four year old little girl and I talk about her a lot in media. I also presented her CT [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=333.71999999999997s)]
*  scan when we went to speak to the Congress staff as well as in the UN in New York City. But she's a [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=338.96s)]
*  four year old girl that was eating breakfast on August 24th in her tent and she was shot in the [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=346.52s)]
*  head by a drone sniper as her parents reported. She was brought in, barely hanging on to life, of [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=351.56s)]
*  course. But I was able to do the initial saving her life by protecting her airway. And again, with [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=358.28s)]
*  a piece of medical equipment that was not allowed in by the Israeli military, I had to smuggle that [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=365.71999999999997s)]
*  laryngoscope that I used inside to save her life. But she was fortunately able to receive the [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=371.15999999999997s)]
*  surgeries and the care afterwards that she needed. But of course, with someone who has an injury [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=378.12s)]
*  like that is going to require further medical care, probably for the rest of her life in order to have [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=383.24s)]
*  any sort of normal life. And if you were to meet Mira, she looks like a normal little four year [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=389.4s)]
*  old. She talks and smiles and laughs and jokes around and says, I love you, Dr. Amimi. All of [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=395.88s)]
*  these things and I was able to reunite with her when I was back in December. But she's been waiting [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=403.24s)]
*  for medical evacuation. And since that time that we've been working at it, her mother has actually [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=409.16s)]
*  been injured because of another airstrike just recently after I returned in January. And she's [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=414.96000000000004s)]
*  now has a traumatic amputation to her limb. And she's the primary caregiver of this child. So not [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=420.8s)]
*  only does Mira need medical evacuation, but she her companion who would have been her mother is no [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=427.44s)]
*  longer a candidate to be her companion because she herself needs medical care outside of Gaza. And [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=432.72s)]
*  so and we know that adults aren't really allowed out for medical care, children are barely allowed [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=438.88000000000005s)]
*  out. So, you know, it just creates this terrible issue. And then you know, you add on top of it, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=444.24s)]
*  they're not allowed to travel with their other children. And so how do I ask a mother to separate [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=451.64000000000004s)]
*  from her small children? You know, it's just, I can't even imagine how that feels. And the people [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=456.92s)]
*  that are leaving are not allowed any kind of, you know, certainty if there will be able to return. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=465.8s)]
*  So knowing that your child is still there in these dire conditions, you know, I can't ask a mother to [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=469.96000000000004s)]
*  leave leave her children. So it just puts everybody in these unexpected these just terrible conditions [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=475.68s)]
*  worse than sometimes worse. I mean, if you asked me to leave my child, that would be a new level [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=482.16s)]
*  of hell for me, you know, so that those are the situations, those are the dire conditions that [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=486.72s)]
*  people are facing there, these decisions. And tell us about Meadow. I actually have some CAT scans [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=492.48s)]
*  that that you sent me, we can look at those. Tell us about this is a series of slides from the CT [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=500.04s)]
*  that that you got from him. Tell us his about him and his story and what happened and what these [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=511.44s)]
*  CAT scans reveal. Yeah, Meadow Halimi was a very prominent tic tac influencer, actually. I think [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=518.44s)]
*  he was in his late teens on and he was he was just this like, ray of sunshine and in the middle of [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=526.32s)]
*  all of this, you know, chaos and destruction, very positive and would just kind of show his life in [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=532.64s)]
*  the tents in the Malasi area. I understood later, I learned that he actually was an exchange student [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=539.64s)]
*  in the US at one point. And so he spoke really good English. And so, you know, people, the things he [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=546.24s)]
*  was saying would resonate with people here in this country, as well as other places, you know, just [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=553.36s)]
*  globally, and he had a huge following. But he had this routine, he would go to an internet cafe, and, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=557.1999999999999s)]
*  you know, basically show his daily life. And the day before he died on August 25, he got a haircut. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=563.48s)]
*  And, you know, was basically showing he went to the internet cafe, and he was trying to get some [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=573.5999999999999s)]
*  work done and things like that. But on August 26, he came in as part of a mass casualty incident, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=579.36s)]
*  where I was when I was working incidentally, it was my birthday, it was one of the worst mass casualty [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=585.8399999999999s)]
*  incidents that I've that I had there when I was there. We had hundreds of casualties that day, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=591.0s)]
*  on multiple times a day. But he was a part of a, afterwards, an airstrike and air raid in that Malasi [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=597.68s)]
*  area, which was, again, to note, a humanitarian safe zone. But we received dozens of patients that [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=606.28s)]
*  day. And it's common practice, and I think all of my colleagues have witnessed, you know, and Dr. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=612.4s)]
*  Mamoud and Nizam Mamoud actually testified in front of the parliament about this very thing that we [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=618.04s)]
*  witnessed, which was, after an air raid, drone snipers, or quadcopters, they call them, would go [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=622.7199999999999s)]
*  and actually shoot off and finish off the remaining people there. And they would be shot, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=629.0s)]
*  shot in the head, shot in the chest, you know, so that they're, you know, you're basically leveling [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=634.76s)]
*  off all of the survivors. And Mito, unfortunately, was one of those people. He was brought in, and it [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=639.28s)]
*  was reported in the news as a shrapnel injury. But he had two wounds in his head. And one was, you [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=646.0s)]
*  know, one was on the one side and the other was on the on the exiting side. And this was a bullet, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=653.48s)]
*  most likely. And you can see from the CT scan, it actually shows the path of this. And he, you know, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=659.36s)]
*  I actually tried to save his life, I was a I was able to intubate him, number one, but I was able to [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=666.96s)]
*  take him to the CT scanner, as you can see, and that's the way I was able to provide these images. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=673.16s)]
*  But he had, you know, two wounds on his head, which would most likely be an entry and exit wound. I [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=677.92s)]
*  examined his whole body, I did a fast scan on him, which is an ultrasound that reveals any kind of [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=685.64s)]
*  internal injuries in the abdomen or the thorax. Nothing was there, he was actually clean. I in [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=690.5799999999999s)]
*  fact have a video, and I was explaining in the video what happened to him. And he was shot by a [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=696.4399999999999s)]
*  drone sniper. And I believe that he was deliberately targeted as many, many people are when you see [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=702.96s)]
*  them shot in the head repeatedly. So it's unfortunate that it was reported as a shrapnel, it doesn't [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=709.6s)]
*  bring him back. But I feel like, you know, the truth still needs to be told about how how he was [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=716.88s)]
*  killed. On that day, we had multiple casualties from this very, you know, internet cafe that [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=721.84s)]
*  people were shot at, and most of them came in with bullets in the head. You know, and so it's just, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=728.76s)]
*  it's another example of just deliberately shooting. And he's not the first prominent figure and [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=737.8s)]
*  influencer that's been targeted. You know, many people there have been have been deliberately [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=743.68s)]
*  targeted and killed. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=748.92s)]
*  Can you explain to us what we're seeing here on these CT scans for people who aren't familiar with [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=750.68s)]
*  with imaging like this? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=758.28s)]
*  Yeah, typically with shrapnel, you would see some kind of shrapnel like leave behind, you know, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=760.04s)]
*  small fragments of metal or something like that. And these are actually not that you're just seeing [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=765.28s)]
*  a path of a metal object going through which usually is looks like a bullet. I've showed this to, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=770.04s)]
*  you know, other trauma surgeons that have extensive experience with dealing with neurotrauma, just like [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=776.6s)]
*  this penetrating trauma. And they said, you know, of course, you if you unless you witnessed it [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=782.3199999999999s)]
*  happening, you can't say that this was a bullet 100%. But this looks very suspicious for a bullet [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=786.52s)]
*  path. And, you know, I examined him, I spoke to people who brought him in, spoke to witnesses who [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=793.64s)]
*  saw what happened. And they told me that this was a quadcopter. And I that was routine practice for [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=799.96s)]
*  me is to ask people who brought him in what, you know, what happened. And I that's why I have a [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=805.88s)]
*  recording a video. And at the time, you know, I didn't know who this was, actually didn't know who [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=811.6800000000001s)]
*  Mito Halimi was until I returned. And my husband used to follow him and told me when I returned, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=817.2s)]
*  you know, hey, did you know Mito Halimi was killed? But when you were there, I said, Oh, I didn't [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=823.12s)]
*  know that. But when I went back, and I was processing all the images and the videos that I had, I you [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=827.9200000000001s)]
*  know, he looked so familiar to me. And I looked into it further. And I realized that this is Mito [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=833.64s)]
*  Halimi. And you know, the video that I submitted to you, you know, I'm saying in there too, this is [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=838.0s)]
*  a late teen shot by a quadcopter, I'm shot in the head. But this is essentially these red lines are [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=843.36s)]
*  showing the path of the entry from the entry or, you know, presumed exit entry. It's hard to tell, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=850.32s)]
*  but there's two wounds there. And it goes diagonally across the brain there. And it's a it's a clear [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=855.92s)]
*  pathway. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=861.68s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. So it goes from from the right side of the head to the to the left. Is that right? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=862.88s)]
*  Yeah, presumably. Yes. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=869.84s)]
*  Unbelievable. And when he showed up in the emergency department, I mean, what were you able [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=872.5600000000001s)]
*  to do with the limited amount of equipment and medication and, you know, and abilities? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=879.6s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it was just like when Mira arrived, you know, a couple days before that, you know, I [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=888.48s)]
*  tried to protect his airway number one, because that's the first thing, you know, in trauma or [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=894.4s)]
*  any anything really is to protect the airway to save his life. And, you know, a lot of times people [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=899.52s)]
*  with neurotrauma like this, when they're coming in as a mass casualty incident, they're basically [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=906.4s)]
*  left to die because there's very little resources to take care of them. And so it's considered a [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=912.0s)]
*  wasted effort to try to salvage someone with neurotrauma like that. But, you know, I don't know, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=917.04s)]
*  I intubated a lot of people and I was almost like, you know, people there were like, why are you [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=922.4s)]
*  intubating everyone? And it was one of those things for me, I just had to do it just to give people a [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=926.4s)]
*  chance. And Mito, unfortunately, you know, wasn't, wasn't he was he wasn't as fortunate as Mira. And, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=931.1999999999999s)]
*  you know, I wasn't able to save his life. And he ended up succumbing to the injury shortly after [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=939.12s)]
*  that. So. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=945.5999999999999s)]
*  When you came back, you recently went to Washington, DC, as I mentioned, tell us about [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=948.4799999999999s)]
*  what your intent was in meeting with US lawmakers, and if you were able to meet with any of them [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=956.3199999999999s)]
*  personally. And, and what what kinds of testimonies you gave there at the Capitol? And, you know, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=962.3199999999999s)]
*  what what the intent was in in bringing these stories, especially a story of Mira, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=972.24s)]
*  to US lawmakers? [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=978.24s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we had a multi approach kind of, you know, strategy, I guess you want to call it, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=980.64s)]
*  but we really just wanted to show as American physicians, this is what we witnessed. And it's [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=985.52s)]
*  important because we are funding this. And, you know, we I wasn't able to myself personally meet [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=990.9599999999999s)]
*  with any senior members. But I understand that a couple of other you know, we were in a group, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=996.72s)]
*  and they maybe met with someone that was somewhat in a senior position. But I met with basically [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1002.08s)]
*  interns. And we showed we had a press briefing as well, where we showed the CT scans, I showed a CT [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1007.0400000000001s)]
*  scan of Mira with the bullet in her head, among other things that we that we shared with them. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1012.72s)]
*  And, you know, unfortunately, it wasn't a it wasn't a big turnout. But when we did meet with [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1018.32s)]
*  various states, and there's their interns, our message was that this is this needs to stop. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1023.76s)]
*  These are children with 50% population of children, we are this is a war on children, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1031.36s)]
*  essentially, and we have to stop funding this. You know, and I I'm pretty naive, I thought, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1036.8799999999999s)]
*  Okay, well, I'm going to show them a book, you know, a CT scan of a child with a bullet in her [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1043.2s)]
*  head, they're going to say, Oh, my God, this needs to stop. You know, unfortunately, that's not the [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1047.2s)]
*  case. I think they think that they know this is happening. And I, I do think that they agree, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1051.76s)]
*  most people agree that shooting children in the head is wrong. But there's this elephant in the [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1058.4s)]
*  room that you can't say anything else after that. And, unfortunately, you know, it was, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1063.44s)]
*  it just felt like they were there to listen and they did, you know, for for their and most some [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1069.6s)]
*  states were more kind of receptive than others and sympathetic. But we also spoke about, you know, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1074.48s)]
*  re establishing UNRWA also re establishing, you know, more medical corridors to be allowed [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1080.4s)]
*  children evacuation, which is which is a really big thing that we're lacking. You know, when we [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1086.96s)]
*  went to DC afterwards, four of us went to United Nations in New York City to speak with them. And [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1093.1200000000001s)]
*  we were fortunately, they're obviously able to, to meet with Secretary General, which was we were [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1098.8000000000002s)]
*  very fortunate and very grateful for. But we spoke about having more medical corridors available [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1103.68s)]
*  for patients to evacuate to, and specifically, East Jerusalem and West Bank. Not only is it closer [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1111.04s)]
*  to Gaza, but it's also more cost effective. And the hospitals there are willing to take the patients. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1117.2s)]
*  You know, the block is from from the COGAT side, they're not allowed that transportation, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1123.52s)]
*  or that that path to get there. And it's so that's, you know, that's what we're advocating for. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1128.56s)]
*  But also, we just, you know, explain to them the dire conditions like the life expectancy after [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1135.36s)]
*  October 7 has dropped to 30 years by 30 years. That's like almost half of a person's life. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1139.76s)]
*  That's unheard of miscarriage chances after October 7 300%. If that's not a direct insult on the [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1146.96s)]
*  birth rate, and the growth of a population, I don't know what else is. I don't know how else to [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1155.36s)]
*  frame it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And along with that, as I mentioned, you submitted a report to the UN [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1160.8799999999999s)]
*  detailing the attacks on health care itself in Gaza, as well as international health care workers, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1171.84s)]
*  like yourself, who speak out about Israel's crimes and are being, you know, repressed, attacked, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1180.08s)]
*  targeted, or fired from their positions in US hospitals and clinics. And, you know, this is all [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1186.8799999999999s)]
*  in the context of trying to get an international, you know, definition of genocide applied to [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1198.48s)]
*  the catastrophic situation for Gaza's health care system. And, of course, you know, that goes along [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1205.92s)]
*  with the obligations under the International Criminal Court and the International Court of [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1215.92s)]
*  Justice who have assessed that Israel is most likely committing genocide. There are arrest [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1221.2s)]
*  warrants out for those, you know, in power in Israel who have carried out this genocide that [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1226.88s)]
*  are not being enacted on. Talk about this UN report and what kind of response it has received so far. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1234.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I think that this was more of a, you know, focus on health care and how we're being doxed, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1243.92s)]
*  essentially. But yeah, I mean, one of my colleagues spoke at the press briefing there at the UN and [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1250.32s)]
*  how difficult it was for her to kind of shift, change her shifts around. You know, she's another [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1255.92s)]
*  doctor. And how hostile the environment has become. And it's the same. I mean, you know, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1261.0400000000002s)]
*  we can't associate our workplace with the work that we're doing in Gaza. I deliberately go out [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1267.0400000000002s)]
*  of my way to not associate my workplace with the work that I'm doing in Gaza. And I know that a lot [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1272.48s)]
*  of physicians have been fired or have basically been put on this blacklist that, you know, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1279.0400000000002s)]
*  do not hire or whatever it is. And it's just, it's such a hypocritical thing because we stand for [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1284.56s)]
*  humanity as health care workers. We are supposed to be the protectors of humanity. And it doesn't [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1291.6s)]
*  mean that it's only for a subset of people. You know, this is across all boards. And so when we're [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1296.48s)]
*  being silenced, when these are just blatantly, you know, violations against humanity, it's just, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1300.96s)]
*  it's mind boggling to me that this continues to happen. And I think collectively, it's important [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1307.76s)]
*  as health care workers to have this voice, this unified voice, because we are more powerful that [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1313.2s)]
*  way. And we need to get out of this mindset that, you know, I'm scared or, you know, it's too much [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1317.8400000000001s)]
*  of a risk or this and that. I think everybody is capable of saying something in their own realm, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1324.24s)]
*  and to a certain extent. And I understand there's, you know, realistic aspects to this about keeping [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1329.68s)]
*  a job and whatnot, but I think that we can all make efforts in doing it. But yeah, and, you know, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1335.2s)]
*  I think that there has been some media release for this specific report. And hopefully, it'll [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1341.76s)]
*  gain the traction that we need. But it's, yeah, it's, it's, I think it needs to be pointed out. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1348.24s)]
*  And it definitely needs to be emphasized in the community. Yeah. What, what stories from I think [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1354.0s)]
*  I asked you this the first time that you were on the podcast, but what stories, what images, what, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1361.52s)]
*  what patients keep you up at night? What are you most worried about in terms of, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1368.5600000000002s)]
*  not just assessing the damage in Gaza to the health care system, but the enormous [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1377.2s)]
*  efforts that need to happen immediately in order to repair and rebuild the health care infrastructure? [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1385.1200000000001s)]
*  What are you, what are you thinking about these days? [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1394.16s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I'm thinking more about, you know, what happens now. And I'm afraid that people are [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1397.2s)]
*  looking away now because this, you know, this ceasefire has been, this has been announced. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1401.92s)]
*  And it's, it's like, there's a running joke now, like you seize, we fire. That's kind of like [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1406.64s)]
*  how, you know, the Israeli military sees it is we can break all these rules, but you can't. And [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1411.28s)]
*  there's been certain agreements that have, you know, been put in place, but they're just not being, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1417.6s)]
*  it's, there's no compliance with it from the Israeli military. But I'm worried about if this [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1422.08s)]
*  went back to, you know, the end of the ceasefire, I can't imagine something more cruel than that. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1428.3999999999999s)]
*  There are people that are so happy and that they're celebrating and they're able to go back to a [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1435.04s)]
*  somewhat, you know, normal existence because there's, there are no bombs dropping on their [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1438.8799999999999s)]
*  houses and their tents. But if we went back, I mean, I can't imagine that that's number one, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1444.08s)]
*  but two, we need to empower the people of Gaza to be able to rebuild their own population and [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1449.84s)]
*  their, their state because displacing them and moving them out of that land and then saying, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1457.6s)]
*  okay, we're going to make this great again or whatever it is and not allow them to return is [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1462.8s)]
*  probably about the most inhumane thing after they've endured 16 months of this, you know, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1467.84s)]
*  and they don't want to leave. They want to come back. And there's no reason why they should, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1473.6s)]
*  there's no reason why they should have to leave. That doesn't make any sense. It's just not, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1479.04s)]
*  it doesn't make sense on any level, like ethically, but also economically doesn't make any sense. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1484.0s)]
*  We need to be able to rebuild everything that's been destroyed. So all of the aid and all of the [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1490.32s)]
*  things that I spoke about earlier, the infrastructure, the electricity grids, I mean, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1495.28s)]
*  you know, when you go into Gaza, you see how the roads are just completely ripped apart, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1499.68s)]
*  the electricity grids, the water system, all of it has been completely annihilated. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1504.08s)]
*  And so you can bring, you know, temporary shelters back and such, but those type of things [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1509.36s)]
*  need to be rebuilt and they need to allow the equipment needed to rebuild that. And the staff, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1514.0s)]
*  the people, the trained professionals that they should be allowed in. And even if that means [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1519.84s)]
*  foreign aid workers being allowed in, they should be allowed in this whole restricting these type [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1526.4s)]
*  of things is a further, like another level of inhumanity. It's just, it needs to stop. It has [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1531.44s)]
*  to stop. Yeah. Yeah. And what do you think is the most important thing that people, you know, [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1539.6000000000001s)]
*  who are not involved in the medical relief world can do? What are some, you know, tactical, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1550.0800000000002s)]
*  practical ways that people can get involved? Yeah. I mean, I think the biggest, you know, thing is [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1560.72s)]
*  understanding this whole excuse of there are, you know, Hamas terrorists and things like that, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1569.28s)]
*  that they're trying to say are in the hospitals. And, you know, we all live there for extended [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1576.0s)]
*  periods of time. I was there two times. I lived there for four weeks straight in and out of the [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1582.24s)]
*  hospital at all hours. Spoke to everybody there. Nothing was restricted for us in the hospital. We [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1586.96s)]
*  never saw it in military combatants. We never saw weapons. So that excuse, that narrative that we're [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1592.08s)]
*  doing it because we're trying to get at something, that's just not true. It's just not true. And the [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1598.08s)]
*  public needs to understand that, that that's been the excuse, the running excuse to destroy this [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1602.48s)]
*  healthcare system. But also you cannot bomb an idea out of a person's head, right? The idea that [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1607.2s)]
*  they want to exist, that they want to live in their state, that they belong to, that they were [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1614.88s)]
*  born in. You cannot bomb that idea out of people's head as a collective population. You can't bomb [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1620.64s)]
*  people into suppression, into submission. And so that narrative of, you know, we're trying to get [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1626.16s)]
*  rid of a certain group of people, of we're trying to get rid of Hamas, you're trying to get rid of [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1633.44s)]
*  an idea. And that's just not possible. And we've seen what happened after ceasefire, you know, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1638.88s)]
*  clearly nobody was gotten rid of. And so I think that people in general need to understand that [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1644.3200000000002s)]
*  being silent in the face of evil is evil itself, right? A very famous quote by Bonhoeffer Dietrich, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1653.0400000000002s)]
*  that we cannot continue to remain silent. We have to say, we have to speak up. And for some people, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1660.0800000000002s)]
*  that means protests. For some people, that means doing media. For some people, that means doing, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1666.16s)]
*  you know, educational talks or whatever. And it may just be simply having a conversation with [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1670.3200000000002s)]
*  somebody about it, just to change the narrative. And I've seen some beautiful things come out of [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1676.4s)]
*  like musicians and artists, and you know, to represent what's actually been happening in Gaza. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1682.24s)]
*  And everybody has their part. Everybody has their role. But we just can't bury our heads in the sand [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1688.4s)]
*  anymore, so to say, is just not okay, especially in the United States, where we are directly funding [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1694.32s)]
*  this. That's right. And just because there's a ceasefire doesn't mean that the fight is over for [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1700.72s)]
*  Oh, gosh, no. Yeah. Yeah. Well, Dr. Mimi Syed, thank you so much again for coming back on the [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1707.4399999999998s)]
*  Electronic Intifada podcast. You know, please keep us posted on Mira's condition. I think a lot of [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1715.12s)]
*  our audience would like to know that she and her mother and her family are, you know, are not just [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1724.4799999999998s)]
*  surviving, but thriving, and hopefully they get the care they need. So yes, please keep us posted, [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1733.12s)]
*  and we'll have you back on very soon. Thank you so much. Thank you, Nora. Bye bye. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S0nzEFtEb0&t=1740.2399999999998s)]
