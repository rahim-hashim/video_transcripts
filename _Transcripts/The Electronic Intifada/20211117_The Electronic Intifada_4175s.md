Video Description: On episode 47, Asa and Nora speak with David Miller, a sociology professor and leading critic of the Israel lobby who was fired by the University of Bristol on 1 October. 
Miller was sacked after a years-long campaign of smears by that same lobby.
He talks about his ongoing work researching the history of Zionism, Israel‚Äôs state ideology, and how the lobby‚Äôs efforts to smear and silence him have only led him to speak louder.
‚ÄúI think one of the things which has become clear in this process is that it‚Äôs necessary to talk about Zionism,‚Äù Miller tells us.
‚ÄúThis is about dismantling ideology,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúthe same way as we would talk about dismantling racism ‚Äì racism is not just a set of ideas. It has material forms and practices.‚Äù
He argues that ‚ÄúIf you want to dismantle and eradicate Zionism, you have to dismantle the apparatus which puts it in place.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe road to socialism in Britain, if there is such a thing, goes through the Zionist movement,‚Äù Miller says. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt go around it, it goes through the Zionist movement. You can‚Äôt go around Zionism.‚Äù
With the successful campaign by Israel and its lobby to remove Jeremy Corbyn as leader of the Labour Party, these same forces have now moved on to academia and the rest of the public sphere in Britain.
Miller‚Äôs sacking is just the start. He says it is a question of ‚Äúwhen people will have the confidence ‚Ä¶ to fight back and to say no to this? I think we‚Äôre in the foothills of this [campaign].‚Äù

# Why we have to talk about Zionism with David Miller | EI Podcast
**The Electronic Intifada:** [November 17, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk)
*  The Zionist movement is calling for the end of the Israeli government. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=0.0s)]
*  Calling crimes of the Israeli government, but the Zionist movement itself, which of course exists, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=10.0s)]
*  and the condition of its existence is that it helps to support and launder the image of the Israeli government's activities. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=14.6s)]
*  The Electronic Intifada. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=24.4s)]
*  This is the Electronic Intifada Podcast. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=28.599999999999998s)]
*  I'm Nora Barrows-Freedman. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=31.599999999999998s)]
*  And I'm Asa Wyn Stanley. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=33.6s)]
*  And welcome back to the Electronic Intifada Podcast. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=40.599999999999994s)]
*  I'm Nora Barrows-Freedman with Asa Wyn Stanley. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=43.0s)]
*  Before we go to this episode, which is a wonderful interview with David Miller, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=45.8s)]
*  Asa, you had a little update of news that happened between the time we recorded this interview with David and up till now. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=51.8s)]
*  Yes, that's right. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=60.4s)]
*  So since we shot this episode with David, I published an article which directly relates to issues that he talks about in the interview. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=62.4s)]
*  So later on in the interview, you hear him talking about two QCs reports, which a QC is just a fancy British name for a lawyer, basically. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=73.4s)]
*  So he's talking about two separate reports by a British lawyer, which both exonerated him of antisemitism. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=82.4s)]
*  So I have obtained one of those. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=91.4s)]
*  So and I wrote about it and it does, as David says in the interview, it does exonerate him of antisemitism. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=95.4s)]
*  It says, in fact, that he has no case to answer antisemitism. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=103.80000000000001s)]
*  So not only did it examine the claims, but did the lawyer examine the claims, but actually says that he should never have had to answer for these claims at all because they're baseless. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=108.60000000000001s)]
*  So definitely after you've watched the interview, check out that article. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=119.8s)]
*  And it's titled David Miller was cleared of antisemitism, leaked document shows we can we can just Google electronic into father. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=124.8s)]
*  David Miller, I know it should come up as the latest article. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=132.8s)]
*  We'll also have a link to that on the podcast blog post that accompanies this. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=135.8s)]
*  So without further ado, let's go to the interview with it. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=140.8s)]
*  We did with David Miller. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=143.8s)]
*  Welcome to the electronic into father podcast. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=145.8s)]
*  We're here today with David Miller, who until earlier this month was a sociology professor at the University of Bristol. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=148.8s)]
*  David is an academic expert on the Israel lobby and has published many valuable reports over the years. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=154.8s)]
*  He funded Spinwatch and its brilliant online database power base. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=160.8s)]
*  Bristol University fired him on the 1st of October following a long campaign against him by the Israel lobby. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=167.8s)]
*  In its announcement of the firing, Bristol gave no specific reason for the sacking, saying only that quote, he did not meet the standards of behavior we expect from our staff. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=174.8s)]
*  But the reality is that following the downfall of their previous target, Jeremy Corbyn pro Israel campaigners had made David their public enemy number one, especially since the start of this year. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=186.8s)]
*  They smeared him his research and his teaching as anti semitic due to the fact that he opposes Zionism Israel's racist official ideology. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=201.8s)]
*  So we're going to talk about all that and we're going to talk about the campaign against him and the reality behind it today on the electronic into father podcast. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=212.8s)]
*  David, welcome to the show. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=220.8s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=222.8s)]
*  Firstly, how are you doing, and have you had a lot of support since you were fired. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=225.8s)]
*  I'm doing okay. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=230.8s)]
*  You know, this is a pretty major thing to go through, having been in academia for, I think, three decades. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=231.8s)]
*  I have been to one morning just be told that's it and [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=240.8s)]
*  They didn't quite tell me to clean my desk by the evening but they cut off my email by the evening. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=246.8s)]
*  Disable my card to access the building etc. So I'm now an ex academic unless, of course, my appeal, which is due within 28 days of the sacking results in me being reinstated. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=253.8s)]
*  I don't have a great deal of optimism about that, but we'll certainly go through the process of an appeal. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=270.8s)]
*  And then of course there are other legal options available after that, which may take some time. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=275.8s)]
*  So I'm feeling fine really, given all that's happened. And yes, there's been a lot of support. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=281.8s)]
*  I noticed that there's something, someone's created a petition in my support which seems to have over 22 or 23,000 signatures in a couple of days, two, three days, which I'm a little bit surprised by, pleasantly surprised by. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=288.8s)]
*  And I've had, of course, lots of messages from people and I see there's been lots of activity online and offline as well, which I'm aware of in the union etc. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=305.8s)]
*  So, you know, I'm buoyed up by that, of course, but it's not a pleasant situation to be in and it's a real victory for the Zionist movement to be able to remove an academic. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=315.8s)]
*  I genuinely didn't think that this was going to be possible. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=329.8s)]
*  But here we are. It is. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=333.8s)]
*  I mean that weekend that you got fired, I actually got contacted by lots of people who were a bit shocked, you know, who I got texts by people saying, did you know this was going to happen? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=336.8s)]
*  And I had to reply saying, sadly, I suspected it would. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=349.8s)]
*  And, yeah, I mean, it's like you said, it is definitely a big victory for them. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=355.8s)]
*  It's a really difficult situation. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=366.8s)]
*  Sure. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=371.8s)]
*  David, talk a little bit about your work investigating the Israel lobby, how you began investigating it and what, you know, what it's led you to. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=373.8s)]
*  Okay, well, it was a long version and a short version of the story. So I'm going to try and go somewhere between the two of those. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=384.8s)]
*  I mean, I started in research in the eighties, doing a PhD on the Northern Ireland conflict. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=390.8s)]
*  And you might think that's got no relevance, but that's one of the things which, when it came to the moment of starting to do work on Israel-Palestine, that I, you know, I got a lot from that work. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=397.8s)]
*  That work was in propaganda and the media. So I got a lot from that work just on that theme of propaganda, but also perhaps more importantly from the question of understanding the Northern Ireland conflict in relation to settler colonialism. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=410.8s)]
*  I did a book in 1998 called Rethinking Northern Ireland, and I was the editor and I had a very long chapter which I allowed through the editorial process because I was the editor, which sets out the way of understanding the conflict in the North of Ireland as being about colonialism and actually about settler colonialism. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=425.8s)]
*  The settler colony in the North of Ireland bears really very remarkable similarities to the conflict over Palestine. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=446.8s)]
*  And so that's been something which has certainly informed my approach to this whole issue. And this is an interesting thing, isn't it? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=454.8s)]
*  You know, one of the things that the ISA says, oh, well, they pick out Israel and they demonize it and they delegitimize it and they use double standards. They don't say the same thing about any other country. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=463.8s)]
*  And that's the phrase, of course, the 3D phrase from Anatoly Sharansky from back in the early 2000s. And of course, that's not the case. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=477.8s)]
*  We don't think that settler colonialism is just something which affects Palestine. We think it has affected lots of other places, of course, most obviously South Africa, but also Algeria and the North of Ireland. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=486.8s)]
*  And indeed, those other places in the world where we don't think of settler colonialism anymore because the natives were entirely exterminated. So Australia, New Zealand, Canada, America, etc. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=498.8s)]
*  Now, these are obvious parallels with what's happening in Palestine. And yet people tend to shy away from making those kind of comparisons. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=510.8s)]
*  But there are comparisons which undermine the whole rhetoric of the Zionists on BDS, on de-legitimization, etc. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=520.8s)]
*  Because it shows that this is not an aberration. This is not because some terrible quality of the Jews to get involved in settler colonialism. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=528.8s)]
*  This is absolutely straightforwardly what happens in settler colonialism. So this is something which I've taken from my earlier work in addition to the work, this stuff in propaganda, which has really informed a lot of my understanding of the comfort over Palestine. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=537.8s)]
*  So to take you forward several years, I mentioned a book in 1998, which seems an eon ago now. I started really becoming interested in Israel-Palestine. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=552.8s)]
*  I mean, I'd always known about it in the background. When I was a student in the 80s, we had a Palestinian president of our Students Union and the University of Glasgow was twinned with Beersite University. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=564.8s)]
*  And there was a strong sense of the Palestinian struggle being one of a number of struggles which people wanted to express solidarity with. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=577.8s)]
*  South Africa was another, El Salvador, Nicaragua, etc. But I hadn't really ever become sort of involved or interested in it in research terms. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=586.8s)]
*  And it was only when I started to do work on the neoconservative movement in the aftermath of the Iraq War, I'd done work on the Iraq War on propaganda. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=596.8s)]
*  I think you can perhaps see the cover behind my shoulder called Tell Me Lies, which we published in 2004. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=604.8s)]
*  And after that, I went on to do some work on the neoconservative movement and in particular, the role of the neoconservative movement or the existence of the neoconservative movement in Europe, not just in the UK, but in other European countries. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=611.8s)]
*  We had a project called Neocon Europe where we said that the neocons are not just a movement in the US, which has been important in relation to the Iraq conflict, but also have spread across the world. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=626.8s)]
*  And the signature neocon ideas about Islam and about the need to tackle extremism and the ideas about radicalization, all of which are neocon-inflected, have very markedly affected public policy on counter-terrorism, on Islamophobia issues, etc. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=638.8s)]
*  across the continent in different ways at different times. So I got involved in studying the neocons then and that was the first time when we published a report back in 2009, I think, maybe 2010 on neoconservative think tanks in the UK policy exchange, the Centre for Social Cohesion, which became what's now the most important neocon think tank in this country, the Henry Jackson Society, named after, of course, the Democratic Senator Henry Jackson. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=658.8s)]
*  And I was accused then of being an anti-Semite and I was surprised. I was like, is this odd? Why are they, what's going on here? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=688.8s)]
*  And I was obviously outraged as well because I'm an anti-racist and I always have been. And that really irritated me and I couldn't quite understand it. And that's what provoked me, if you like, and has kept me going on studying the Sinist movement. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=700.8s)]
*  I never studied it before. It was only through that that I started to study the Sinist movement. And eventually we did stuff on, we did a report on BICOM, the British Israel Communications and Research Centre in the UK. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=716.8s)]
*  And then we did some more work on neoconservatives and we've done more work on them on the EU Israel lobby. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=730.8s)]
*  And since in the last three or four years, I've been doing a lot more work on the Israel lobbying and Sinism, some of which was published in my co-edited book, What is Islamophobia? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=736.8s)]
*  Where we said that one of the key, we talked about the five pillars of Islamophobia, if you get the gag. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=749.8s)]
*  And the first pillar, the backbone of Islamophobia, we said was the state's counterterrorism apparatus. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=756.8s)]
*  But there were four social movements who extend and pressure the state to go further against the interests of Muslims as a class. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=762.8s)]
*  And those were the neocons. Yes, the far right, the counter jihad movement as it's called, parts of the left, the pro-war left, some elements of the feminist movement, but also parts of the Zionist movement. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=771.8s)]
*  And it was that which got me into trouble. First of all, when this whole issue started back in 2019, maybe I'll stop there. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=783.8s)]
*  That tells you how I got into this, how I started to do the research. And I can tell you more about that if you want to know. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=793.8s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, and this happens to academics here in the United States as well, as they expose the Israel lobby, they talk about Zionism as a racist ideology openly. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=803.8s)]
*  And they become a target. And the Israel lobby wants to make an example of them by either trying to get them fired or, you know, and smearing them as an anti-Semite when it's completely absurd. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=817.8s)]
*  And sometimes they get what they want. And it seems like they have tried to make an example out of you and to scare other academics and scholars into silence. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=834.8s)]
*  Will you be silenced by this campaign? Is this changing who you are? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=850.8s)]
*  Well, I think you know the answer to that question, of course not. I mean, interestingly, isn't it? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=857.8s)]
*  I mean, this week I would be doing lectures and seminars on my module on terrorism, which I enjoy doing. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=863.8s)]
*  But not doing that means I have more time to focus on my research and writing efforts, which because of the investigation of me in the last 67 months, and indeed, going back for three years, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=872.8s)]
*  it's been very difficult for me to speak out and maybe come back to that. But I absolutely will not be silenced. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=883.8s)]
*  And I have a lot, a ton of material. Some of it ready to go and other stuff being finished off. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=891.8s)]
*  But I mean, maybe I could say a little bit about my understanding of Zionism, because that might help to understand, to understand, you know, why it is that they have been so keen on having a go at me. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=898.8s)]
*  You know, I'm just one of a number of people they're having a go at, but they are keen. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=911.8s)]
*  And also, you know, what I think about the question of Zionism. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=915.8s)]
*  I think one of the things which has become clear in this process is that it's necessary to talk about Zionism. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=920.8s)]
*  In the attack on the Jeremy Corbyn-led Labour Party, quite a number of people left said, you know, let's not use the Zed word. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=929.8s)]
*  Let's talk about something else. Let's just talk about Israel as the apartheid state. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=938.8s)]
*  Zionism just is too complex a topic or it means different things to different sorts of Jewish people. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=943.8s)]
*  And it's not necessarily just a racist ideology. It can have some kind of meaning. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=951.8s)]
*  And if you do that, you're going to alienate people, et cetera. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=956.8s)]
*  I've listened to some of that and I get some of that. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=959.8s)]
*  But actually, you know, the research that we've done shows, and this will not be a surprise to either of you, that the Zionist movement is an actually existing set of organizations. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=962.8s)]
*  You know, it was set up formally in 1897. The Zionist movement itself existed before that, but formally they set up in 1897. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=973.8s)]
*  And they created a number of organizations which, in the intervening couple of decades at the beginning of the 20th century, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=981.8s)]
*  which all of them of which exist today and which are the backbone of the transnational Zionist movement. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=989.8s)]
*  And these are formally existing organizations which relate to each other, have formal relations with each other, both funding and organizational. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=995.8s)]
*  And of course, the key one is the World Zionist Organization, the most important organization in the Zionist movement. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1004.8s)]
*  And there are three other organizations which were created, the GNF, the Keren Hazod, and the Jewish Agency, which are the four. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1012.8s)]
*  And as you know, they're called the National Institutions in Israel, and they all live in National Institutions house, one building in Jerusalem. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1023.8s)]
*  This is not something which is made up by conspiracy theories. This is the actuality of the situation. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1032.8s)]
*  There are four key bodies which are the head of the Zionist movement, and they're ruled by the periodically called Zionist Congress, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1038.8s)]
*  the ultimate decision-making body of the movement. And this is their words, not mine. This is what they have on their websites. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1049.8s)]
*  All of those organizations have either members or offices of bodies associated with them in all the countries where the Zionist movement is organized. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1055.8s)]
*  In the UK, for example, there's a GNF UK, there's a Keren Hazod branch, there's an office for the Jewish Agency, and more importantly, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1066.8s)]
*  in terms of numbers of organizations, the Zionist Federation of the UK has 30 or 40 members, many less than it used to have, but 30 or 40 members, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1075.8s)]
*  all of which are formally members of the Zionist movement. Now, this is something which just is an organizational fact about the Zionist movement. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1084.8s)]
*  And people don't understand that. They think that they have some kind of loose relationship. No, they have formal relationships with each other. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1092.8s)]
*  Too many people don't do the reading. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1100.8s)]
*  I find it really frustrating. People on the left, like Navarro Media kind of people, they just don't do the reading. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1107.8s)]
*  They think they can talk about it, but they haven't actually done the research that it takes to understand this movement. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1117.8s)]
*  Sure. I mean, so my point, I mean, I'm making this point in a rather long-winded way, so I'm sorry about that. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1127.8s)]
*  But my point is that not just that this is an actually existing set of organizations, which it is, and not just that there are also a host of other pro-Israel groups, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1133.8s)]
*  which are not formally part of the Zionist movement, which are informally part of the Zionist movement, something like the Community Security Trust or the Board of Deputies, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1141.8s)]
*  or the Jewish Leadership Council, all of which are not formally part of the Zionist movement, but actually in practice are pro-Israel organizations, as everybody knows, and as everybody who reads the reports can tell. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1149.8s)]
*  My point really is that these are actually existing organizations which do particular political activities in the UK and in the US and in Germany and France, et cetera, wherever the Zionist movement is organized. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1159.8s)]
*  And that means that we're not just talking about the deeds of the Israeli government. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1174.8s)]
*  We're not just talking about the ethnic cleansing in Sheikh Jarrah or Silwan, the assault on Gaza, the human rights abuses that everyone talks about, the judgment about whether Israel is an apartheid state, which of course it is, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1181.8s)]
*  or the question about whether it's a settler colonial society and whether Zionism is racism. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1195.8s)]
*  And of course, you know, everyone kind of knows what the answers to those questions are. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1200.8s)]
*  But actually the power, to the extent that it has power, and the influence of the Zionist movement is something which is separate to, in a way, the activities of the Israeli government. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1206.8s)]
*  It's not just the Israeli government which we've been condemning. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1221.8s)]
*  It's the huge apparatus of the Zionist movement, which is active in this country, in the US and in other countries where the Zionist movement is active. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1223.8s)]
*  And that is something which needs to be, I've said this before, directly targeted. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1231.8s)]
*  Zionism needs to be directly targeted wherever it is, and it's not just in Israel, it's elsewhere. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1236.8s)]
*  And people shy away from that. They say, well, you can't be talking about that because that somehow relates to the Jews or something. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1241.8s)]
*  And of course it doesn't. I mean, this is a political movement which has a particular set of political commitments. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1247.8s)]
*  And we have to face that it plays a negative role in this country and in many other countries too. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1253.8s)]
*  And it needs to be dismantled, not just the appalling crimes of the Israeli government, but the Zionist movement itself, which of course exists. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1260.8s)]
*  And the condition of its existence is that it helps to support and launder the image of the Israeli government's activities in the territories. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1269.8s)]
*  In fact, not just to launder the image, but to directly participate in the activities of the government in terms of settlements. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1278.8s)]
*  The WZO has a settlement division. The GNF is involved in the expropriation of Palestinian land. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1285.8s)]
*  As everybody who's read anything about these things will know. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1290.8s)]
*  So I think that what my work points to is the need politically to confront the Zionist movement wherever it raises its head. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1293.8s)]
*  And that's an uncomfortable message for someone left. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1303.8s)]
*  I mean, the road to socialism in Britain, if there is such a thing, goes through the Zionist movement. It doesn't go around it, it goes through the Zionist movement. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1306.8s)]
*  But you can't go around the Zionist movement. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1313.8s)]
*  Absolutely. Yeah. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1315.8s)]
*  I remember we first met David in 2011 in Birmingham during the Rad Salah appeal case. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1319.8s)]
*  So for our viewers and listeners, Rad Salah is a Palestinian leader, Palestinian citizen of Israel. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1330.8s)]
*  And to cut a long story short, he was the leader of a branch of the Islamic movement. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1340.8s)]
*  And essentially what happened after years of targeting of him by the Israeli government, his group was basically banned and he's now in prison because of that. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1350.8s)]
*  But he was a leader of activism, mainly in Jerusalem, of resisting Israeli settlement activities and Israeli encroachment, especially against Islamic holy sites in Jerusalem, especially the Al Aqsa mosque compound. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1364.8s)]
*  And because he was such a powerful leader, he was targeted by the Israeli government because of that for this kind of political persecution. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1388.8s)]
*  And as part of that, in 2011, he came to the UK and he came on basically a small tour. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1396.8s)]
*  He did some speaking events. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1405.8s)]
*  And what happened was essentially when he came to the country, he was expelled by the then Home Secretary Theresa May. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1407.8s)]
*  And he appealed this and you acted as a kind of witness for his defense, essentially. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1421.8s)]
*  And at the time, what happened in the end was he won that case. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1431.8s)]
*  He was kept under house arrest for the better part of a year, but he was not expelled from the country. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1437.8s)]
*  And he did that to make a political point. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1446.8s)]
*  He wasn't that he wanted to stay here as an asylum seeker. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1449.8s)]
*  He wanted to go back to his home in Palestine, but he didn't want to be expelled so that that would then be used against him when he went back to Palestine. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1452.8s)]
*  The Israeli authorities would use that against him. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1466.8s)]
*  And you've talked about the Zionist movement there in the Israel lobby. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1469.8s)]
*  And one of those organizations, which I know you've spoken of as being an informal part of the Zionist movement, is the CST, the Community Security Trust. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1473.8s)]
*  And they were instrumental in getting Brad Salah sort of banned by the British government at the time. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1482.8s)]
*  And they acted in a really deceitful way because they forwarded information on Brad Salah to the Home Office, which included outright fabrication. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1494.8s)]
*  There was a poem that he'd written which they or somebody altered to insert the word you Jews to make it look like an anti-Jewish poem. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1508.8s)]
*  Where actually, if you looked at the original poem itself, it was a poem about condemning Israeli atrocities and Israeli bombings of mosques and so forth. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1523.8s)]
*  So this is a long question to ask you. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1535.8s)]
*  Do you think the CST is basically holding a grudge against you all this time? [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1541.8s)]
*  Because we know that they've been involved in this more recent campaign against you. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1547.8s)]
*  Well, of course, I mean, that's part of the story, isn't it? [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1553.8s)]
*  I mean, the story of Salah, I mean, I was an expert witness for the defense. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1556.8s)]
*  And so I provided evidence on the CST and its inability or unwillingness to tell the difference between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1560.8s)]
*  And of course, it provided evidence, which, you know, including evidence of anti-Zionist Jews and false evidence as it turned out to the Home Office and the border agency, [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1572.8s)]
*  which, as you say, directly resulted in the order being issued that he wasn't allowed to come into the country. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1584.8s)]
*  He had come into the country anyhow the previous day and they missed him and they were a bit embarrassed about that. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1590.8s)]
*  But I just want to say one other thing about that, which was that this issue came to the attention of the Home Office, as we saw in the documents. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1595.8s)]
*  I think you probably saw the documents as well, the legal documents. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1601.8s)]
*  It came to the attention of the border agency and of the Home Office by a post on Harry's place, the Islamophobic blog. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1604.8s)]
*  Now, quite often I hear people on the left say, well, Harry's place is just a kind of, you know, horrible blog and you might not like it, but it doesn't have any effect. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1612.8s)]
*  It's, you know, it's just daft people saying horrible stuff. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1620.8s)]
*  And that's true. It is daft people saying horrible stuff, racist stuff about Muslims especially. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1625.8s)]
*  But this is how it works. This kind of stuff, you know, Guido, Harry's place, the far right blogs is taken up by actually existing civil servants [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1631.8s)]
*  and passed on and actioned as effective as intelligence. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1640.8s)]
*  And that was what brought the issue to the attention of the border agency. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1645.8s)]
*  They then approached the CST and the CST provided them with information which was distorted and included, as you said, fabrications. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1650.8s)]
*  And that revealed to us, I think, at the time, something about the CST, which I think if I look back at my witness statement at the time, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1658.8s)]
*  we knew that there was something wrong with the CST. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1668.8s)]
*  We knew that they were engaged effectively in spying on the Palestinian solidarity movement and indeed on anti-Zionist Jews. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1671.8s)]
*  I quoted in my statement the examples from Jewish anti-Zionist groups who had been manhandled and removed from events by CST thugs. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1678.8s)]
*  And so we knew some of that stuff, but we didn't know, I think, how far that went. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1688.8s)]
*  And we didn't, I think, I think you revealed in some of your reporting actually at the time its links with Mossad and the like. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1692.8s)]
*  And that was very important, I think, to start to understand the CST in that way. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1699.8s)]
*  And I think now my understanding of the CST has been enhanced by understanding what's happened, what happened in the US from the 1940s, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1704.8s)]
*  almost actually from before the 1940s with the experience of the obvious comparator organization in the US, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1715.8s)]
*  which, of course, is the Anti-Defamation League, which does almost exactly the same thing as the CST does here. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1723.8s)]
*  It's, of course, been involved since the 1940s in pursuing this idea of a new anti-Semitism, the Arabs or anti-Semites, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1730.8s)]
*  before the creation of the state of Israel. And at the time of McCarthyism and the House of American Activities Committee's inquiries, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1738.8s)]
*  was engaged in providing intelligence to the FBI and indeed, of course, to the forerunner of the Mossad before it was created and then afterwards directly to Mossad. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1747.8s)]
*  And this is well known that this is what they do. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1756.8s)]
*  And one sees the CST in very much the same role here as having connections with Mossad, as you reported, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1758.8s)]
*  and also very close connections with the police and the security services in this country. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1765.8s)]
*  And one of the things that you can see that they've done is to attack people who are supporters of Palestine and to attack anti-Semites Jews. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1773.8s)]
*  I mean, you've said that already. And that's an important thing to say that they're effectively an intelligence agency, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1783.8s)]
*  gathering material to use against their enemies. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1790.8s)]
*  But I think the other thing we don't realize and haven't recognized as much as perhaps we should is that the reason that they had this contact with Mossad, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1793.8s)]
*  which was revealed, I think, by Tony Lerman, whose memoir on the making and making of Zionists is a recommended reading for everyone who wants to understand Zionism, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1803.8s)]
*  was that they had a role with Mossad in the discussions in the early part of the 2000s about how to combat anti-Semitism worldwide. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1816.8s)]
*  And there was a coordinating forum against anti-Semitism, which was an Israeli government body, which Cheransky was involved in at the time. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1827.8s)]
*  And then, of course, they set up the Global Forum for Combating Anti-Semitism. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1836.8s)]
*  And this coordinating forum was an Israeli government body, but it also had the World Jewish Congress, it had the ADL, it had the CST involved in it. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1841.8s)]
*  This is the place where they came up with the idea that they would focus especially on blurring together anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1848.8s)]
*  And that led ineluctably and inexorably to the EUMC definition, working definition of anti-Semitism in 2004. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1857.8s)]
*  And then, of course, when that failed as a strategy to lodging it with the IHRA in order that they could, then in 2016, wasn't it, emerged weapon in hand to take on corporate. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1866.8s)]
*  So the CST has been core to all of that as well. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1882.8s)]
*  That is to core to actively pursuing and helping the interests of the Israeli state, like it says in its defence. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1885.8s)]
*  We are a British Jewish organisation. We've got nothing to do with Israel. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1894.8s)]
*  That's a lie. And everyone should know that. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1897.8s)]
*  And people, I think, on the left don't appreciate that. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1900.8s)]
*  That's a lie. And I'd be very happy for the CST to sue me if they wanted to over that. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1903.8s)]
*  And they know where I am, so they can come and get me. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1910.8s)]
*  So yes, the CST, of course, have had some animus against me. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1913.8s)]
*  We've had the occasional interaction on Twitter and like they don't really like to go into detail because when they get to the detail, they kind of can't really justify what they're doing. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1917.8s)]
*  But they were out of this. Yes. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1930.8s)]
*  And they complained about me. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1932.8s)]
*  So I started my career is that I started at the University of Glasgow, went to the University of Stirling for 10 years, then University of Strathclyde in Glasgow for eight years, then University of Bath. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1934.8s)]
*  Until 2012 to 2018, and I got the job in Bristol in 2018. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1946.8s)]
*  I started there in September. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1951.8s)]
*  And in the February, I gave a lecture for this course that I've been asked to teach called Harms of the Powerful, which is about state crimes and about corporate crime. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1954.8s)]
*  And one of the lectures I gave was about Islamophobia. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1964.8s)]
*  And I talked about this notion of the five pillars of Islamophobia, where part of one of the pillars is parts of the Zionist movement. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1966.8s)]
*  I phrased it like that. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1974.8s)]
*  We phrased it like that because we were we were focusing entirely at that stage on the concrete ways in which Zionist funders were engaged in funding key Islamophobic organizations, meaning both neoconservative think tanks, but also elements of the far right. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1975.8s)]
*  So we know, for example, the funding that's gone through the Middle East Forum in the US to Tommy Robinson's legal fees, et cetera, those kinds of funding connections, which are well known if you look. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=1996.8s)]
*  And so I talked about that, the parts of the Zionist movement. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2008.8s)]
*  And the CST objected to this. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2012.8s)]
*  They wrote in, they got a copy of one of the slides or some of the slides from our presentation from a couple of students who contacted them and honestly. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2013.8s)]
*  And they wrote in saying that that was not semite, but also that they were really very cross that that they claim that I had referred to them as being part of the Zionist movement, which is Islamophobia. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2023.8s)]
*  I had done no such thing. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2037.8s)]
*  And at that stage of the argument, I was I was saying nothing at all about the CST in relation to Islamophobia. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2039.8s)]
*  Now I might say something more about it now. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2045.8s)]
*  But at the time, all we were talking about was the empirical research we had at the time of the Zionist funders who funded, who have funded well known Islamophobic organizations in this country and in many other countries too. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2048.8s)]
*  We then went on to do more research where we looked at marriage sex, published some of this work, I think, which is excellent. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2063.8s)]
*  Hillary Ackhead has done the same thing. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2072.8s)]
*  I've done bits and pieces of it as well, where we find that many of the Zionist funders who had funded Islamophobia and Islamophobic activities, but had also, you know, big surprise, funded the settlements in the West Bank directly. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2074.8s)]
*  So they funded the specific settlements. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2089.8s)]
*  They funded the infrastructure of occupation through the IDF in the US. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2092.8s)]
*  It's called the Friends of the IDF in the in the UK. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2095.8s)]
*  It's called the Friends of the Association for the Wellbeing of Israel's Soldiers. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2098.8s)]
*  And it's tons of money going there. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2102.8s)]
*  And then, of course, they fund also some of the national institutions, the GNF, the WZO, et cetera. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2105.8s)]
*  And then, of course, they funded the WZO, the WZO, et cetera. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2112.8s)]
*  And then, of course, also NGOs, which are involved directly in settlement activity in East Jerusalem, such as, for example, the Jerusalem Foundation, tons of money going into that, which is engaged in effectively illegal activities across the Green Line. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2116.8s)]
*  So we started by saying some of the Zionist funders are funding Islamophobia. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2140.8s)]
*  And then we said, look, quite a lot of them are also funding illegal settlements. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2146.8s)]
*  And the CST didn't like this at all and wanted me to say that I was wrong and that the CST was not Islamophobic. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2150.8s)]
*  And of course, I wasn't saying that they were Islamophobic. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2157.8s)]
*  All I was saying was, you know, if these are the parts of the Zionist movement which are involved in funding Islamophobia, but more generally, this is what the Zionist movement is. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2159.8s)]
*  And they got that confused because they'd been reading slides and they conjectured what I must be saying and tried to get me sacked as a result. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2169.8s)]
*  And effectively, the complaint against them was thrown out straight away because they didn't have any locus. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2178.8s)]
*  They were a third party organization. They're not students. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2185.8s)]
*  It was said that the students themselves could complain even anonymously if they wanted to. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2188.8s)]
*  The students didn't want to, apparently. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2193.8s)]
*  And so that complaint was kicked out. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2195.8s)]
*  So the CST then, and let's remember that they don't like the idea that we say that they work together, but the CST then approached the Union of Jewish Students in London, which is the umbrella bodies like Hillel in the US. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2197.8s)]
*  In fact, the formal organization which runs the UGS is called the B'nai Barith Hillel Foundation in the US. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2212.8s)]
*  So you can see its origins. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2220.8s)]
*  And the UGS is the umbrella body for all the local Jewish societies, sometimes called Israel societies on campuses throughout the UK. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2223.8s)]
*  And they approached the UGS and said, look, you know, do you fancy writing a letter to complain about this Mueller chap? [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2233.8s)]
*  And they said, yeah, we'll do that. They wrote the letter and they rang up or emailed the president of Bristol JSOC and got her name to it as well. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2239.8s)]
*  And they then sent the complaint in and that was accepted because she was a student. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2249.8s)]
*  It wasn't accepted that UGS can't complain, but it was accepted because she was a student. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2253.8s)]
*  And if you look back at this, I mean, one day this will all become public, I guess. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2258.8s)]
*  But if you look back at the letter that they sent in, in complaint, remember I'd started in September 2018. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2263.8s)]
*  The lecture was in February 2019. In April they made their complaint. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2269.8s)]
*  And they complained about five things that I had said or written. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2274.8s)]
*  One of them had happened after September 2018, IE, when I was in post in Bristol. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2278.8s)]
*  All the rest had been from before that. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2283.8s)]
*  One they complained about was from 2013. It was an article we'd written about the Zionist movement in 2013, which they complained about. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2286.8s)]
*  Now, of course, this is preposterous. They can't be complaining about stuff which I'd written five years before I'd started working there. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2294.8s)]
*  And none of the stuff was to do with my work at Bristol. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2300.8s)]
*  And the other thing was all to do with public statements outside my work at Bristol. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2304.8s)]
*  And the policies of the university would have had no locus. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2307.8s)]
*  And in any case, it was a breach of the policies because a complaint is supposed to be taken within 90 days of the behaviour complained of. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2310.8s)]
*  And none of it was within 90 days. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2317.8s)]
*  And so the complaint was accepted. And then the university had meetings with the president of the JSOC, which UGS and CST people were present, incidentally. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2320.8s)]
*  I mean, extraordinarily. And the university encouraged them to submit more evidence. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2331.8s)]
*  And the single piece of evidence that they submitted, which was within the 90 days and which did relate to my teaching practice, was an essay question that I had set for the harm to the powerful course. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2337.8s)]
*  And the essay question was on the students were asked to have to give a critical analysis of the extent to which corporate lobbying was a form of corporate harm. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2351.8s)]
*  And it was submitted that this, while it didn't express any anti-Semitic tropes, might invite anti-Semitic tropes by way of answer. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2364.8s)]
*  I mean, that's a bit like when they accused Jeremy Corbyn of anti-Semitism because he had criticized banks. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2376.8s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2384.8s)]
*  It's like the person saying that has more questions to answer about anti-Semitism, I think. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2386.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2392.8s)]
*  So that complaint came in and that was rejected by the university at the first stage because it was manifestly ridiculous. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2393.8s)]
*  And then, I mean, just I'll try and get through this quickly, but then they appealed and the university then said to them, well, would you like to stop your appeal just now for a minute while we decide whether we introduce the IHRA definition? [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2401.8s)]
*  And they said, oh, yes, we'll do that. Thank you very much. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2413.8s)]
*  And then they lobbied, they lobbied for the IHRA definition to be brought in. The university was going to just take, adopt the definition and not the examples. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2415.8s)]
*  They had a demo outside of 15 kids and the university crumpled and adopted the full definition with all the examples. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2423.8s)]
*  And then they reactivated the complaint in January 2020 under the new rules. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2431.8s)]
*  So they changed the rules and that was apparently deemed fair. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2436.8s)]
*  Even after that, when they appointed a QC to investigate me, the QC found that none of my comments had engaged, had gone anywhere near the question of anti-Semitism or racism against Jews or harassment or any of the other, or breach of equality, all those things. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2440.8s)]
*  Very, very clear, total exoneration. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2458.8s)]
*  And that was a report which was submitted in December 2020. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2461.8s)]
*  And the university then decided it was going to think about publishing that and it produced a shortened version of that. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2466.8s)]
*  And then I gave a talk on the 13th of February, where I talked about having been attacked and complained about, that's the words I used, by the JSOC and by the UJS. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2473.8s)]
*  And that's when there was a big reaction to that statement. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2484.8s)]
*  And the university then decided it wasn't going to publish this report. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2488.8s)]
*  So I was in that position of being accused of anti-Semitism for my comments about being attacked and complained about, which is simply, of course, a factual statement. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2491.8s)]
*  And I wasn't able to say it actually. I've been entirely exonerated. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2500.8s)]
*  This is just absurd. So I was forced not to refer to this report, which was completely unfair. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2503.8s)]
*  I meant that it was open season on me and that any number of organizations, Zionist organizations, and if you count the numbers that did this, it was something like 15 or 16 different [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2510.8s)]
*  Zionist organizations, probably many more than most people know exist in the country, who complained about me. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2521.8s)]
*  And the APPG and anti-Semitism, that's the All-Party Parliamentary Group, the Zionist Federation, the JLC, the CST, etc. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2528.8s)]
*  And I was always fighting back against this with one arm behind my back. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2537.8s)]
*  And then after I made several statements in response to the press and wrote an article for Electronic Interfada, my first article for Electronic Interfada, then I was put under investigation by the university for my statements. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2542.8s)]
*  So I was unable to make any statements. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2558.8s)]
*  You were put under investigation by the university because you'd written an article for us. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2560.8s)]
*  That's part of the reason, yeah. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2565.8s)]
*  Oh, boy. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2567.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2568.8s)]
*  Wow. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2569.8s)]
*  I mean, they were looking for anything at this point. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2570.8s)]
*  Well, I mean, it sounds like collusion. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2572.8s)]
*  It sounds to me like the university colluded with the Israel lobby against you. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2575.8s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I'm not sure I would put that construction on it straightforwardly. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2584.8s)]
*  I mean, they don't have any conception that I've been subjected to effectively two years, by that stage, two years of harassment, bullying and intimidation, which would breach the university's own guidelines on harassment and bullying and which could have been turned into a complaint. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2589.8s)]
*  And so I mean, I've raised the issue of Kathleen Stock here because I see that she is a philosophy professor who has had what we might call gender critical views. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2610.8s)]
*  And the university has defended her academic freedom and said that that some of the activities against her has amounted to a campaign of harassment and bullying, which has included calls for her to be sacked. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2620.8s)]
*  Well, the University of Bristol could well have instituted an inquiry into the activities which were targeted against me, which was one, that they were calling for me to be sacked and two, they were defaming me by calling me a semi, which the university already knew was false because they had an expensive QC to determine that. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2634.8s)]
*  And they knew the results of that. But that's not how the university decided to respond. It's instead try to ignore the campaign of harassment and intimidation and try to focus just on the words that I said in February as the full amount of the crimes that I am supposed to answer for. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2656.8s)]
*  Yeah, so you've mentioned that the report from the QC, the report from the lawyer that the university mentioned in its, the university mentioned in its [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2679.8s)]
*  statement in which it fired you, it said that the report from the QC found that you had not said anything illegal. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2694.8s)]
*  But I mean, you've said to me that, and you've said again today that it's, it actually went further than that, and that it actually exonerated you of anti-Semitism. The university hasn't released that document. So you're saying the fact that they haven't released it is because simply that it exonerated you and they didn't want that to be the case. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2712.8s)]
*  Well, I mean, there are some things that I'm not, I can't, I'm not limited to say. I mean, actually, I'm not really at liberty to say that the report exonerated me of anti-Semitism. I've decided that I will be saying that because there is a public interest in me saying that because the university have given an account of what's in the report, which is not accurate in the sense that it says only the typing cleared of making unlawful statements. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2741.8s)]
*  So you have seen that report then? [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2768.8s)]
*  Yes. And let me be clear as well. You mentioned a report, but there isn't just one report. There are two reports. So when I was talking about the report submitted in December, this is a totally separate report from the report which was produced as a result of or after the statements I made in February. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2770.8s)]
*  So there are two separate reports by QC, both of them entirely exonerate me specifically about anti-Semitism and specifically of the question of harassment under the Equality Act 2010. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2789.8s)]
*  So this is not just a question of my statements being, being lawful, but specifically of there being no case to answer in terms of anti-Semitism. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2802.8s)]
*  And that's quite important for me for my reputation. But the problem, of course, is that people can't see these reports, that they remain secret. The university has refused to release them. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2811.8s)]
*  And they've refused even to tell the truth about what's in those reports, even to admit the existence of the first report and to tell the truth about what's in the second report. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2824.8s)]
*  You mentioned as well the article that you wrote for us. I'm very sorry to hear that I got you into trouble. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2835.8s)]
*  But it was an excellent article. And in the article in February you wrote for us that, quote, Britain is in the grip of an assault on its public sphere by the state of Israel and its advocates, unquote. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2845.8s)]
*  And I think it's fair to say that some on the left accused you of exaggerating. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2857.8s)]
*  But this month, when you were fired, the Jewish Chronicle, which is Britain's leading anti-Palestinian newspaper, they welcome your second with a front page story, but they weren't gleeful. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2863.8s)]
*  They sort of refused to accept yes for an answer, and they're demanding more. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2879.8s)]
*  And so the front page story is, quote, Miller is gone, but he is only the tip of the iceberg. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2884.8s)]
*  And the story listed some of the academics that have supported you at 74 separate British higher education bodies. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2892.8s)]
*  And it talks about more than 200 academics who've committed this terrible crime of signing a statement in support of you and your right to express your views against Zionism, Israel's settler colonial racist ideology. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2904.8s)]
*  So the paper's editorial also argued that, quote, Miller's sake should be the beginning and not the end. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2923.8s)]
*  So, you know, I mean, it looks to me like the Israel lobby is mounting a full blown attack on British universities. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2931.8s)]
*  And, you know, it really bears out what you wrote for us in the article about an assault on a public sphere by the state of Israel. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2938.8s)]
*  So, like, I mean, it looks to me like a full on, it's an attempt to mount a full on purge of British universities. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2947.8s)]
*  I mean, I mean, I don't want to exaggerate. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2957.8s)]
*  Like, I don't think they're going to be successful in getting everyone out they wanted to. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2962.8s)]
*  And it took, you know, they're complaining because it took them so long to get rid of you. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2966.8s)]
*  Right. They say the Jewish Chronicle is saying, we shouldn't we shouldn't accept this because, you know, Bristol has acted terribly because it took them, you know, the best part of a year to get rid of you or two years or however, whenever they're dating it from. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2973.8s)]
*  So, you know, I guess what I'm asking you is what do you think we can do to resist that? [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2993.8s)]
*  Like, how successful like how much how much of a victory is there is this for them? [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=2999.8s)]
*  And like, how successful are they going to be in attempting to purge British universities? [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3006.8s)]
*  Do you think? Well, I mean, let's be realistic. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3010.8s)]
*  As Nora mentioned at the beginning, this is something which is not unheard of in the US. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3015.8s)]
*  And, you know, there's lots of examples. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3020.8s)]
*  We can go back to Norman Finkelstein, but before Joseph Assad, Steve Suleyta, Mark Lamont Hill, you know, and the full cast of others. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3022.8s)]
*  And there's been many stories in the press in the last couple of months alone in Canada and in the US. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3029.8s)]
*  This is unprecedented in the UK. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3034.8s)]
*  And it's never happened before that any lobby group has managed to have any kind of managed to get rid of a member of staff who's a fully fledged professor. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3036.8s)]
*  But they have managed to stop an academic conference. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3049.8s)]
*  Oh, they've managed to do lots of things like that. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3052.8s)]
*  Yeah, this is this is unprecedented. Right. Yeah, definitely. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3054.8s)]
*  But it's not it's not I'm not alone. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3057.8s)]
*  So, I mean, while they've decided to target me, they don't like what the kind of things that I say and the research that I do and the facts that I find out they're doing elsewhere. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3059.8s)]
*  And I was involved in a meeting two nights ago where it became apparent that there have been, I think it was said, 30 complaints at the University of Warwick [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3070.8s)]
*  against something like 25 separate members of staff and students by UGS, JSOC related people. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3086.8s)]
*  And that's a huge assault on the University of Warwick, which had previously been through another complaint some years ago against Goldie Assure, which is a matter of public record. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3097.8s)]
*  And so that's another example. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3109.8s)]
*  There are cases in other universities, some of which I'm not aware of and I've only just heard about in the last few days. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3112.8s)]
*  But I know of cases in Birmingham, in Edinburgh, in Glasgow, in Leeds and in other places, too, where people have been complaining about some of them being complained about simply for tweeting in support of me. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3119.8s)]
*  And of course, there's been a whole set of trolls set to work on everyone who signed letters in support of me, such that there's a Twitter account called Tony Benn University, it's changed its name now, an anonymous Twitter account, which is effectively called for everyone who's signed letters in support of me to be sacked. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3134.8s)]
*  This is a disgraceful assault on academic freedom and attempt to intimidate members of staff from speaking out or even from holding views and expressing them in public about Palestine. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3156.8s)]
*  So this is a serious attack on academic freedom and academics. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3168.8s)]
*  But it's not only, I mean, the quote you gave there was about the public sphere. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3172.8s)]
*  I wasn't just talking about the universities, I'm talking about the schools, I'm talking about trade unions, I'm talking about local government. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3177.8s)]
*  It's the whole of the public sphere that they're going for. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3183.8s)]
*  We saw earlier this year in May with the assault on Gaza, the settler colonialism laid bare before everyone's eyes in the world. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3187.8s)]
*  And the schools, people in the schools in this country were kids were outraged and wanted to do things. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3197.8s)]
*  They wanted to raise money for the Palestinians or they wanted to demonstrate and support the Palestinians or they wanted to discuss the question in class. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3203.8s)]
*  And time after time, schools reacted in a way which tried to shut down debate. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3211.8s)]
*  So there was viral footage going around of kids walking out of school with Palestinian flags. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3216.8s)]
*  There's the stories of video footage of teachers appallingly telling kids off for wanting to raise the issue and accusing them of anti-Semitism with no evidence. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3221.8s)]
*  Even a case wasn't there of a teacher or a school insisting that money shouldn't go to the Palestinians, but should be divided between Israel and the Palestinians. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3233.8s)]
*  Truly extraordinary. So the schools is part of that as well. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3242.8s)]
*  And we see an assault backed up by the government. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3245.8s)]
*  So the government have tried to write to the university several times. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3249.8s)]
*  Robert Jenner did that, others did too, to try and have me sad. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3254.8s)]
*  But they've been doing the same with schools. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3258.8s)]
*  Well, Gavin Williamson, when he was education secretary, wrote to all schools asking them to have balanced debates on the Israel and Palestine and suggesting three organizations that the schools should bring into to have these debates. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3260.8s)]
*  CST, of course, was one of them. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3274.8s)]
*  But two others were organizations, which are both of which are scientist organizations and one of them has direct contacts and overlapping membership with the idea from the Israeli government. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3276.8s)]
*  I mean, truly extraordinary. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3286.8s)]
*  This is an assault on all the public sphere. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3288.8s)]
*  It's not just happening in this country. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3291.8s)]
*  It's been happening as no one knows too well in the US, but also in France and Germany. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3293.8s)]
*  I mean, there have been similar processes. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3297.8s)]
*  They tried out what they tried to get against Corbyn in France and Germany first. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3300.8s)]
*  They assault on De Linca in Germany and they assault on candidates, even candidates from right wing parties in France, who had to withdraw after they made statements about Palestine or BDS, [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3305.8s)]
*  which didn't meet the approval of the local affiliate of the Zionist movement in France. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3315.8s)]
*  So this is a very serious attempt to constrain public debate. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3320.8s)]
*  And the reason they're doing this is because they feel threatened because overwhelmingly public opinion in the world, including Jewish public opinion, is moving in the other direction away from supporting what happens in Israel and what Israel is doing to the Palestinians. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3325.8s)]
*  So they feel threatened and they feel the only thing they can do is to intimidate people from speaking out and have them sacked to stop people from speaking out. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3339.8s)]
*  You saw, you know, we see the Labour Party under Keir Starmer and the Labour Party leadership elections after Corbyn went and all of the candidates agreed to the Board of Deputies ridiculous 10 point program, [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3349.8s)]
*  which is a charter for the intimidation of the party. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3363.8s)]
*  And that's been very, very successful. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3368.8s)]
*  And they all agreed that they were Zionists. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3370.8s)]
*  They all agreed that they all said, oh, yeah, I'm a Zionist. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3373.8s)]
*  I was sorry, except for Keir Starmer, who said he was a supporter of Zionism without qualification. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3378.8s)]
*  But yet at the same time, even though lots of people, thousands of people left the party are being spelled. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3383.8s)]
*  Of course, I've left as well. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3389.8s)]
*  The the the conferences the other day overwhelmingly passed reasonably decent pro-Palestinian motion talking about Israel as an apartheid state, talking about boycott the rest of the sanctions, et cetera. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3391.8s)]
*  And so public opinion moves one direction while the elite level, which is what they're trying to do, they intimidate and they've captured the Labour Party. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3405.8s)]
*  They're trying to capture academia. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3415.8s)]
*  And, you know, I wouldn't I wouldn't say that they've got no chance of going further because they have got a chance of going further. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3417.8s)]
*  But the question is when people are have the confidence and institutions as a result of that have the confidence to fight back and to say no to this. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3424.8s)]
*  I think we're in the we're in the foothills of this. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3433.8s)]
*  This is the beginning. As the GC says, this is the beginning. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3435.8s)]
*  And they think that it's going to go all the way. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3438.8s)]
*  I'm afraid it's not. And we will win this. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3441.8s)]
*  But it might take us a little while to win this. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3444.8s)]
*  I mean, personally speaking, you know, I will be part of the winning of this. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3447.8s)]
*  I have been doing a lot of research over the last three years. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3452.8s)]
*  I have a lot of research ready to publish. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3456.8s)]
*  And there's much more coming on on the settlements on the Zionist movement itself, on the way in which it infiltrates different areas of public debate. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3459.8s)]
*  I mean, for example, in the interfaith industry, we are doing a lot of work on that. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3470.8s)]
*  And I know people on the left have smirked a bit at this. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3475.8s)]
*  So he thinks that even chicken soup is a Zionist plot when when a Zionist organization, interfaith organization, went to East London mosque and cooked chicken soup. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3478.8s)]
*  But I mean, you know, the thing is, it is a Zionist plot. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3489.8s)]
*  I mean, this is a Zionist organization trying to infiltrate the British Muslim community and to capture them, to normalize Zionism within the British Muslim community. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3492.8s)]
*  Because they recognize and their right to recognize that the Muslim community is a threat to to Israel's policies because the Muslim people. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3502.8s)]
*  And what happened in this country and it's also true in other countries, but in this country, especially after the invasion of Iraq and the run up to an end after the invasion of Iraq, we had a movement on the streets in this country, which united the left, the radical left and the Muslim community. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3510.8s)]
*  In a way we should never happen before. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3527.8s)]
*  And, you know, I would, you know, whenever I talk about this, I want to give all credit to the people in the stock of the war and in the Muslim Association of Britain who who made that breakthrough. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3529.8s)]
*  And it was Mab really who did it. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3539.8s)]
*  And if you look back at the history books, you can see that Mab said, look, this demonstration is going to be about Palestine. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3541.8s)]
*  And some of the people in the rest of the stock of the war, you know, people who for whom we all should have the most time and respect for Lindsay and John and Chris Nineham, etc. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3547.8s)]
*  They weren't necessarily keen on this and it won the day and it was the right decision. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3556.8s)]
*  And that was the moment where a new movement emerged, where it became apparent that the left could work with Muslims, that we could be united in front of that really terrified the denizens of the British secret state and indeed the science movement. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3561.8s)]
*  Because of course, you know, that's why they focus in particular on their two obsessions, which is left-wing anti-Semitism and Islamic anti-Semitism. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3577.8s)]
*  And these are these are things which are entirely concocted out of their imagination. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3587.8s)]
*  And a long period of concrete planning through the Global Forum for Countering Anti-Semitism, where if you look back at the events, the conferences started in 2007, they set it out very clearly what they're going to do, how they're going to target Muslims, how they're going to target the left. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3593.8s)]
*  How they're going to target Europe or Latin America, wherever. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3616.8s)]
*  There's a lot of material in those papers from those conferences, much of which, of course, is available for all you budding researchers on the Internet Archive. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3619.8s)]
*  And they've spent a lot of time and effort doing that. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3629.8s)]
*  They want to promote this idea that the red-green conspiracy theory, which they like, which some of the French intellectuals are into, not Batyour, of course, her Eurabia thesis that the Muslims are going to take over Europe. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3632.8s)]
*  And, you know, we can't do that. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3645.8s)]
*  We have to defend against the Muslims because they're going to outbreed us, et cetera. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3647.8s)]
*  And that's that stuff which comes from a Zionist conception of the world. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3650.8s)]
*  Batyour, of course, was herself an asset of Mossad, along with her husband David Lippmann, involved in the evacuation of Jews from Egypt back in the day. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3654.8s)]
*  So, I mean, this is a long-term strategy for them. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3667.8s)]
*  We shouldn't be scared of pointing out if we can show that it's the case, which when you do research, you can. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3672.8s)]
*  And I mean, to reiterate this, this is how I come to this from not from the point of view that the Zionists must be bad theoretically. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3679.8s)]
*  You know, I'm not opposed to theory. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3689.8s)]
*  You know, I make use of theory, but I come to this from empirical research. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3691.8s)]
*  And, you know, you follow the thread, you follow who does what, what the context of this is. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3695.8s)]
*  And you put that together into a better understanding of the world. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3700.8s)]
*  And once you do that, you start to see a whole lot of things which people are not aware of. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3704.8s)]
*  I saw quite a nice article today by Mike Wayne for Counterfire defending the idea that people should do research and might come up with things in the research which people find shocking because they don't know them. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3709.8s)]
*  And yet I find lots of things which are shocking. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3721.8s)]
*  And sometimes when I say to people about them, they are shocked because they don't know anything. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3724.8s)]
*  Oh, he must be making this up. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3728.8s)]
*  I saw someone the other day tweeting about me saying, well, his research is not evidence based. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3730.8s)]
*  I'm like, well, you know, of anyone who's doing research on this issue, I'm not the one you can say that of. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3735.8s)]
*  If there is anyone who's not doing evidence based research, I don't know who they are. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3742.8s)]
*  But certainly I'm not. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3745.8s)]
*  And all of the stuff I've been saying is evidence based. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3747.8s)]
*  And if you want me to give you the sources, I can give them to you. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3750.8s)]
*  I can point you to the sources. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3753.8s)]
*  And that's the thing which they they find very difficult to deal with. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3755.8s)]
*  I mean, the criticisms I've had from all of these organizations, the CST, for many others, these are criticisms which never engage in the factual questions. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3758.8s)]
*  Never. Never challenge the factual questions. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3768.8s)]
*  When people say to me, oh, well, you shouldn't have said that the UGS is a Zionist organization. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3770.8s)]
*  I say, well, why is that? [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3776.8s)]
*  The reason I say it's a Zionist organization is because it is. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3779.8s)]
*  It's formerly a member of the science movement. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3783.8s)]
*  In the structure I mentioned earlier, its constitution requires it to be pro-Israel. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3786.8s)]
*  It's a member of the World Union of Jewish Students, which it has an executive seat reserved, which, of course, is a member of the WZO. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3793.8s)]
*  And they can send delegates to the world to the Zionist Congress. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3799.8s)]
*  And even more than that, its core funding comes from the United Jewish Israel Appeal, the main fundraising body for Israel in the UK, which, of course, as many people won't know, is the UK affiliate of Keren Hazard, one of the four national institutions based in National Institutions House in Israel. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3802.8s)]
*  All this stuff sounds complicated and there's lots of different organizations and it's difficult to get your head around. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3818.8s)]
*  Yeah, I get that. But, you know, these things are facts. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3824.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3827.8s)]
*  David, we only have a couple minutes left. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3829.8s)]
*  I wanted to ask you about, you know, the appeal and how people can support you. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3832.8s)]
*  But first, before you answer that, if you could talk a little bit about what your advice would be and is for other scholars, you know, students, activists, [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3839.8s)]
*  who are facing threats and smear campaigns by the Israel lobby and the Zionist movements. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3851.8s)]
*  What is your advice to them as they see what's happening to you? [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3858.8s)]
*  Well, I mean, it would be foolish of me to say, you know, do what I did because look where I ended. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3864.8s)]
*  But, you know, in the end, all we have to defend ourselves is the truth. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3871.8s)]
*  And, you know, we need to be telling the truth and showing the evidence that it is the truth. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3880.8s)]
*  That means us writing and debating more. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3886.8s)]
*  And I think there are debates to be had on the left as well, you know, about the extent to which, you know, [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3889.8s)]
*  We should confine our talk about Israel to the apartheid regime of Israel or settler colonialism or Zionism being racism. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3894.8s)]
*  But I think it's very important that we understand that Zionism is an actually existing thing happening in our politics. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3901.8s)]
*  And it will continue to do so unless, until and unless we, to use the words that are used on the University of Bristol, [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3909.8s)]
*  a statement about the Black Lives Matter protests until we eradicate and dismantle racism, [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3917.8s)]
*  which means, of course, eradicating and dismantling Zionism as an ideology. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3923.8s)]
*  And just to be clear about that, I'm not suggesting dismantling Zionism as an ideology in the sense of physical violence. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3927.8s)]
*  Talking about the ideas, how the conditions are underlying the existence of Zionism as an ideology. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3935.8s)]
*  In the same ways that we talked about dismantling apartheid, the ideology of apartheid is more or less gone now. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3943.8s)]
*  The ideology of pro-Semitism in the 26 counties to the south of Ireland doesn't exist anymore. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3951.8s)]
*  70 or 80 years ago, it was a very strong ideology. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3959.8s)]
*  It only exists in the north still because, let's not get into the north north question, [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3963.8s)]
*  but this is about dismantling an ideology. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3969.8s)]
*  And the same ways we would talk about dismantling racism. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3973.8s)]
*  Racism is not just a set of ideas. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3976.8s)]
*  It has material forms in the practices that it requires and that it uses to reproduce itself. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3979.8s)]
*  If you want to dismantle Islamophobia as a form of racism, you have to dismantle the counterterrorism apparatus. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3986.8s)]
*  Just in the same way, if you want to dismantle and eradicate Zionism, [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3992.8s)]
*  you have to dismantle the apparatus which puts it in place and that's the organizations which do that. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=3997.8s)]
*  So yes, that's what I would say. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=4003.8s)]
*  I would say we have to defend ourselves with the truth and by doing more evidence-based research, [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=4006.8s)]
*  I will do more of that. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=4011.8s)]
*  I want other people to be involved in it. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=4012.8s)]
*  There are lots of other people doing research like this. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=4014.8s)]
*  Let's get that research out there and let's reassure those bodies who can defend us, [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=4017.8s)]
*  the trade unions and indeed the universities that they can make statements like the University of Sussex has made [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=4026.8s)]
*  in relation to the question of gender critical philosopher. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=4032.8s)]
*  And that would be appropriate. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=4037.8s)]
*  It does mean that you have to say that these are not just Jewish student groups, [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=4040.8s)]
*  groups of Jewish students. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=4046.8s)]
*  These are groups which have a particular political agenda. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=4048.8s)]
*  We need to understand that. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=4051.8s)]
*  Otherwise, all that will happen is they will say around the country, [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=4053.8s)]
*  oh, I'm hurt by someone saying something against Zionists. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=4058.8s)]
*  That's not good enough. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=4061.8s)]
*  That's not a way to move towards a proper debate about Israel and Palestine. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=4063.8s)]
*  And give us the info on the Support David Miller campaign and what the next step is. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=4069.8s)]
*  So the next step for me is an appeal in the university process. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=4077.8s)]
*  And then after that, if that fails, then there's an employment tribunal and there are other potential legal avenues [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=4081.8s)]
*  which I'm exploring with my legal advisors. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=4089.8s)]
*  The Support Miller campaign is at supportmiller.org. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=4093.8s)]
*  And you can go and have a look at the material there. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=4097.8s)]
*  And there are things that you can do. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=4100.8s)]
*  Of course, there's that petition that's flying around with the 20,000 signatories. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=4102.8s)]
*  I think that's kind of quite dramatic, the number of people who have signed that, especially compared to, for example, [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=4107.8s)]
*  the petitions from earlier in the year which were calling for me to be signed, [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=4114.8s)]
*  which had less than half of that number. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=4117.8s)]
*  And we're only at the stage of it still increasing. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=4120.8s)]
*  So there's lots of things people can do. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=4123.8s)]
*  And I'm more than happy to help people to work out what the best thing to do is they can contact me on my email, which is available online. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0yyPiRg5Gk&t=4126.8s)]
