# Why does Israel seek to destroy UNRWA? with Lex Takkenberg | EI Podcast
**The Electronic Intifada:** [March 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4)
*  Hello and welcome back to the Electronic Intifada podcast. I'm Nora Barrows-Freedman. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=0.0s)]
*  Immediately after the International Court of Justice's ruling on January 26th that Israel [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=4.88s)]
*  is plausibly committing acts of genocide in Gaza, Israel baselessly accused a handful of employees [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=10.88s)]
*  of the UN Agency for Palestine Refugees, UNRWA, of participating in the October 7th operation, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=17.76s)]
*  using alleged confessions that were likely obtained under torture of Palestinian detainees. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=24.639999999999997s)]
*  Nevertheless, as our audience knows, the United States pulled its funding of UNRWA, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=30.959999999999997s)]
*  prompting more than 16 countries to do the same. Slowly, some of those countries and UN member [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=36.0s)]
*  organizations, including Canada, Sweden, the European Union, and this week Australia, have [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=42.4s)]
*  restored some of that funding. But the United States, in a bipartisan effort, continues to [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=48.32s)]
*  refuse to refund the agency that provides a humanitarian lifeline to Palestinians not just [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=53.84s)]
*  in Gaza, but refugees in the occupied West Bank, Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon. Joining us to talk [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=59.84s)]
*  about this is Lex Tachenberg. Lex is a senior advisor with the Arab Renaissance for Democracy [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=66.64s)]
*  and Development and a lecturer at the Institute of International Humanitarian Affairs at Fordham [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=72.16s)]
*  University. For decades, Lex worked at the UN Agency for Palestine Refugees, UNRWA, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=77.67999999999999s)]
*  as the first chief of the ethics office and he held other positions at the agency as well. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=84.08s)]
*  Lex Tachenberg, it's a pleasure to have you with us today on the Electronic and Davada podcast. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  Great being with you. Thank you for the opportunity. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=95.11999999999999s)]
*  Thank you so much. You worked for decades at the agency and held a position, as I mentioned, of [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=98.88s)]
*  chief of ethics. Let's start by having you talk about the ethics involved in the agency's [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=105.68s)]
*  handling of these accusations. UNRWA fired five of their employees who were accused of being [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=112.08000000000001s)]
*  involved in the October 7th attacks. Can you talk about how you might have handled this? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=117.76s)]
*  Well, like all other UN system organizations, UNRWA has a setup for dealing with both raising [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=122.96s)]
*  awareness of the ethical and legal standards, the standards of conduct required of personnel, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=137.84s)]
*  as well as how to respond when there are concerns about violations of those standards. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=145.68s)]
*  This includes a department of internal oversight services with an investigation division, with an [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=153.44s)]
*  evaluation division, with an audit and inspection department, and also, and this is a separate sort [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  of standalone function, there is an ethics office and there is also an ombuds office to deal with [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=171.44s)]
*  different aspects of grievances and ethical concerns. So I've been heading, I've been setting [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=177.84s)]
*  up and heading the UNRWA ethics office starting in late 2009 when an instruction had been issued that [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=184.16s)]
*  all different UN organizations coming under the authority of the General Assembly and Secretary [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=193.68s)]
*  General of the UN were required to set up an ethics function. The ethics function is primarily [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=204.4s)]
*  dealing sort of with preventing ethical breaches. So when I, during my tenure, I was heavily involved [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=210.96s)]
*  in training and also providing guidance to individual staff on sort of the standard of [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=220.56s)]
*  conduct, including the humanitarian principles and in particular also the principle of neutrality [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=227.60000000000002s)]
*  that is so critical for UNRWA's work and is under such scrutiny in UNRWA's case. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=238.56s)]
*  So one example, for example, was the development of a very comprehensive ethics online course on [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=247.84s)]
*  social media and neutrality to train all UNRWA personnel from the commissioner general to even [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=256.32s)]
*  junior staff in both international staff and Palestinian staff in English and Arabic about [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=264.08s)]
*  sort of the requirements that neutrality, the principle of neutrality implied and also how to [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=273.12s)]
*  apply that in a social media context. What it entails for social media, what it entails for [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=280.08s)]
*  management of agencies installation, what it entails for employees sort of political engagement [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=287.84s)]
*  or non-engagement and for the neutrality of sort of the operations neutrality of [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=294.24s)]
*  of vehicles and warehousing and so forth. So that was more the role of the ethics office. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=302.88000000000005s)]
*  In terms of allegations of breaches of the standards of conduct, whether it relates to [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=313.20000000000005s)]
*  corruption, whether it relates to personal misconduct, sexual abuse or whether it relates [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=320.32000000000005s)]
*  to neutrality breaches and such as the one that were alleged by Israel following the ICJ ruling, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=326.48s)]
*  they would normally go through the Department of Internal Oversight Services and in particular [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=336.48s)]
*  to its investigation division. Now in the case of these most recent allegations because of the [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=342.0s)]
*  gravity of the matter and because of the fact that it immediately triggered [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=348.72s)]
*  a significant number of donors to suspend funding, UNRWA requested the secretariat and in particular [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=357.36s)]
*  the Office of Internal Oversight Services to take over that investigation to have sort of [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=366.72s)]
*  further arms lengths between the agency and the investigation and these serious allegations and [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=372.4s)]
*  so that is what happened and as we know OIOS did open an investigation, it sent its investigators [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=378.47999999999996s)]
*  down to Amman to sort of look at the allegations as they had been shared with UNRWA's commissioner [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=390.4s)]
*  general and then OIOS invited Israel to share further evidence because Israel had shared [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=396.4s)]
*  the allegations but not the evidence on which the allegations were based and my understanding [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=406.15999999999997s)]
*  is that until this moment and in spite of repeated reminders Israel has not been forced coming in [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=413.35999999999996s)]
*  sharing that information and that was one of the triggers that has also prompted a number of [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=419.59999999999997s)]
*  of donor countries to realize that their suspension had been premature and have prompted [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=426.56s)]
*  them to resume funding. In addition to the ones you mentioned I just got word that also Iceland [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=436.88s)]
*  has today resumed its funding. Thanks for that and you know I mean these countries Sweden, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=443.12s)]
*  Iceland now Australia, Canada you know they've kind of slowly started this refunding but the [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=454.88s)]
*  US's decision to defund UNRWA which was you know the first domino of that domino effect [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=462.88s)]
*  you know had the Democrats and Republicans have been working hand in hand together to [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=469.76s)]
*  keep starving Palestinians in Gaza by not just defunding UNRWA but providing cover for Israel's [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=478.08s)]
*  you know ongoing blockade. They're not allowing or you know they're not demanding that Israel [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=487.36s)]
*  open the crossings to let these thousands of aid trucks in. What do you make of the US's role [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=495.76s)]
*  in all of this as it pertains to UNRWA? Well it is in a number of ways sort of surprising and [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=505.6s)]
*  quite shocking but there has been a history of extreme scrutiny by the US Congress of [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=519.2s)]
*  of the American of the State Department support to UNRWA so in that sense it is [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=529.12s)]
*  not so surprising. There have been a number of reviews by the Government Accountability Office, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=537.28s)]
*  the Congress's independent oversight body into use of American funding by UNRWA [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=544.8s)]
*  and that has time and again resulted in glowing evaluations that UNRWA is doing everything in its [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=558.3199999999999s)]
*  power to make sure that that funding is appropriately used and no American contributions [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=567.04s)]
*  or other donor contributions for that matter are inappropriately directed to potentially to [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=576.64s)]
*  terrorist or terrorist activity. So it's in that sense yeah it is quite shocking. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=583.68s)]
*  Today Haaretz contains quite a prominent report raising a detailed story by an Israeli social media [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=590.8s)]
*  watchdog I think fake report that had revealed that immediately after the ICJ ruling a series of [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=606.32s)]
*  sort of a coordinated media influencing digital media influencing operation had been [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=620.1600000000001s)]
*  targeted exclusively on sort of the allocate to amplify the allegations against UNRWA [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=627.2800000000001s)]
*  vis-a-vis members of Congress and the Senate and especially younger members of Congress [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=634.32s)]
*  and this entails hundreds and hundreds of fake accounts and bots and other [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=644.88s)]
*  sort of fake personas that were automatically responding and reacting with tweets by a large [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=655.6s)]
*  number of younger members of Congress especially from the Democratic Party so there has been a [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=665.36s)]
*  party so there has been a sustained attempt at sowing mayhem amongst key [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=672.88s)]
*  influences in the Congress to sustain this defunding and the scope of it was quite [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=685.04s)]
*  dramatically exposed by Haaretz today. What we see I mean I left UNRWA four years ago [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=696.16s)]
*  after having been three decades with the organization in a wide range of positions so [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=704.48s)]
*  I've seen many sort of Israeli-led attacks on the agency and I also want to recall that it was [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=709.68s)]
*  Israel itself immediately even during the Six-Day War that requested UNRWA to continue its [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=717.04s)]
*  operations. I mean Israel realized that if it would not ask UNRWA to do so then it would have [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=725.44s)]
*  to as an occupying power take responsibility for those services for those basic services itself so [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=731.2800000000001s)]
*  it was Israel that asked UNRWA to continue. There have been [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=738.4000000000001s)]
*  nevertheless you know since already the 19 late 1960s and early 1970s frequent attacks [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=746.0s)]
*  on the agency but never at such an existential level. One of the problems that we have [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=752.64s)]
*  that I have experienced and many UNRWA colleagues have experienced that you know these allegations [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=763.6s)]
*  initially sort of sound very serious if you don't know the background and the context [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=771.92s)]
*  and the pattern of which they have been sort of you know the influencing the media influencing [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=777.36s)]
*  campaign of which they are part and so there is a constant turnover in members of parliaments of [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=785.28s)]
*  donor countries and constantly there is a need to re-educate new members of congress, new parliamentarians [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=792.48s)]
*  in different countries who sort of jump on some of those issues especially those for more sort of [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=801.36s)]
*  right wing from a more right wing signature and I think that's part of it of what is at play at [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=806.4s)]
*  at the moment in the US context as well so it's very saddening. I understand this week or the [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=814.88s)]
*  coming week will be the expropriation bill and one of the biggest concerns is language that [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=825.52s)]
*  would sort of permanently prevent UNRWA from receiving US funding. I mean I hope really [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=835.12s)]
*  really sincerely hope that this can be prevented. I mean as I mentioned UNRWA is an instrument [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=842.72s)]
*  that Israel itself welcomed and in many ways continue to welcome although what has characterized [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=851.68s)]
*  earlier attacks on UNRWA were clearly targeted towards diverting attention away from certain [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=860.6400000000001s)]
*  unfavorable publicity that UNRWA was sort of expecting and that was clearly I think also the [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=868.1600000000001s)]
*  intention with respect to the sort of the bombshell on the 26th of January coinciding with the ICJ [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=874.5600000000001s)]
*  ruling but what we now see is the effect of the extreme right wing coalition that thinks well [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=881.7600000000001s)]
*  UNRWA is a manifestation of the international community's permanent responsibility for the [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=887.84s)]
*  unresolved question of Palestine including the refugee issue and if we do away with UNRWA [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=895.76s)]
*  that suits our Zionist agenda so I think it has sort of got overboard and I even believe that [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=904.1600000000001s)]
*  Nathan Yahu who normally would sort of if things were going too far vis-a-vis UNRWA would sort of [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=915.9200000000001s)]
*  you know say okay now it's enough and we need UNRWA otherwise we have to take over these [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=921.9200000000001s)]
*  responsibilities ourselves and at the moment it's sort of spinning out of control and the same seems [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=927.36s)]
*  to happen in the United States. Yeah let's talk a little bit more about that. You were talking [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=932.32s)]
*  about the the decades of efforts by Israel to dismantle UNRWA even though as you said during [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=940.96s)]
*  the 1967 war it was happy not to have the financial burden of you know that that Israel is obliged [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=946.64s)]
*  to you know to have in terms of its responsibility towards the occupied people as an occupying power. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=956.8000000000001s)]
*  What do you think is at the heart of this effort to wipe UNRWA out or shift responsibilities? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=964.8000000000001s)]
*  You know we now see some talk by Israeli leaders saying that UNRWA should be dissolved and the UN [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=972.32s)]
*  High Commissioner for Refugees should be the administrative agency for Palestinians. Why are [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=979.2800000000001s)]
*  they so intent of getting rid of UNRWA specifically? Well I mentioned there has been this pattern of [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=986.88s)]
*  criticism for almost since 67 but it's only recently and with the current Israeli government [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=995.2s)]
*  that it is really at the level of sort of trying to erase UNRWA or preventing UNRWA from continuing [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1003.04s)]
*  to operate at least in Gaza and the West Bank but ideally also in the rest of the areas where it [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1009.6s)]
*  works. Until recently I feel that criticism on UNRWA was to as an instrument of sort of [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1016.4s)]
*  criticizing the UN. Part of Israel's frustration was the broader UN and then UNRWA sort of Israel [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1029.92s)]
*  quite rapidly discovered after 67 that UNRWA was sort of the I would say the sometimes I call it [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1038.48s)]
*  the weak underbelly of the UN system was 99% of its employees being Palestinian recruited [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1044.96s)]
*  and therefore part and part of the unresolved situation. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1053.2s)]
*  An organization that is very operational and that operates in a very volatile environment so easy to [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1063.28s)]
*  criticize including for sort of neutrality breaches, anti-Semitism. The first thing that [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1069.84s)]
*  Israel discovered after 67 was sort of the tech book issue. Israel itself after 67 was responsible [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1075.76s)]
*  for the education system for non-refugee Palestinian children in the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip so [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1085.04s)]
*  it discovered that the schools were using Egyptian and Jordanian textbooks and as they typically do [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1093.44s)]
*  textbooks including the Israeli textbooks reflect sort of the state of affairs and the state of [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1101.76s)]
*  peace or lack thereof between a country issuing the textbook and its neighbors so there was [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1107.52s)]
*  objectionable content in those textbooks and rather than sort of taking that up with Egypt or [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1114.16s)]
*  and with Jordan it saw that it would take it would criticize UNRWA for using those textbooks [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1120.88s)]
*  and then there was a whole scandal UNESCO had to be involved there was a whole censorship committee [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1129.92s)]
*  set up and each and every textbook had to be censored essentially by the Israelis before it [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1135.44s)]
*  could be used in the schools and that process essentially that sort of scrutiny of textbooks [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1141.1200000000001s)]
*  is continuing until the present moment when the Palestinian Authority was established it started [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1148.08s)]
*  issuing textbooks even these came under scrutiny and then eventually UNRWA as part of its response [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1153.12s)]
*  and also as part of the scrutiny that came from the US and the government accountability office [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1161.92s)]
*  set up a curriculum framework and set up its own review of textbooks in a way its own sort [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1169.68s)]
*  of censorship it could not technically censor the textbooks because they were issued by the [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1178.3999999999999s)]
*  sovereign host countries in which it operated so it had to respect them in that sense but it looked [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1184.1599999999999s)]
*  at the content and if there was objectionable content UNRWA would issue enrichment materials [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1190.96s)]
*  and a teacher guide to instruct its teachers to you know use to not use specific pages and [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1197.2s)]
*  teach alternative content and that again has been praised by many educational professionals [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1206.4s)]
*  that UNRWA is having such a sorrow arrangement in place and it UNRWA extended it not just to [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1214.16s)]
*  content objectionable on the basis of neutrality but also on sort of gender stereotyping and other [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1221.84s)]
*  inappropriate content not sort of in line with sort of UN values so that's just one example of [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1231.12s)]
*  criticism that started very early on but that never triggered it was always a [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1240.24s)]
*  a measure to keep UNRWA and the UN on its toes but it was never sort of threatened for UNRWA to [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1249.1200000000001s)]
*  sort of stop operations I mentioned social media after the the 2014 war was the first war that [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1255.92s)]
*  really played out on social media and at that time a number of pro-israeli monitoring groups [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1265.92s)]
*  sort of scrutinized the use by UNRWA's local personnel of social media account in particular [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1275.12s)]
*  Facebook and then there were those staff that had very low privacy settings and they were occasionally [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1282.0s)]
*  called by posting content that was sort of seen as as glorifying armed resistance or [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1287.76s)]
*  or would be interpreted as being anti-semitic so that again put UNRWA in a corner and set up this [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1294.6399999999999s)]
*  effort that I mentioned earlier to develop very rigid very solid social media training [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1302.48s)]
*  both online and in person so that gives you a sort of a flavor of sort of the kind of [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1310.0800000000002s)]
*  text that UNRWA received what we're currently witnessing I mean and occasionally in those debates [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1318.3200000000002s)]
*  people from both sides both Palestinians and more more radical Zionist groups were saying you know [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1326.1599999999999s)]
*  let's close UNRWA down and let UNHCR take it over Palestinians sometimes thought that UNHCR would be [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1337.04s)]
*  more vocal in advocating for refugee rights that UNRWA was not so explicit on protection [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1344.6399999999999s)]
*  as UNHCR and for Zionist groups UNHCR they mistakenly believe that UNHCR [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1353.92s)]
*  is focusing more on resettlement of refugees in certain countries which is a misinterpretation [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1363.84s)]
*  because UNHCR focuses on the three main durable solutions which is when possible return, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1372.8s)]
*  voluntary repatriation, if that is not possible local integration in countries of asylum in host [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1383.2s)]
*  countries and if also that is not possible resettlement in certain countries and that is [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1389.6s)]
*  not different from UNHCR is not different from what UNRWA or what has been sort of urged by [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1401.52s)]
*  the General Assembly with respect to Palestinian refugees originally in resolution 194 on the [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1412.96s)]
*  on sort of the urging that the refugees could return to their original homes so mistaken [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1418.72s)]
*  belief about what UNRWA oh sorry what UNHCR could and could not do also a mistaken [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1425.8400000000001s)]
*  perception that it was also argued that UNRWA registered sort of the subsequent generations [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1434.88s)]
*  were now in the fifth generation of Palestinian refugees that UNRWA registered the the subsequent [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1441.7600000000002s)]
*  generations and UNHCR is not doing that that's also incorrect UNHCR also as guided by the sort [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1448.0s)]
*  of the principle of unity of the family is giving the same legal status and therefore also registers [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1459.12s)]
*  descendants of the of the original refugees however with respect to UNHCR's caseload [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1470.16s)]
*  the refugees refugee hold it generally doesn't last that long you know it doesn't typically [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1477.1200000000001s)]
*  continue until the fifth generation but there are exceptions i mean the Afghani refugee crisis is [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1485.2s)]
*  also already in its third or fourth generation so and there UNHCR acts exactly in the same the same [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1490.72s)]
*  as UNRWA does so a lot of misperceptions now after 7 October when really the mainstream when [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1497.76s)]
*  when the extremist Zionist agenda that until 15 months ago was the onset of the current Israeli [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1509.2s)]
*  government was sort of on the fringes when that had rapidly become mainstream and in particular [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1518.88s)]
*  after 7 October you know if there were still reservations about Schmottrich and Ben Gwir [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1525.2s)]
*  and so forth their thinking became mainstream after after 7 October so in that context [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1531.44s)]
*  and I mentioned earlier UNRWA is a manifestation and a continued existence of UNRWA [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1539.28s)]
*  is a manifestation of the unresolved permanent international responsibility for the question of [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1546.64s)]
*  Palestine when when the UN started engaging on the Palestinian question recommended the partition [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1554.0s)]
*  of Palestine in in the historic Palestine in two states the the self-determination or the the [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1565.92s)]
*  the realization of the state of Israel was was achieved of the Jewish state was achieved and [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1576.32s)]
*  the Palestinian state was never was never was never materialized and and that has resulted in [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1581.84s)]
*  in permanent responsibility by the international community towards the Palestinian people of of [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1591.9199999999998s)]
*  doing so and and and UNRWA is the is the most tangible manifestation of that of that of that [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1598.1599999999999s)]
*  obligation so you know rather than rather than dealing with the underlying problem or the [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1606.24s)]
*  underlying situation sort of focusing on the symbols of that of that responsibility of that [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1614.16s)]
*  unresolved refugeehood seems to be a strategy that that that Israeli mainstream has has now embraced [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1620.64s)]
*  that's why the recent attacks on UNRWA have gone have gone much further than the the the [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1631.3600000000001s)]
*  the previous one during the previous decades that I that I mentioned. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1640.96s)]
*  Yeah. Lex Tachenberg, after so many years of underfunding and now defunding UNRWA, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1644.96s)]
*  how close do you believe the agency is to total collapse? [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1653.2s)]
*  Well, UNRWA has been a valuable instrument of the international community for indeed [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1656.72s)]
*  exercising some of that responsibility that I just referred to. I also want to recall that [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1668.8799999999999s)]
*  it was the Americans, the US government, that was behind the creation of UNRWA because they saw as [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1675.52s)]
*  chair of the Consolidation Commission for Palestine that that was set up after the [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1682.96s)]
*  assassination of Count Bernadotte that refugee return was was not that likely to happen and they [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1688.32s)]
*  were starting to look for alternatives in particular through sort of the second best [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1697.6000000000001s)]
*  durable solution, local integration, and they needed an agency to to to sort of to to to [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1703.28s)]
*  to to sort of facilitate that and that became UNRWA. That's the works in UNRWA's name, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1711.2s)]
*  large-scale public's work schemes actually models on the Tennessee Valley authority in the US. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1718.0800000000002s)]
*  So so that's that's that's about that's about UNRWA's UNRWA's origins. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1728.0s)]
*  As for whether UNRWA is close to collapse, it's very clear that Israel is making things very very [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1741.3600000000001s)]
*  difficult. I was earlier today in the media and I'm commenting that I believe the attacks on UNRWA, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1750.88s)]
*  especially in Gaza, but you know as an extension thereof also in the in the West Bank and in East [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1760.0s)]
*  Jerusalem can be seen as a as an integral element of Israel's genocide towards the Palestinians in [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1767.28s)]
*  Gaza. I mean UNRWA represents a huge you can say social protection infrastructure with its schools, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1776.56s)]
*  its health centers, its social work system, its psychosocial support, its micro finance, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1784.96s)]
*  its infrastructure work, and and all the related people and and support structures. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1793.28s)]
*  So it's it's one element of making the continued survival of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1804.16s)]
*  impossible. So I think that is and and and indeed it is very much to be seen. I don't think that [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1811.68s)]
*  UNRWA in Gaza will be back to business as usual once there is a permanent ceasefire. I think too [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1819.28s)]
*  much has been destroyed. Too many other actors have also entered the scene which I think is is [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1826.8799999999999s)]
*  important. So I believe I believe the UNRWA operation in Gaza needs to be redesigned in [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1835.68s)]
*  in light of the realities and the context in which reconstruction is going to happen. Is it [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1842.56s)]
*  going to happen you know in all of the Gaza Strip? Is it what what what are we going to [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1848.4s)]
*  witness? So it's too early. In terms of UNRWA as a as an organization, first it is the General [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1853.3600000000001s)]
*  Assembly that created UNRWA in a majority resolution of the General Assembly and it's also the General [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1862.48s)]
*  Assembly that is the only body that can formally and legally dismantle the agency and I don't think [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1869.68s)]
*  there is any chance of that of that of that happening UNRWA remains too important also in [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1876.8s)]
*  the other four areas where it operates. I think yeah it's very critical to see what will happen [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1884.1599999999999s)]
*  in the US and I'm I'm very worried about that but I hope I hope also the US will realize [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1893.76s)]
*  you know what an important instrument UNRWA remains at the disposal of the international [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1902.56s)]
*  community. I mean it's not an organization that came falling out of the air. It was a program [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1908.8s)]
*  created by the General Assembly by the international community to to exercise some of its [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1913.28s)]
*  responsibilities. So I hope sort of also their reason will prevail. We have seen after the [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1919.2s)]
*  Trump attack on UNRWA in early 2018 that other donors stepped up the plate. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1929.28s)]
*  Gulf countries, Germany dramatically increased its contribution. So I believe that somehow UNRWA is [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1936.48s)]
*  too important to to let to let go down. There may be reasons for for indeed a change of some of the [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1943.28s)]
*  modus operandi. I mean UNRWA has always been involved in this direct service delivery [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1954.3999999999999s)]
*  directly operating a parallel school system, a parallel health care system. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1963.04s)]
*  If Gaza needs to be rebuilt as a society it could well be that you know there is one [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1968.96s)]
*  Palestinian education system and health system in the Gaza Strip that that you know where UNRWA's [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1974.6399999999999s)]
*  expertise and manpower is integrated but which does not necessarily need to be operated by UNRWA. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1981.44s)]
*  I mean it is a bit of an old-fashioned concept and not repeated by UNHCR and other humanitarian [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1989.44s)]
*  agencies to sort of you know direct implement these programs. What I would like to see is that [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=1995.28s)]
*  UNRWA is addressing the protection vacuum and in particular the durable solutions vacuum [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2002.8s)]
*  that was left by the by the demise or the disappearance of the UN Consolidation Commission [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2013.28s)]
*  for Palestine which was responsible amongst other things for the right of return, for the right of [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2025.9199999999998s)]
*  restitution, for compensation. I have been advocating for UNRWA to reinterpret its mandate [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2030.08s)]
*  to include the pursuit of durable solutions not just return and restitution and compensation [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2040.0s)]
*  but also more forcefully local integration for those refugees where that is an option. I mean in [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2050.24s)]
*  Lebanon the state the legal status and the factual conditions of Palestinians are horrific and [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2056.56s)]
*  there is much advocacy needed to improve that and with the economic crisis in Lebanon there are also [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2067.84s)]
*  there's also leverage by the international community to sort of force Lebanon to change [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2076.96s)]
*  its attitude. There are also Palestinians who do seek resettlement in certain countries. There were [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2082.24s)]
*  Palestinian refugees from Syria fleeing to Lebanon who saw that UNHCR you know was taking [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2089.92s)]
*  vulnerable refugees from Syria people with disabilities with chronic diseases would qualify [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2099.7599999999998s)]
*  for resettlement in certain countries with UNHCR's help and because UNRWA interpreted its mandate as [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2106.32s)]
*  excluding durable solutions and Palestinian refugees are in UNRWA's area of operation are [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2113.2000000000003s)]
*  outside UNHCR's mandate those Palestinians would not qualify for similar treatment and so I [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2119.84s)]
*  I have been advocating and I hope to to see opportunities to realize this for UNRWA taking a [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2129.52s)]
*  more holistic and comprehensive approach to its protection function also working to upgrade its [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2136.16s)]
*  its registration records to which it is making already a tremendous a tremendous effort at the [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2145.2s)]
*  moment it's one of the one of the unsung highlights of UNRWA's work at the at the moment [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2150.8s)]
*  potentially linking it to the property records that the UNCCP left behind when it ceased operations [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2158.5600000000004s)]
*  in 1965 these records are all still available if those records of UNRWA are linked with the [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2165.2000000000003s)]
*  the property data that pertaining to the refugees and then we have a we have a [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2173.44s)]
*  a powerful resource to sort of you know for future reparations for future restitution claims and so [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2180.7999999999997s)]
*  forth that that that UNRWA could could undertake and potentially the sort of the UNRWA taking a [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2187.92s)]
*  bigger distance vis-a-vis the U.S. and and and some other member states may create a political [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2197.76s)]
*  space for the for the agency to to to embark on that so it's too early to see but you know [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2205.6800000000003s)]
*  there are definitely there's definitely a direction that I think UNRWA can take [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2212.0800000000004s)]
*  in in in light of the situation that we are witnessing yeah and just for our audiences clarity [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2217.6800000000003s)]
*  what is what was the UNCCP and why why was it important to to understand in this context [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2227.36s)]
*  when when UNRWA sorry when the late 47 the the UN General Assembly recommended the partition of [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2234.08s)]
*  historic Palestine into a a Jewish state and a Palestinian Arab state [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2245.2000000000003s)]
*  uh that triggered sort of the the I would say the first steps of of war [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2251.6s)]
*  between then the the sort of the Zionist armed forces and and Palestinians and and and that [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2259.36s)]
*  that blew up in full war when in May 48 Israel was declared the UN responded to that war by [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2266.56s)]
*  uh establishing uh Bush of a mediator for Palestine count Bernadotte of Sweden [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2277.04s)]
*  and he started to sort of you know work towards containing the situation [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2288.64s)]
*  initial steps towards ceasefire and also because he was a humanitarian a lifelong humanitarian he [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2296.48s)]
*  was the vice president of the Swedish Red Cross he had sort of in the in the second world war [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2304.24s)]
*  operated and and even been involved in in rescuing Jews so he witnessed sort of ethnic cleansing [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2310.64s)]
*  happening he knew what the legal ramifications of that were so he made a recommendation three [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2318.8799999999997s)]
*  months into his mandate or four months into his mandate for the refugees to be allowed to return [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2325.6s)]
*  one day after he made that recommendation he was assassinated by Jewish by by by [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2331.6s)]
*  Jewish extremists the Stern gang and and so in the aftermath of his assassination [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2340.96s)]
*  the in the following months between September and December 48 the General Assembly considered [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2350.08s)]
*  you know how to go about this this mandate and his role and his recommendation and that resulted [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2358.3199999999997s)]
*  after extensive negotiations I mean uh I think 194 is one of the most deliberated [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2365.52s)]
*  UN resolutions in the in the organization's history uh uh his one person the resolution that [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2373.4399999999996s)]
*  mandates the right of return for Palestinian refugees yeah and uh establishes the Consolidation [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2382.0s)]
*  Commission for Palestine so the General Assembly decided to replace a one person mandate [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2387.76s)]
*  by a commission uh of comprised of three states not individuals the US as the chair Turkey and [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2394.0s)]
*  France as the other two members to uh to essentially pursue the mandate of the mediator there was an [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2403.0400000000004s)]
*  interim mediator after Penel's death who Ralph Bunche Bunche who negotiated ceasefires but the [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2414.32s)]
*  Consolidation Commission started to look for a more longer term solution uh and and that included [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2421.28s)]
*  return of the refugees uh as well as other aspects recommended by the uh the General Assembly in the [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2427.92s)]
*  in the resolution uh creating the UNCCP and uh so it was the Americans who in the in the first half [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2435.36s)]
*  of 2019 took the lead in trying to convince Bangorion to take refugees back [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2444.2400000000002s)]
*  and Bangorion the first president of Israel essentially said you know this is not going to [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2450.32s)]
*  happen we're still in the process of consolidating our new state and and return is is not in order [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2456.0800000000004s)]
*  so then the Americans in the summer of 49 started looking for alternatives you know if if if return [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2463.6000000000004s)]
*  is not going to happen what do we do and then it was actually the American ambassador in [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2470.64s)]
*  Cairo who saw that would be a good idea to bring Gordon Klopp the president of the Tennessee Valley [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2475.3599999999997s)]
*  Authority on a feasibility study to see whether the TVA miracle could be replicated in the in the [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2482.0s)]
*  Near East and and that happened in September October uh 49 and then in that resulted then in [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2490.16s)]
*  uh a recommendation to create an agency to to sort of take on that role at the same time the [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2499.52s)]
*  humanitarian agencies that have provided initial relief to the refugees the ICRC [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2507.2799999999997s)]
*  uh the League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the Quakers the American Friends [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2514.72s)]
*  Service Committee in Gaza they announced in the autumn of 49 that they were not able to continue [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2520.64s)]
*  their relief operation beyond the spring of 1950 and so the UNCCP also had to provide for an [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2528.4s)]
*  alternative relief mechanism and that that is how UNRWA was then sort of shaped the United Nations [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2535.68s)]
*  Relief and Works Agency Works the large-scale public works works agency for Palestinian refugees [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2543.28s)]
*  in the Near East or for Palestinian refugees in the Near East and uh and initially I mean there [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2550.32s)]
*  was quite a bit of cynicism uh amongst uh host countries and and also refugee representatives [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2557.6000000000004s)]
*  about this mandate of UNRWA they had meant they had met with Gordon Klopp and politely offered him tea [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2565.84s)]
*  and listened to him and he had interpreted that as a as a sort of uh that his uh his overtures were [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2572.72s)]
*  welcome but in reality they were much more cynical and then especially when the initial [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2581.52s)]
*  draft resolution was floated by the Americans the initial draft resolution to establish UNRWA was [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2587.12s)]
*  floated by the Americans there was no reference to 194 to refugees to anything about sort of [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2593.3599999999997s)]
*  temporary arrangements so pending return so the the host countries or the Arab states were very [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2601.92s)]
*  sort of critical and then the Americans sort of amended the language and said you know the new [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2610.4s)]
*  resolution is without jeopardy to the right of return but in actual fact I mean it the by adopting [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2617.36s)]
*  the resolution establishing UNRWA the General Assembly in 12 months time had shifted from an [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2628.24s)]
*  approach to solutions based on return of voluntary repatriation to an approach to solutions based on [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2634.72s)]
*  local integration in the host countries so indeed the the refugees had reason to be to be skeptical [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2642.72s)]
*  and I when I when I teach UNRWA I sometimes talk about you know UNRWA's born in original sin [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2649.52s)]
*  you know as a undermining undermining the the the right of return which remains [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2657.36s)]
*  a legal imperative contrary to local integration and third country resettlement which is subject [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2667.2s)]
*  to sovereign decisions of third states return is a requirement under international law in view of [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2676.24s)]
*  the illegality of the ethnic cleansing of Palestine that and and again this is what [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2686.16s)]
*  Count Benadot knew and this is why he you know he he said refugees should be allowed to return [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2692.3199999999997s)]
*  because he had seen in the second world war and it had just been the Nuremberg trials that that [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2698.0s)]
*  forced displacement and forced transfer in wartime was a war crime and therefore triggering both [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2705.12s)]
*  individual criminal responsibility and and and state responsibility and and by means of reparations [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2711.92s)]
*  and reparations for situations of forced displacement is is sort of return restitution [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2719.6s)]
*  compensation where the properties were damaged and so forth yeah finally uh lex takenberg [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2726.88s)]
*  as someone who worked uh in UNRWA the UN agency for Palestine refugees for decades [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2735.3599999999997s)]
*  and now seeing what your uh colleagues who are still at the agency are dealing with [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2743.8399999999997s)]
*  what are you most concerned about right now when we look at the situation uh on the ground in Gaza [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2751.44s)]
*  through this just uh horrific genocide um while you know the the US and other western countries [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2758.48s)]
*  uh supported by Jordan are you know doing these very theatrical aid drops that are [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2766.4s)]
*  uh not addressing the the the needs of the 2 million 2.3 million people in Gaza who are [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2772.48s)]
*  facing catastrophic starvation which is a policy that Israel has engineered um [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2781.6s)]
*  what are you most concerned about right now as you as you watch all of this happen [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2788.08s)]
*  well i'm i'm obviously very concerned for the uh safety and security and well-being of both my [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2793.44s)]
*  former colleagues in Gaza many of whom are known for having worked there for having worked [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2804.0s)]
*  with the agency for decades including a decade in Gaza [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2810.96s)]

*  the since the 7th of October so i'm really really worried about their well-being their [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2824.7200000000003s)]
*  safety their ability to also you know about two or three thousand of them have on a daily basis [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME4yVxbYsH4&t=2832.0s)]
