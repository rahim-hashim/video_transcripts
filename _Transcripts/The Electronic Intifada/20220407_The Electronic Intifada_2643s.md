Video Description: On episode 54, we are joined by representatives of major Palestinian civil society organizations Sahar Francis and Ahmed Abofoul to talk about current progress in bringing an investigation into Israel‚Äôs crimes to the International Criminal Court, even as Israel ‚Äì and the US and Canada ‚Äì have tried to stifle progress.
Francis is the director of Addameer, the Prisoner‚Äôs support and Human Rights Association, and Abofoul is a legal researcher and advocacy officer at Al-Haq, a group that documents Israel‚Äôs human rights violations.
Addameer and Al-Haq are among six Palestinian civil society groups that Israel‚Äôs defense minister Benny Gantz designated last fall as ‚Äúterrorist‚Äù organizations ‚Äì an attempt to disrupt and destroy the work of these groups and especially their gathering of evidence for the ICC investigation.
Despite Gantz‚Äôs designations, these Palestinian civil society organizations have not stopped providing evidence of Israel‚Äôs war crimes to the International Criminal Court, Abofoul explains.
‚ÄúAs a matter of fact, Palestinian organizations are in a way the only access the court has to do the requisite documentation of the human rights violations and the alleged crimes committed in Palestine, since Israel does not allow any investigative body to access the occupied territory ‚Äì not only the ICC, [but] even the special rapporteurs of the UN and the commissions of inquiry,‚Äù Abofoul says.
Last year, Al-Haq and Addameer and other human rights organizations helped move the United Nations to establish a commission of inquiry in order to look at the root causes of Israel‚Äôs systematic discrimination on both sides of the 1967 boundary.
Francis says that she hopes this commission‚Äôs investigations will find that the situation for Palestinians is ‚Äúbeyond occupation.‚Äù
‚ÄúFor us, it‚Äôs not about the specific cases of the prisoners and the detainees. It‚Äôs about the phenomena of inventing a military control system, designed with the military orders and the military courts in order to obtain the control and persecution and oppression over the whole Palestinian community all these decades,‚Äù she says.
What are the responsibilities of third countries and how are we ‚Äúgoing to force Israel to end the whole system of control and not just occupation?‚Äù she asks.
Al-Haq and Addameer have also recently issued a joint submission to the United Nations‚Äô Human Rights Council during Israel‚Äôs fifth review of compliance with its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).
The Palestinian groups stated that Israel‚Äôs apartheid system is in direct violation of the ICCPR, and that ‚Äúthe indisputable reality on the ground is that Israel has been imposing a regime of racial discrimination against the Palestinians, who are rendered fragmented, vulnerable and unable to effectively challenge this regime.‚Äù
We also play clips from a February panel, organized by the Carter Center, called ‚ÄúPalestinian Civil Society Under Threat.‚Äù The event featured Francis and Al-Haq‚Äôs director Shawan Jabarin.

*  I'm Nora Barrows-Freedman. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=42.56s)]
*  Asa Wyn Stanley is off this week. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=44.08s)]
*  We're delighted today to be joined by Sahar Francis, Director of Ad-Dameer, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=46.56s)]
*  the Prisoners Support and Human Rights Association, and Ahmed Abu Foul, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=51.040000000000006s)]
*  Legal Researcher and Advocacy Officer at Al-Haq. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=55.76s)]
*  Both Sahar and Ahmed's organizations are two of the six Palestinian civil society groups [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=59.36s)]
*  that Israel's Defense Minister Benny Gantz designated last fall as, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=64.96s)]
*  quote, terrorist organizations. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=69.2s)]
*  A clear attempt to disrupt and destroy the work of these groups, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=71.6s)]
*  and especially their ongoing gathering of evidence to take Israel to the international [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=75.44s)]
*  court to the International Criminal Court for its violations of Palestinian human rights. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=81.12s)]
*  In one moment, we'll go to our guests and talk about updates in the ICC investigations. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  But first, here are some excerpts of a February panel organized by the Carter Center [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=91.04s)]
*  called Palestinian Civil Society Under Threat, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=96.64s)]
*  featuring Sahar Francis and Shawan Jabarin of Al-Haq, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=99.92s)]
*  along with many other representatives of Palestinian organizations. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=103.28s)]
*  Let's go to that. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=107.12s)]
*  We were facing attacks much, much before this designation. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=108.24s)]
*  There's other forms of harassment and intimidation and tools that they were trying to use in order [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=114.16s)]
*  to silence us, like several colleagues were arrested, whether under administrative detention [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=124.63999999999999s)]
*  or charged and convicted and raiding the office of Al-Dhamiyar several times in 2002, in 2012, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=130.88s)]
*  in 2019, stealing computers, cameras, and missing the files and stealing material from the offices, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=142.16s)]
*  and putting restrictions of movement against the staff members, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=150.88s)]
*  board members, and general assembly members, and all this mere campaign that were led by the NGO [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=157.84s)]
*  monitor and other Israeli right-wing organizations over the last couple of years, and trying really [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=164.8s)]
*  to distribute false information against us in order to affect mainly our donors and our supporters [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=173.68s)]
*  in the international level. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=182.96s)]
*  So we were kind of aware how much our work is bothering them, that they are worried, and [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=184.48s)]
*  they know that we are succeeding at some point in the legal work and the accountability in the [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=194.16s)]
*  international level, especially with the UN and the ICC. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=202.32s)]
*  And we are expecting that we will pay a price for such a work that we are doing. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=206.95999999999998s)]
*  If they want to close the door before the peaceful and legal way to defend rights, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=214.23999999999998s)]
*  which way they want to leave for people to defend their rights? This is an issue. Another thing is, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=221.51999999999998s)]
*  is this an action of democratic society or democratic government or democratic action? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=229.6s)]
*  This is also another one. The third one is we are speaking about the most credible organizations. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=238.56s)]
*  Also, the organizations received awards for their work. One of their award is Carter award for Al-Haq, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=246.0s)]
*  for instance, in 89. This is an issue. Another thing is also even just a few weeks ago, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=254.56s)]
*  two weeks ago, organizations nominated to Nobel Prize for their work. And I think this is an issue [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=263.44s)]
*  and this is the reasons. If you want to uproot and to close the door before this kind of work, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=272.88s)]
*  which work you want to stay to fight against oppression, to fight against injustice, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=279.52s)]
*  to fight against apartheid regime, to fight against all of these horrible crimes taking place on [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=288.24s)]
*  the daily basis in Palestine? That's the main thing. Another thing is also what's about, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=297.2s)]
*  what's about just secret file and there is no evidence? And you can ask the American officials, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=305.44s)]
*  do they have evidence? Did they receive really a credible evidence from the Israeli side? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=314.23999999999995s)]
*  This is the case. If they want something, they can send also a mission from the Congress, for [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=320.88s)]
*  instance, to Palestine to investigate the situation here. And we accept that. Please do. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=327.76s)]
*  Sahar Francis and Ahmed Abou-Foul, thank you so much for being with us today on the Electronic [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=333.84s)]
*  and Tafara podcast. Thank you. Thank you for having us. Of course. Ahmed, let's start with [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=338.23999999999995s)]
*  you. Can you talk about any updates in the process of bringing an investigation into Israel's crimes [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=346.32s)]
*  to the ICC? Even as Israel and of course the US and Canada have tried to stifle any progress, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=352.32s)]
*  are you still compiling evidence for investigators? Yes, sure. Well, maybe the short [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=360.0s)]
*  answer would be to indicate that on the 3rd of March 2021, the ICC, a former prosecutor, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=368.32s)]
*  Fatou bin Sudda, officially announced the initiation of its investigation in the situation in Palestine. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=376.32s)]
*  The investigation currently focused on possible war crimes related to three [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=381.2s)]
*  areas. First is related to the 2014 military offensive in Gaza, second to the 2018-2019 [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=387.76s)]
*  Gaza protests known as the Great March Return, and third on the Israeli illegal settlements [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=397.59999999999997s)]
*  in the West Bank. Now, supposedly the next step should be moving from situation stage to [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=403.28s)]
*  a case building stage. So in other words, building specific cases, identifying perpetrators, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=410.64s)]
*  and subsequently request summons to appear or arrest warrants. This is in short where we're at [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=416.24s)]
*  right now, but perhaps it's useful to give a brief procedure history of how we got here. As a matter [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=424.16s)]
*  of fact, Palestine's journey in the pursuit for justice at the ICC started long before that date [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=434.56s)]
*  before last year 2021. Perhaps to start with the situation, Palestine was initially brought to the [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=441.6s)]
*  ICC in 2009 after the offensive in Gaza when Palestine lodged a declaration under Article 12, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=450.48s)]
*  paragraph 3, recognizing the court jurisdiction, which is on a voluntary basis a state that is not [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=458.48s)]
*  party to the court can accept the court jurisdiction. In April 2012, the then prosecutor [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=467.12s)]
*  concluded that the status of Palestine at the UN as an observer entity was determinative [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=475.44s)]
*  since the accession to the Rome Statute usually takes place by lodging the accession to the UN [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=482.0s)]
*  Secretary General as the acting depository. And therefore Palestine could not, this was the [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=490.16s)]
*  conclusion of the prosecutor, could not accede to the Rome Statute and could not lodge the declaration [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=496.8s)]
*  in accordance with Article 12, paragraph 3. After that in November 2012, Palestine's status at the [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=503.20000000000005s)]
*  UN was elevated to a non-member observer status and therefore subsequently in January 2015, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=511.12s)]
*  Palestine could accede to the Rome Statute. Two weeks later the Office of the Prosecutor started [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=520.32s)]
*  a permanent examination in the case. Notably here since you asked me about states that tried to [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=526.48s)]
*  to obstruct the investigation, Canada was the only state party, the only ICC state party at that time [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=533.52s)]
*  to lodge an objection to the UN's Secretary General claiming that Palestine does not meet the [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=541.52s)]
*  criteria of a state under international law and that Palestine is not recognized by Canada as a [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=547.52s)]
*  state and therefore it's not able to accede the Rome Statute. Of course this did not have effect, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=553.8399999999999s)]
*  although arguably if this would have effect it could only be on the treaty relations between [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=560.56s)]
*  the two states, not on Palestine's ability to join the Rome Statute. In May 2018, apparently [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=567.28s)]
*  because the permanent examination was taking very long, Palestine submitted to the prosecutor a [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=575.36s)]
*  referral pursuant to Article 13, paragraph A and Article 14, which is known as a self-referrer, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=580.72s)]
*  in this case when a state party refers the situation in its territory to the court. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=587.12s)]
*  And this was an oval situation to the ICC, as a matter of fact it was the first [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=594.08s)]
*  refer and a sense of complaint since it was against nationals of a third state, in this case [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=599.44s)]
*  of an occupying power. In December 2019 the prosecutor announced that the permanent [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=607.2800000000001s)]
*  examination was completed and that all the statutory criteria for opening investigation [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=614.64s)]
*  had been met. On the same day the prosecutor requested from the pre-trial chamber a jurisdictional [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=621.84s)]
*  ruling on the scope of its territorial jurisdiction and some have argued that this [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=627.6800000000001s)]
*  was not necessary, indeed it was not necessary, the prosecutor did not need an authorization from [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=634.64s)]
*  the court, but at that time the prosecutor deemed that this was important for her to proceed [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=641.44s)]
*  in the investigation. In its request the Fatouk Monsouda, the then prosecutor noted that there is [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=650.64s)]
*  reasonable belief, and this is important to note, since 2019 before even starting investigation she [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=657.3599999999999s)]
*  noted that there is reasonable basis to believe that war crimes have been or are being committed [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=663.12s)]
*  in the occupied Palestinian territory and therefore it has already identified potential cases, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=668.4799999999999s)]
*  and I'm quoting what she said, identified potential cases arising from the situation [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=674.96s)]
*  which would be admissible. So it's clear that the then prosecutor had already identified cases and [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=680.8000000000001s)]
*  could start with building the case and identifying perpetrators. Now in January 2020 the ICC started [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=691.0400000000001s)]
*  the procedure and invited experts known as Amicus Correa Prives, friends of the courts, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=703.36s)]
*  to submit their opinion on the case and it granted 34 Amicus Correa requests to submit [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=709.92s)]
*  observations to the court and nine requests from international organizations and states. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=718.24s)]
*  The League of Arab States and the Organization of Islamic Cooperations were the two organizations [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=723.2s)]
*  in favor of the court's jurisdiction over the occupied Palestinian territory and seven states [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=728.32s)]
*  submitted against the ICC jurisdiction and these were the Czech Republic, Germany, Austria, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=733.6800000000001s)]
*  Hungary, Australia, Brazil and Uganda and as you can see many of them now are very enthusiastic [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=743.36s)]
*  about the investigation in Ukraine. On 5 February 2021 the pre-Tribal chamber issued this decision [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=750.96s)]
*  that the ICC territorial jurisdiction extend to the occupied Palestinian territory in its entirety, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=759.6800000000001s)]
*  in other words the West Bank including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip and in March 2021 [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=767.6800000000001s)]
*  the the prosecutor Fatima Suda and the former prosecutor announced that she initiated her [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=774.32s)]
*  investigation in the situation in Palestine. That's where we're at right now as to [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=782.24s)]
*  providing evidence to the court. Palestinian organizations have not stopped providing evidence [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=790.5600000000001s)]
*  to the court and continue to do so. As a matter of fact Palestinian organizations are in a way [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=799.04s)]
*  the only access the court has to their quesadilla documentation of the human rights violations and [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=804.9599999999999s)]
*  the alleged crimes committed in Palestine since Israel does not allow any investigative body to [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=810.4s)]
*  access the occupied territory not only the ICC even the special rapporteurs of the UN and the [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=818.7199999999999s)]
*  commission of inquiries. So where does that leave the investigation now like what is the you know [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=823.68s)]
*  you're still compiling evidence but where is it going and what is the next step especially as the [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=831.68s)]
*  as there is a new you know director of the ICC lead lead investigator I mean? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=838.3199999999999s)]
*  As I mentioned now the situation should move from a situation under investigation to the stage of [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=844.7199999999999s)]
*  building cases identifying specific cases and identifying perpetrators and therefore after that [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=853.76s)]
*  we hope to see requests for arrest warrants and summons to appears but this has not yet happened [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=862.16s)]
*  so we're at that stage. Thanks Ahmed. Sahar and Ahmed can you talk about the double standard [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=871.2800000000001s)]
*  you alluded to it a little bit Ahmed being applied to Russia at the moment when western countries [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=882.1600000000001s)]
*  many of those who have you know stood in the way of the ICC you know launching these investigations [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=887.0400000000001s)]
*  into Israeli war crimes saying that they you know it was fast tracked the US was saying that [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=894.8000000000001s)]
*  that they had you know started a process to push the ICC to investigate Russia over its invasion [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=901.76s)]
*  of Ukraine while at the same time these countries are as you as you mentioned trying to shield Israel [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=907.76s)]
*  from accountability. Sahar what are your thoughts on on how you see these you know western countries [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=913.9200000000001s)]
*  rushing to the ICC right now while you know trying to trying to discredit Palestine's [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=921.52s)]
*  investigations? Honestly I wasn't surprised by this double standard [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=929.68s)]
*  Hippocratic position because we are so familiar with this double standard behave especially from [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=936.24s)]
*  the United States, Canada, European countries that they are for decades now putting all their [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=944.08s)]
*  efforts in order to ban us from reaching accountability via other platforms whether internally [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=955.2800000000001s)]
*  in the UN human rights mechanisms by objecting and putting obstacles and abstaining from the [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=963.6s)]
*  chapter seven discussion in item seven sorry discussion in the human rights council session [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=972.4799999999999s)]
*  or blocking any efforts in local domestic justice systems in Europe and in other places so actually [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=980.0799999999999s)]
*  it was expected that in the ICC level they would put all the efforts they have in order [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=989.92s)]
*  to block the Palestinians from reaching this opportunity and especially now with the position [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=997.92s)]
*  of the United States that they were punishing the ICC and the office the prosecutor office over [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1006.0s)]
*  the decision on the Palestinian case now that they are supporting that the same body will [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1015.04s)]
*  investigate Russia on the Ukraine war this is just disclose how serious the politicization for the [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1022.08s)]
*  international human rights standards and the international law and I think all human rights [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1035.76s)]
*  defenders and human rights organizations have responsibilities to be much vocal over this [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1043.1999999999998s)]
*  Hippocratic behave and political interfere in the work of the ICC and such double standards should [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1053.04s)]
*  end because with such behave there's no justice going to come for any victim or no real accountability [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1062.6399999999999s)]
*  for any perpetrator in our world. Ahmed did you want to add to that? Well yes I think one needs to [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1072.16s)]
*  differentiate them like if we're talking about double standards of states it's not really [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1082.5600000000002s)]
*  surprising because this has always been the case when it comes to to Israel there's always this [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1087.2s)]
*  special treatment it's not being held to the same standards of any other states but when it comes [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1095.84s)]
*  to the court I would professionally and personally speaking I would be reluctant to say that there is [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1103.12s)]
*  double standards I think so far the the prosecutor is navigating his way through a very [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1109.92s)]
*  in my view very difficult dynamic and it could be that he's using the opportunity for example [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1116.0s)]
*  we heard the prosecutor announcing a request for voluntary contribution the ICC has had this [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1125.2s)]
*  financial budgetary problem for for years and you can see the difference between the [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1133.04s)]
*  the what the prosecutor is asking for and what the states are responding to so for example he [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1140.24s)]
*  says volunteer to contribution for the support of his office across situations meaning that [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1145.6s)]
*  no state can actually contribute financially for a specific investigation that's not how [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1152.3200000000002s)]
*  international justice work while at the same time the way states are responding they're [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1156.5600000000002s)]
*  declaring that they're contributing to the to support the investigation in Ukraine sometimes [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1161.92s)]
*  they don't even say it but the whole statement is crafted to say this and in some cases I would even [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1167.28s)]
*  name one the French ambassador to the Hague retweeted something and then the prosecutor [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1174.32s)]
*  retweeted it and reaffirmed across situations but states don't apparently understand that so I think [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1182.56s)]
*  I understand that the prosecutor has to to find innovative way to get support for the court but [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1191.84s)]
*  um it's also a sensitive area one has to be uh to be careful of how international justice [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1198.5600000000002s)]
*  uh more I would be very reluctant to say so far that there is uh any double standards from the [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1205.52s)]
*  court but to be honest I I can conveniently claim that there is double standards if for example [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1211.6000000000001s)]
*  we would say we would see a case being presented in the situation in Ukraine before the situation [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1218.8000000000002s)]
*  Palestine simply because the timeline of of both situations is almost similar um of course I'm not [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1226.0s)]
*  comparing two situations one cannot compare uh two situations before the international criminal [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1233.76s)]
*  court every situation has its own uh considerations but it would be very strange if we see at least [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1239.52s)]
*  in my view if we see a case being presented to the court in the situation in Ukraine [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1246.96s)]
*  before a case presented in the situation in Palestine especially as we just mentioned that [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1251.5200000000002s)]
*  since the the former prosecutor submitted her request to the pretrial chamber it declared that [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1256.8000000000002s)]
*  it had already identified cases and they should be presented soon. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1264.48s)]
*  Thanks for that. Let's talk about the kind of work that both of your organizations are involved in [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1271.3600000000001s)]
*  including the establishment last year of an ongoing commission of inquiry to look at the root [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1277.76s)]
*  causes of Israel of Israel's systematic discrimination on both sides of the green line. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1282.8799999999999s)]
*  Sahar can you take us through what this commission of inquiry is um and and how Ademir fits into that? [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1289.68s)]
*  Yes actually this is the first time that the UN appointing such an investigative group to [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1297.2800000000002s)]
*  dig into the root causes and not to investigate in a specific action of war crime or crimes against [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1307.8400000000001s)]
*  humanity like for example the Goldstone investigating committee after the war on Gaza and [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1316.48s)]
*  other investigating inquiries or let's say the kind of work that special reporters are able to do. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1325.6s)]
*  So this is very important and very powerful body that we as Palestinians for the first time [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1335.12s)]
*  would be able to discuss really the root causes of the Palestinian situation going even before 1948 [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1345.44s)]
*  when the Zionist movement started their ideology and project planned for Palestine and [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1360.0s)]
*  colonization over Palestine for decades. So for example in our work as Ademir, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1368.0800000000002s)]
*  how it's connected as an organization that specified on the work with Palestinian prisoners [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1375.2s)]
*  in front of the Israeli occupation whether military courts or civil courts and so on. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1382.96s)]
*  So for us it's not about the specific cases of the prisoners and the detainees it's about the [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1389.68s)]
*  phenomena of inventing a military control system designed with the military orders and the military [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1396.16s)]
*  courts in order to obtain the control and the persecution and the oppression over the whole [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1404.48s)]
*  Palestinian community all these decades. So it's very important that in our meeting with the [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1415.68s)]
*  committee a couple of days ago we highlighted the practices [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1423.76s)]
*  and the policies of torture of arbitrary detention over decades in a widespread manner [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1431.04s)]
*  and how actually the law was manipulated in the military courts and the legal procedures, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1440.8s)]
*  criminal procedures pretend to present this system as an objective system that offers fair [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1450.8s)]
*  trial standards while in the reality it's designed in a way that no matter how much you [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1459.4399999999998s)]
*  put efforts, legal efforts, you cannot succeed, you cannot reach any success in this system because [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1469.12s)]
*  it's designed in order to maintain the control over the Palestinian society. So I hope that this [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1478.64s)]
*  committee would conclude that it's beyond occupation, it's not just occupation, it's [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1485.1200000000001s)]
*  illegal occupation, it's colonial settler regime that cannot and the response the most important [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1494.5600000000002s)]
*  thing here is what would be the responsibilities of the third state parties and the international [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1502.96s)]
*  society not just the responsibility of the state of Israel but how we are going to force [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1509.68s)]
*  Israel to end the whole system of control and not just the occupation. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1518.4s)]
*  Ahmed what can you say about the work that Al Haq is doing with this inquiry? [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1527.44s)]
*  First like about the commission of inquiry itself it's unique in every sense of the word and very [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1533.6000000000001s)]
*  important. First this is the first commission of inquiry that does not have a limited [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1540.72s)]
*  time frame or scope, it's an ongoing commission of inquiry and it's mandated to investigate the [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1548.5600000000002s)]
*  root causes of the conflict or of the human rights violations that take place against Palestinian [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1557.12s)]
*  people and most importantly it has the features of an investigative body so in addition to [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1565.04s)]
*  underlying the root causes of the conflict it has the mandate to collect, consolidate and analyse [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1575.12s)]
*  evidence of such violations so in that sense I think it's a very important commission of inquiry [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1581.28s)]
*  and this is the first time that perhaps an official body would look at the situation as a whole in both [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1588.4s)]
*  sides of the green line. Lately we see for example the fragmentation of the Palestinian people is not [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1596.0s)]
*  only geographically it's even in the way this question is being perceived so for example [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1604.0s)]
*  we have special opportunity situation in the Yikboah capacity in church who a few days ago [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1610.88s)]
*  concluded that Israel is committing the crime of apartheid but because of his mandate that is only [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1615.84s)]
*  limited to the Yikboah capacity in church he cannot address apartheid laws practices and policies that [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1622.16s)]
*  take place inside the green line he cannot address the denial of right to return to Palestinian [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1628.56s)]
*  refugees outside the territory so in that sense I think it has a very important [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1634.96s)]
*  rule and addressing the root causes as Sahar mentioned would necessitate that this commission [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1644.0s)]
*  of inquiry touch upon the settler colonial nature of this occupation Israel does not have [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1650.3999999999999s)]
*  an ordinary occupation there is no occupation in modern history that lasted for 55 years [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1658.8000000000002s)]
*  this is not a temporary occupation and this is an intent to maintain this regime as a matter of [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1664.8000000000002s)]
*  fact in my personal view I think Israel needed this occupation it's not like a situation that [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1671.0400000000002s)]
*  Israel had to deal with and working to end the occupation but it needed the occupation to [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1679.76s)]
*  prolonged or to even establish an apartheid regime that can last forever it has [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1686.24s)]
*  instrumentalized the international humanitarian law and the laws of armed conflict framework [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1694.72s)]
*  to pursue its colonial objectives and this is clear from Israel's settlements policy [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1701.76s)]
*  you have a state that claims to to one piece but at the same time keeps stealing basically [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1709.28s)]
*  stealing land and the settler colonial objective of having acquiring more land by force with less [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1717.76s)]
*  Palestinian people I think is clear as for Al-Haqq work our mandate is very clear we [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1724.16s)]
*  we document human rights violations that take place in the Yikboah Palestinian territory and against [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1731.84s)]
*  the individual and collective rights of the Palestinian people regardless of the perpetrator [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1738.0800000000002s)]
*  so we document everything so whatever the the commission of inquiry asks for we we we provide [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1743.68s)]
*  and I have to say perhaps this is one of the reasons that our organization as the Al-Haqq [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1750.32s)]
*  and Damir and others have been designated as terrorist organizations it's because our work [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1755.68s)]
*  hurts our works basically expose this apartheid regime that attempts to portray itself to the [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1762.16s)]
*  world as the only democracy in the Middle East which in my view this is the only regime in the [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1771.6s)]
*  world that is self-proclaimed and with promoted as as only democracy while in fact it's an apartheid [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1777.84s)]
*  racist regime so I think in short I cannot give details but in short I can assure you that in [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1785.2s)]
*  accordance with our mandate we do everything in our power to provide the commission of inquiry or [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1795.8400000000001s)]
*  any investigative body that is seeking to investigate international crimes or human rights [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1801.28s)]
*  violations and will be useful in providing justice for the victims affected by those [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1807.76s)]
*  violations we would provide them with anything they need to do everything in our power. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1814.8s)]
*  You mentioned the the mounting declarations by UN envoys by human rights organizations [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1821.76s)]
*  you know in addition to the decades of analysis by Palestinian organizations that Israel is [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1830.72s)]
*  practicing apartheid. What do you think about whether the ICC bringing it back to the to the [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1838.48s)]
*  international court for a minute whether the ICC could investigate Israel's apartheid system as a [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1847.76s)]
*  whole even though its territorial jurisdiction is limited to the West Bank and Gaza just as you [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1853.6s)]
*  pointed out with the UN rapporteurs does it you know jurisdiction. Could the commission of inquiry [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1858.88s)]
*  tapped by the UN human rights council to investigate Israel's system of oppression as a whole [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1866.48s)]
*  you know contribute to that I mean is there is there a chance that this jurisdiction can [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1873.0400000000002s)]
*  be applied to the entire you know breadth of historic Palestine geographically? [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1879.7600000000002s)]
*  As for the ICC I think the the the jurisdictional limitations are are clear [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1885.1200000000001s)]
*  it's the occupied Palestinian territory namely the West Bank including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1891.52s)]
*  Now the commission of inquiry can address the situation as a whole on both sides in the green [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1897.44s)]
*  line the ICC cannot but the commission of inquiry can actually provide its conclusions the evidence [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1901.92s)]
*  it collected or consolidated the the reports that has conducted or investigations that has [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1911.12s)]
*  conducted it can transmit this to to the office of the prosecutor there's an open I would assume [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1917.6799999999998s)]
*  normally speaking there is an open channel of communication but this information can for the [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1924.2399999999998s)]
*  ICC can only be used when it comes to the occupied Palestinian territory and when it comes to the [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1929.9199999999998s)]
*  crimes against humanity of apartheid in my view when it comes to the ICC it doesn't really [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1934.32s)]
*  make a difference whether the ICC addresses the situation as a whole or in the occupied Palestinian [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1943.9199999999998s)]
*  territory because crimes against humanity of apartheid is a crime that requires [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1949.2s)]
*  high-level individuals to be taking these decisions of institutionalizing this regime of racial [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1954.6399999999999s)]
*  discrimination with the intent to maintain this regime so either way it could the ICC could [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1960.64s)]
*  identify the same perpetrators for the scope of the occupied Palestinian territory but the actions [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1967.1200000000001s)]
*  will have been committed for against the Palestinian people as a whole so for for for the [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1972.16s)]
*  considerations of international injustice the ICC doesn't actually need to address the whole [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1980.3200000000002s)]
*  situation when it comes to the crime of apartheid it can only look at the bypassing the territory [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1985.6s)]
*  and prosecute individual perpetrators [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1992.1599999999999s)]
*  Sahar if you could touch upon Palestine being a litmus test of the legitimacy of the ICC and why [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=1997.52s)]
*  it has global implications for the international legal system and human rights framework [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2007.28s)]
*  what is the significance of Palestine at the ICC? [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2012.3999999999999s)]
*  I think it's a very important case because we are the only [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2020.1599999999999s)]
*  state under occupation if you want lasting as Ahmed said for decades this is a unique [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2028.8s)]
*  occupation case and this is why we claim it's beyond occupation it's more than the occupation [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2037.92s)]
*  according to the international humanitarian law standards but I also wanted to highlight that I [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2046.3200000000002s)]
*  think this commission of inquiry that was founded last year for me personally was a very important [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2056.48s)]
*  year for me personally as a lawyer working in the field for the last 25 years with all the efforts [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2065.84s)]
*  to reach accountability via the UN mechanisms is much more important than the ICC because I think [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2076.08s)]
*  there is a potential in this committee because as Ahmed described it's not limited on the [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2086.88s)]
*  time frame and its scope is to go and investigate for the root causes it's very important that they [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2093.7599999999998s)]
*  can include in their recommendations and conclusions specific actions that it's the responsibility of [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2102.7999999999997s)]
*  the general assembly and state parties which means they should ask for sanctions on Israel [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2110.48s)]
*  in order to dismantle this colonial regime where in the ICC the maximum that we can seek [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2119.68s)]
*  is individual criminalization and accountability for individual Israeli perpetrators [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2128.72s)]
*  and not for the state and the whole system the ICC is not going to prosecute Israel as a state [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2138.0s)]
*  and the system of this state so this is a very important difference and this is it's not [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2145.68s)]
*  contradicting it's not undermining each other's work it's complementary as Ahmed said the report [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2155.68s)]
*  of this commission could be used by the ICC and this is why the this is also why the Palestinian [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2163.04s)]
*  case is very unique and very important because I don't think we can ignore this long decades of [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2172.32s)]
*  systematic violation for every almost every aspect of the international humanitarian law [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2185.76s)]
*  and all the way trying to avoid accountability Israel was the only state almost in the UN [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2194.48s)]
*  that kept violating systematically and committing war crimes and crimes against humanity [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2202.32s)]
*  all these more than 70 decades without at least once to be accountable for what they are doing [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2211.1200000000003s)]
*  and add on top they are always trying to undermine the international humanitarian standards by [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2220.1600000000003s)]
*  switching the definitions or the explanation or what it means to implement and unfortunately [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2228.08s)]
*  we're totally supported by political motivated decision-makers from the different countries [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2238.0s)]
*  especially the European countries and the United States at the end of the day it totally affected [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2246.7999999999997s)]
*  the international system I mean on the legal level and the criminal the international criminal [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2253.12s)]
*  system and what it means if we developed all these concepts of universal jurisdiction procedures [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2260.4s)]
*  in order to enable states to prosecute perpetrators on very serious crimes that [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2268.32s)]
*  affects the whole humanity like torture how come you when it comes for an Israeli perpetrator [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2277.2799999999997s)]
*  of a crime of torture you you block your internal system in front of the Palestinians [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2285.3599999999997s)]
*  in order to protect the Israelis so I think this is should end and international humanitarian law [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2293.7599999999998s)]
*  and international human rights law should be really implemented equally and in the same way [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2301.7599999999998s)]
*  all over in any conflict in any war in any for the protection of any victim in the world this is why [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2309.2s)]
*  the the the Palestinian case actually is the test case for this system if it could be really a just [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2318.64s)]
*  system and a system that respects all victims no matter what what's their ethnicity ethnicity or [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2326.64s)]
*  or color or belonging or whatever or not or it would be always blind by the political [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2336.0s)]
*  interests of this state or that state [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2344.16s)]
*  Absolutely. Ahmed, did you want to add anything? [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2347.6s)]
*  Palestine is the significance. I just I would echo what Sahar said Palestine is indeed [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2352.4s)]
*  a test for the whole war order the whole post second world war order the the the world has [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2360.56s)]
*  the the the world has has now a world order that is established on or based on international law [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2370.64s)]
*  and you have this country Israel that is in fact altering and jeopardizing this whole system by [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2378.48s)]
*  violating international law and refuse to abide by its rules. Israel is the only country in the world [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2388.08s)]
*  that is still committing colonization and apartheid at the same time as well like there's almost [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2394.24s)]
*  no violation that Israel has not committed the situation. Palestine is one of the most documented [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2401.6s)]
*  situations in the whole world one of the most protracted situations in the whole world and yet [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2408.4799999999996s)]
*  a climate of impunity prevail no justice is being provided so I think this is a test to the whole [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2414.72s)]
*  uh world order the whole international law system and to the ICC itself the ICC has been criticized [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2422.3199999999997s)]
*  for for a very long time that it only targets African states criticism that person I do not [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2430.3199999999997s)]
*  agree because somebody these states actually they asked the court to intervene but in other [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2436.08s)]
*  situations where we have Palestine a state party made a referral this supposed to be stronger than [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2441.92s)]
*  any case because you have a state party that is meeting its financial contribution [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2447.44s)]
*  meeting all of its obligations by the statute but then the situation is not being [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2454.56s)]
*  persecuted now it's over 13 years and no justice is being served so I think this is a test for [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2459.44s)]
*  for for the ICC itself and and I think would be a determinative factor for its future as an [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2465.92s)]
*  institution maybe I would like to also add something when we talk about the uh the situation [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2473.12s)]
*  Palestine and the Palestinian territory the West Bank including East Jerusalem and the Gaster [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2480.0s)]
*  this is only 22 percent for historic Palestine but the past this is the historic compromise that [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2485.6s)]
*  the Palestinians have made for peace and yet Israel finds the 22 very much so it wants to colonize [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2491.7599999999998s)]
*  and build settlements and acquire a territory by force from those 22 percent from my very little [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2499.28s)]
*  experience in this field that interacting with with Palestinians I think the Palestinians are [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2508.0800000000004s)]
*  only asking for for their rights nothing more and I can assure you that they would never [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2514.48s)]
*  settle for nothing less and they should not be asked to to compromise their human rights [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2521.52s)]
*  and I think again Palestinians are not asking for more than human rights as a matter of fact [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2528.24s)]
*  they're not even asking I think the word misunderstood the Palestinians they're demanding [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2533.68s)]
*  their human rights they're entitled to those rights no one would be doing them a favor when [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2537.92s)]
*  when they achieve their collective individual rights and I think one way or another [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2543.44s)]
*  uh this will be inevitable as any case of colonization has ended colonization apartheid [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2552.0s)]
*  should not have a place in this world whether committed by an European country or African [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2560.08s)]
*  country or wherever in the world even if committed by Israel which always have special treatment [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2UBWJQtoZQ&t=2567.68s)]
