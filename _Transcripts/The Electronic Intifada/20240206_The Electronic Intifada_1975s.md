# How are women giving birth in Gaza? with Laila Baker | EI Podcast
**The Electronic Intifada:** [February 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc)
*  Welcome back to the Electronic Intifada podcast. I'm Nora Barrows-Freedman. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=0.0s)]
*  In mid-January, UNICEF's communications specialist Tess Ingram said that nearly 20,000 babies have [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=4.64s)]
*  been born into the war on Gaza. Quote, that's a baby born into this horrendous war every 10 minutes. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=11.6s)]
*  A nurse, she said, had quote performed emergency caesarians on six dead women in the last eight [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=19.28s)]
*  weeks. The nurse told Ingram that there have been more miscarriages because of the unhealthy air [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=25.68s)]
*  and smoke due to Israel's incessant bombing. Quote, the situation of pregnant women and [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=31.2s)]
*  newborns in the Gaza Strip is beyond belief and it demands intensified and immediate actions, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=37.68s)]
*  Ingram said. The already precarious situation of infant and maternal mortality has worsened as the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=43.44s)]
*  healthcare system collapses. Becoming a mother should be a time for celebration, Ingram said. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=50.48s)]
*  In Gaza, it's another child delivered into hell. Meanwhile, menstruating girls and women have little [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=56.16s)]
*  access to hygiene products in Gaza and have forced many to improvise with scraps of fabric which can [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=63.04s)]
*  lead to infections. To talk more about the situation women, girls, and infants face in Gaza right now, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  I'm joined today by Layla Bakker. Layla is the regional director for Arab states at UNFPA, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=75.6s)]
*  the UN Agency for Sexual and Reproductive Health. She's worked at a number of UN agencies, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=82.39999999999999s)]
*  including UNRWA, and was previously the regional director for Arab states at the UN Development [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=88.16s)]
*  Coordination Office. Layla Bakker, it's an honor to have you with us and thank you for joining me [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=93.6s)]
*  today to talk about a very important but incredibly difficult subject. Thank you so much for having me [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=98.72s)]
*  on the program. Thank you. Let's jump in. What is the typical labor and delivery experience for women [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=104.72s)]
*  in Gaza right now compared to what it was like during the 17-year blockade before October 7th, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=115.68s)]
*  which was already pretty precarious to begin with? Well, I think you said it was pretty precarious [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=123.2s)]
*  to begin with, but UNFPA and all of our partners, both the UN agencies like UNICEF, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=130.0s)]
*  the World Health Organization, but also our national partners on the ground, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=136.8s)]
*  we are looking to build whatever capacity that we can and the infrastructure that's necessary [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=141.68s)]
*  to support women and girls wherever they may be, but particularly in crisis. So during the 17 years [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=148.48s)]
*  of blockade that we had experienced prior to the war, we spent quite a bit of time working with [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=155.68s)]
*  all of those partners that I just mentioned to see how could we substantiate primary health care, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=162.88s)]
*  ensure that women who were trying to get pregnant or who were pregnant got the care that they needed, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=170.0s)]
*  both the physical care but also the support network. It can be incredibly lonely, especially [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=176.08s)]
*  if you're a first-time mom, to have the network around you to quell that anxiety, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=181.68s)]
*  to make sure that there's somebody there to help you through it if you have any questions about [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  what it might be to be a mom. There are lots of peers and so forth, and we're very proud of the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=193.36s)]
*  work that we have done with our partners. Fast forward to October 7th and the destruction and [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=201.12s)]
*  near annihilation of the health system in a mere four months has left everyone very fragile, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=209.11999999999998s)]
*  pregnant, woman, man, child, it doesn't matter. When you've already annihilated over 1% of the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=217.12s)]
*  population, and we know that those constitute genocidal acts as validated by the International [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  Court of Justice, you can only imagine the plight of a woman who's trying to bring a baby into this [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=230.56s)]
*  world. You said it, that it should be a joyous moment, even if there is anxiety, but you would [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=237.52s)]
*  hope that she and her family would have access to at least a skilled person, not necessarily a [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=244.08s)]
*  physician. We have great midwives there, and we've always been able to cope. Even during the most [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=251.92000000000002s)]
*  vicious Israeli incursions, we've been able to ensure that we have a hotline, have trained [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=258.96000000000004s)]
*  midwives, physicians on the line if you needed help. We have safe birthing kits that were [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=266.16s)]
*  delivered to women through our primary healthcare networks. That's not even possible right now. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=271.68s)]
*  With communication cuts, we haven't even been able to do that. It's horrible. I can tell you [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=277.6s)]
*  terrible stories, but one that stayed, there were two that stayed with me, actually. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=284.96000000000004s)]
*  One is a woman who was heavily pregnant and fleeing from the bombing in the early days, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=289.52000000000004s)]
*  and she said every step was a race to death. I could feel it, and though I feared for my own [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=294.4s)]
*  life, I feared more for that of my baby. The second one is a rather unhappy ending, a woman [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=301.35999999999996s)]
*  who was wounded. She came into the hospital. They were trying to save her life before the babies. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=310.4s)]
*  Unfortunately, she died, and she was one of those women that we had to conduct a caesarean section [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=317.28s)]
*  on while she was dead. It's just unimaginable. I just can't even begin to understand how this is [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=325.28s)]
*  happening in 2024. It's terrifying. For anyone who's been around labor and delivery, or has been [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=339.92s)]
*  through it, or knows someone who has, there are so many things that can go wrong. It's such a delicate [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=349.04s)]
*  and careful process, and there are lots of medications and medical supplies that need to be on hand. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=357.84s)]
*  What about medications such as pitocin or epidural nerve blockers, analgesics, antibiotics in Gaza? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=362.79999999999995s)]
*  Are any of these things that you've been talking about, or are you just trying to explain to us [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=371.76s)]
*  what you're talking about? I think that's a really good question. I think that's a really good [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=377.76s)]
*  question. Antibiotics in Gaza, are any of those available? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=383.92s)]
*  Oh dear. I fear that this is probably one of the worst situations I have ever faced. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=390.48s)]
*  I've spent 30 years with the United Nations, the majority of my time working on humanitarian [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=398.08s)]
*  situations, and I have never faced a single incident like this. There's just nothing comparable, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=404.0s)]
*  not in the scale, not in the magnitude. I put myself in the shoes of a woman. I'm a woman myself. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=411.2s)]
*  Everyone has a baby in their family that they remember the first time you held that baby, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=420.15999999999997s)]
*  when you looked at them, all of the aspirations and the hopes that you had for this child to grow up, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=425.91999999999996s)]
*  even in the imagination of the parents of the family, those good wishes for this newborn [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=433.28s)]
*  child that brings hope. All of those have been dashed, partly because of the situation and the [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=439.04s)]
*  circumstances that I talked about before, but in part because there are so few health care facilities [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=446.48s)]
*  that can even possibly deliver a baby when something goes wrong. Like you said, many things [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=452.88s)]
*  can go wrong. I think because childbirth is common and a natural event in human reproduction and in [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=459.44s)]
*  human biology and even the social nature of people, we all too often take it for granted. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=468.8s)]
*  In the situation in Gaza, first of all, the anti-natal care before the baby is born. What kind [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=476.40000000000003s)]
*  of care does the mother have? And many women put the health of their unborn child and their family [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=483.04s)]
*  members before themselves. So where food is scarce, where water is scarce, and just for your [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=489.92s)]
*  information, women need three times the amount of water when they're pregnant and lactating than [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=496.64s)]
*  the normal of the average person does. Imagine that you don't even have enough water as a normal, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=502.88s)]
*  regular person, where less than one liter of clean water is available for the day per person. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=509.2s)]
*  Imagine that poor woman who's trying to get her unborn child to safety. Even if you could get to [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=516.72s)]
*  the hospital, we have tried through UNFPA, through our own channels of procurement and delivery, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=523.36s)]
*  to provide a few things. Safe delivery kits for pregnant women in the shelters. And this is a [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=530.5600000000001s)]
*  very simple package, the basics of basic. A clean sheet that's plastic so that it's sterile and clean [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=538.96s)]
*  in this environment where health and hygiene are very scarce. A rope to tie off the umbilical cords. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=546.88s)]
*  Clean sterile scissors. And a bar of soap in the event you can wash your hands. That's it. But it [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=554.4s)]
*  can mean the difference between life and death. And we do deliver the more sophisticated packages [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=561.2s)]
*  of equipment, supplies, epidurals, lots and lots of different types of medications that you mentioned [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=567.84s)]
*  to the hospitals. The situation is so dire that when our technical team was able to get in, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=575.44s)]
*  and it took almost three months before we could get people into Gaza, they were the equipment and [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=583.12s)]
*  supplies were being used directly from the boxes as they came in. The situation was so desperate. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=589.5200000000001s)]
*  And what we're very concerned about is that in any emergency, a physician and the hospital staff [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=596.24s)]
*  who were left, and I really want to salute the hospital staff who have endangered their own lives, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=603.76s)]
*  they put the safety of their and care of their patients before their own, have worked around the [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=609.52s)]
*  clock. But when you have, you're working at 300% capacity with very little supplies, and a pregnant [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=614.88s)]
*  woman comes in for a C-section, and you have people who need an amputation who are bleeding to death, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=623.2s)]
*  the prioritization for pregnant women becomes naturally not secondary, but they are left in [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=630.32s)]
*  the hallways, they're left in the care of lesser trained people, they may have to wait for a while, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=636.96s)]
*  and that is an added burden and an added stress and strain. So this is why we're seeing more [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=643.84s)]
*  fetal death, we're seeing more stillborns, we're seeing more maternal, probably more morbidity than [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=652.0s)]
*  mortality, but the bottom line is we don't know. It's hard to get in there and get accurate numbers, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=658.8s)]
*  unfortunately. Amazing. What can you tell us about caesarean births over the last four months? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=664.56s)]
*  You know, as you mentioned, just horrifying stories about caesareans after death. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=676.7199999999999s)]
*  But, you know, I mean, caesareans, sometimes they need to be done immediately, you know, in very [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=685.36s)]
*  fraught emergency situations. What do you know about the rate of caesareans and the safety of [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=694.16s)]
*  caesareans right now? It's hard for me to give you exact rates. Like I said, the situation is very [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=702.3199999999999s)]
*  precarious. It's always moving and we have had very little access, almost none in the North, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=710.4s)]
*  for example. But even in the areas where there are existing facilities, we get bits and pieces [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=718.7199999999999s)]
*  from the shelters where births are taking place. Just to give you an idea, it's about 180 births [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=725.4399999999999s)]
*  per day. So we have no idea what happens, even if you could get to safety, what happens to those [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=731.76s)]
*  mothers and children afterwards. We only have anecdotal evidence. But let me just give you [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=738.4s)]
*  probably again some of the most difficult circumstances that no human being, no woman, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=745.68s)]
*  and certainly no physician should ever have to be put in that situation where a woman arrives and [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=753.76s)]
*  there is no anesthesia and she needs to undergo a c-section to save her life. And the choice then [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=760.88s)]
*  becomes c-section without anesthesia, without hygienic situations, in some cases that we know [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=767.6s)]
*  of in a corridor, not even in a proper operating theater, and where she would have to go home [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=776.24s)]
*  if she could survive that within the hours, pick up her baby, there may be a blanket or not [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=782.96s)]
*  to wrap the child in and walk. Now for anyone who's ever had surgery, particularly in their [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=790.64s)]
*  lower abdomen, you know that getting up and walking after a few hours and carrying [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=798.2399999999999s)]
*  another small human being is incredibly painful. I can't imagine what goes through the mind of the [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=803.76s)]
*  mother and the poor father who's watching his wife having to go through this, the physician who has [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=812.9599999999999s)]
*  to make that choice, and then what the parents have to endure even if they could survive that. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=819.84s)]
*  For me, it's not only unbearable, it's inhuman to put anyone in that predicament. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=826.72s)]
*  And then assuming that she is able to walk, we're seeing thousands and thousands of people [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=835.4399999999999s)]
*  crammed into these shelters, especially in the South, little to no access to [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=847.04s)]
*  bathrooms, let alone sanitary supplies to change the dressings. I mean, this is major abdominal [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=856.16s)]
*  surgery plus trauma, emotional and physical trauma. What happens after? I mean, I just [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=863.68s)]
*  I have no words to even try to imagine. You know, this must be maybe my 40th interview, if not more. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=877.68s)]
*  And I wonder what it's going to take for people to connect, to say, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=886.1600000000001s)]
*  it's so horrendous to ever have to put someone in that situation. These are the lives of people. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=892.64s)]
*  So when we say that there are 180 births a day, that's 181 women who have to go through [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=899.2s)]
*  excruciatingly painful physically and emotionally circumstances. And then those are the last [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=907.44s)]
*  those are the lives of herself, her new child, maybe other family members, and the community at [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=915.1999999999999s)]
*  large. So for me, it goes way beyond just getting through the safety of that birth, which is [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=923.5999999999999s)]
*  incredibly important. Don't misunderstand me. But I fear for the collective at this point. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=930.16s)]
*  What will it take also for the international community to wake up and say, this is inhumane, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=938.16s)]
*  it's unacceptable, it must stop. And we have to focus on ensuring that everyone, especially women [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=945.44s)]
*  and children who have by no fault of their own, they were just born into Gaza. They just want to [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=953.04s)]
*  live a good life. They want to bring their children into this world with dignity and raise them [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=960.24s)]
*  happily and healthily and are are prohibited from doing that. They are actively actively [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=965.92s)]
*  handcuffed to this situation. This horrendous, I hate to call it a war. It's an aggression, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=973.1999999999999s)]
*  a continuous relentless bombardment of an innocent civilian population. And the Palestinians are [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=979.92s)]
*  paying the price of just being Palestinians. Yeah. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=986.8s)]
*  Leila Bakker, we also know the dire situation for premature infants in NICUs, in the neonatal [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=990.72s)]
*  intensive care units in Gaza. And now as the temperature in Palestine plummets, and there's [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1000.08s)]
*  still no electricity four months in to this genocide, what can you tell us about these [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1006.24s)]
*  fragile babies and their mother's health? Again, exact information we only have in the [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1012.1600000000001s)]
*  facilities that are still functioning. And those are a fraction of the ones that were [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1019.52s)]
*  operating before. I think everyone has seen the heart wrenching pictures when the Israelis [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1024.6399999999999s)]
*  cut off the electricity and the doctors heroically swept in to try and save at least 24 infants, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1032.8s)]
*  carried them through a war torn Gaza under bombardment to safety in another place. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1042.48s)]
*  Right now the situation for many of those babies, which should take a single newborn infant, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1049.76s)]
*  a premature infant, and to one incubator. It was already stressed before. There weren't enough [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1055.92s)]
*  units to take care of the number of births in the hospital facilities. At the moment, there may be [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1062.24s)]
*  three, four newborns in one single unit. Now, while doctors are heroically, again, trying to [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1068.96s)]
*  save the life and doing the best with what they have, the risk of infection, don't forget that a [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1077.76s)]
*  newborn who's that fragile comes with a whole slew of fragility. The lungs are not yet developed [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1082.96s)]
*  usually. There may be other problems with the liver, still not developed enough to fight infection. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1092.0s)]
*  And having those children in those circumstances, those very fragile tiny babies crammed into a [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1099.68s)]
*  single unit decreases the success rate of their lives. It breaks my heart every time I see them. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1105.76s)]
*  And I can't imagine a single person with a human heart who could agree to this aggression. I often [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1114.72s)]
*  tell people, you don't need to know the politics. All you need to know is that there are 2.2 million [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1122.4s)]
*  people of which almost 5,500 women every four weeks who give birth to a baby. Over 5,000 new babies [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1129.28s)]
*  every month coming into this life with no hope and with the fear of being bombarded or dying, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1144.0s)]
*  giving birth. No one should have to have that fear. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1152.4s)]
*  CB You mentioned the home birth or midwifery kits that UNFPA is helping to supply. Can you tell us [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1155.36s)]
*  a little bit more about the home birth and midwifery community in Gaza, especially as [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1170.32s)]
*  what you've been describing in terms of hospital births is horrific and there are no basic supplies [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1176.16s)]
*  or medicine. What can you tell us about the community there in Gaza? [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1189.04s)]
*  LW Well, first of all, luckily, we have been training people on community-based birth attendance [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1196.24s)]
*  who are not physicians but trained midwives, nurses, etc. And who can both do the delivery, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1206.3999999999999s)]
*  assuming that it's an uncomplicated delivery, a normal delivery. In normal circumstances, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1213.52s)]
*  when there isn't a war, that could be about 85% of the births, which is a pretty good ratio. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1218.96s)]
*  There are a few things that hinder that. The first, of course, is the fact that those skilled [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1225.6799999999998s)]
*  birth attendants, those midwives, those nurses who are embedded in the community are hard pressed [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1232.56s)]
*  to find. And in the majority of cases, because over 95% of the population is now themselves [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1239.28s)]
*  finding themselves in a place of internal displacement, forced displacement. So they are [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1246.7199999999998s)]
*  without their normal situation. They are not in, they don't have their normal equipment with them. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1252.48s)]
*  And they certainly don't have the communication system, the phone lines, the internets that would [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1259.76s)]
*  enable them to provide that support unless they're in the same shelter. So we've tried to do a few [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1264.88s)]
*  things. One is that where you have the most skilled midwives, we've tried to put them in the [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1271.8400000000001s)]
*  facilities where they will be needed to support the other health professionals to deliver the more [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1276.64s)]
*  complicated cases of hemorrhage, of the needed emergency C-sections. And we've tried to identify [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1282.0800000000002s)]
*  in some of the more cramped shelters. And by cramped, I think that's a gross underestimation. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1291.0400000000002s)]
*  A shelter that should be housing 400 people has 23,000, for example. But we've tried to identify [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1298.5600000000002s)]
*  who has experience in birthing. We have provided them to the best of our ability, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1306.08s)]
*  but we are hindered from bringing in those supplies. Both a clean delivery kit, and that was the one [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1312.48s)]
*  that I described that has the sheet and scissors and a bar of soap. And there's a slightly more [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1318.96s)]
*  advanced one as well that has suturing that has gauze and that can help a midwife also bring the [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1324.0s)]
*  baby into the world and also wrap them in a thermal sheet. Right now, there aren't clean [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1331.36s)]
*  blankets. It's cold, like you said. So we want something to keep the mother warm, something to [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1338.24s)]
*  keep the baby warm. And this is just a thermal piece of plastic with, it kind of looks a little [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1343.6799999999998s)]
*  bit astronautic, if you might imagine that, a piece of plastic with some silver foil on the other [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1349.36s)]
*  side. But it does retain the heat for the mother and for the child so that at least they don't [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1355.04s)]
*  freeze to death in giving birth. It's really awful. I can't even imagine. I really can't. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1361.6s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And as I mentioned in the beginning, there have been reports about menstruating women [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1372.8s)]
*  having to use scraps of cloth and other scavenged materials leading to infections. How are girls [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1382.72s)]
*  and women able to take care of themselves while they're on their period? What do they need right [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1390.1599999999999s)]
*  now and what is most pressing? Thank you for the question. Most people, again, because menstruation [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1396.08s)]
*  in the Middle East is considered a private matter. But many girls, especially in this new generation, [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1408.48s)]
*  if you're getting your period and you're an adolescent girl, you're finding yourself in [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1419.4399999999998s)]
*  your womanhood. And it can be also a moment where really you're starting to feel proud, you're [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1424.16s)]
*  developing your own sense of self and coming into a new era of your own life. It does require a [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1431.0400000000002s)]
*  few things, though. It does require understanding of that process. We haven't been able to continue [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1439.2s)]
*  with that. It can be a very scary moment for people who don't understand what's happening, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1445.6000000000001s)]
*  especially if this is your first period. There aren't enough supplies and it requires a [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1451.36s)]
*  commercial market. And here is where we say the U.N. is not a replacement for the commercial market. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1456.56s)]
*  There is an onus of responsibility on the occupying force, in this case Israel, to keep the border [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1462.4799999999998s)]
*  open and to maintain commercial flows so that the market is available. Not having menstrual hygiene [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1468.3999999999999s)]
*  products available in the local market and at the level that they can accommodate nearly 700,000 [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1477.04s)]
*  menstruating women and girls every month means a few things. One is that you're going to use [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1484.08s)]
*  whatever you have. You'll cut the tent up, you'll use your sweater, you'll do whatever it takes, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1490.72s)]
*  because again, you don't want to be embarrassed. And it can be, it can have a long-lasting [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1496.32s)]
*  mental impact on many of the women and girls that we're seeing. The second impact is that [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1502.72s)]
*  given the unhygienic situations in the cramped quarters where there could be a thousand women [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1509.28s)]
*  to one single toilet facility, the ability to even maintain hygiene, much less during your period, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1515.6000000000001s)]
*  is pretty scarce. And so we are worried about not having enough products, certainly about not having [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1523.68s)]
*  enough dignity to be able to manage your menstruation. Thirdly, about the infections, [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1531.36s)]
*  because people will use whatever they have. And we have evidence that parents are also trying [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1536.7199999999998s)]
*  to locate contraceptive pills that would suppress a period so that you don't have to deal with it. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1544.4799999999998s)]
*  I can't imagine giving contraceptive pills to a 12-year-old girl where no physician has checked her [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1551.04s)]
*  and where her period is just starting. The long-lasting impact of all of those concerns [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1558.24s)]
*  that we're seeing on the ground, I think we'll only know as the stability hopefully comes to Gaza, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1564.16s)]
*  and we're able to really go in at scale and support the community there. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1571.6s)]
*  Yeah. Finally, and you mentioned some of these at the beginning, but what are some stories or [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1576.56s)]
*  reports that you're reading that keep you up at night? And how are UN workers or agencies able [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1585.84s)]
*  to operate in these conditions? I mean, what about your colleagues on the ground in Gaza? [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1593.44s)]
*  What's that like for them? [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1600.56s)]
*  My poor colleagues have been displaced like everyone else. Two of my colleagues were in the [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1606.48s)]
*  Hanira's training center. They were two women, very well-educated, one of them handling our [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1614.48s)]
*  gender-based violence program, and one of them handling, strangely enough, our sexual reproductive [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1621.6s)]
*  health and emergencies program. Both of them had children, beautiful, healthy, vibrant. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1628.32s)]
*  One of the colleagues had a baby that was a little less than 10 months when the aggression started. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1637.76s)]
*  Within the first month, the baby had lost five kilograms of weight, five kilograms. Now, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1645.6799999999998s)]
*  this is my colleague who has a master's degree, is well-educated, very sophisticated, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1652.48s)]
*  a wonderful colleague to work with. And I have seven wonderful colleagues who are Palestinian, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1659.2s)]
*  who have worked tirelessly, Mustafa, who's given everything that he has, not thinking about his [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1665.92s)]
*  own life in some cases to deliver a safe birthing kit or get water supplies to the other colleagues. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1673.84s)]
*  But as we've seen, there's no place safe in Gaza. And the so-called evacuation orders into safety [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1682.72s)]
*  we've seen are false. The attacks on the UN facilities are a gross violation. The attacks [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1692.24s)]
*  on hospitals, all of the civilian infrastructure. And for us, what keeps me up at night is the fact [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1699.92s)]
*  that we as the international community have failed the Palestinian people and the people of Gaza. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1707.12s)]
*  And I put myself in that category because for everything that we have tried to do, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1715.1999999999998s)]
*  our secretary general has been very vocal about it. Our executive director, Natalia Kanem, at [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1720.6399999999999s)]
*  every turn speaks about saving the lives of women and girls and protecting the civilian [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1727.1999999999998s)]
*  population of Palestine in Gaza. But it falls on deaf ears and the narrative is constantly [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1733.52s)]
*  derailed by propaganda, by a lot of misinformation, and by the continued aggression that just [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1741.76s)]
*  never seems to desist. And I think that's what troubles me most is that in this world where the [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1751.92s)]
*  United Nations is the only entity that really still tries to uphold universal rights, we are [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1758.72s)]
*  unable to garner our member states to see the legitimacy of the Palestinian people's right to [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1766.08s)]
*  self-determination, for people to live in peace and dignity, and to allow for those women and girls [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1773.84s)]
*  to grow up safely and securely without any fear of dying. Not as a girl, not as a woman [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1780.4s)]
*  who wants to have a family of her own, and certainly not in childbirth. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1788.24s)]
*  Is there a way that people around the world can support the UNFPA in terms of helping to deliver [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1796.16s)]
*  these labor and delivery kits? Is there any way that I know that people will [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1806.72s)]
*  be emailing and asking how they can be a part of that? [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1810.96s)]
*  We have an individual giving campaign, and I have to say that we raise the most, [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1814.6399999999999s)]
*  we always have this for all of our crises, and Palestine has garnered the most money for that. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1820.72s)]
*  On UNFPA's website, you can go, you can look at the individual giving campaign, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1827.9199999999998s)]
*  you can dedicate it to someone. You can also help, and I must say here that UNRWA is under [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1833.36s)]
*  an enormous amount of strain. I urge everyone to campaign to ensure that the United Nations [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1840.24s)]
*  Relief and Works Agency continues to work and flourish. They are the largest protectorate of [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1847.84s)]
*  the Palestinian refugee community in Gaza, and they have been actively denied funding to continue [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1854.32s)]
*  their work after what I would consider unsubstantiated allegations that the UN [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1864.0s)]
*  is investigating. But I urge you to give both to UNRWA, to UNFPA, and to continue locally wherever [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1871.6s)]
*  you are. Let people understand what's going on. Give them the information. Take from our website, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1880.32s)]
*  and if you need anything, we have a huge number of people who are happy to speak to your communities, [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1887.36s)]
*  to provide you with more information. I think really just countering a lot of that disinformation [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1893.44s)]
*  that's out there, please continue to do so, and we're happy to step in if you need any other support. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYMmlxo71oc&t=1900.0800000000002s)]
