# Honoring Dr. Refaat Alareer on day 66 of Gaza's Al-Aqsa Flood | The Electronic Intifada Podcast
**The Electronic Intifada:** [December 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw)
*  Hello and welcome back to the Electronic Intifada livestream for Monday, December 11th, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=0.0s)]
*  a day of global strike for Palestine. I'm Nora Barrows-Freedman with my colleagues Asa Wyn Stanley, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=28.64s)]
*  John Elmer, Tamara Nassar, and Ali Abunimah. We're taking this episode to mourn, to grieve, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=35.84s)]
*  and to celebrate the life of our dear friend Dr. Rifat Al-Arir. Thank you all for joining us. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  I know that people got to meet Rifat perhaps for the first time during our live streams over the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=49.84s)]
*  past two months of this relentless slaughter in Gaza. There are others who have known Rifat [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=54.72s)]
*  for decades and will be joined on this show today by many of his friends and students around the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=60.64s)]
*  world who have had the exquisite joy of knowing and being known by Rifat. We'll also have some [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=66.64s)]
*  videos recorded by some of his former students in Gaza who sent them to us and who cannot join us [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=73.92s)]
*  live today because of the lack of internet connection as Israel continues to try and cut [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=79.2s)]
*  Gaza off from the world. For those who knew and loved the Rifat and his work, we wanted to present [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=84.48s)]
*  today's episode as a virtual Azzam, a condolence visit where people can come and express to Rifat's [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=91.44s)]
*  family and community how much he meant to them and to carry on his work and love for his people [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=98.56s)]
*  and this world and will be able to send this episode to his family so they can accept these [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=104.24s)]
*  condolences. I kept thinking over the last four days that Rifat would want us to be angry at his [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=109.52s)]
*  death but wouldn't want us to despair. He wouldn't have wanted Israel to steal our time that way. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=116.88s)]
*  He told us, he told you Ali, on one of our live streams that we haven't given into barbarity [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  and that we won't let them make us give into despair and defeatism. We refuse and that is [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=129.6s)]
*  what the enemy feared in Rifat and what it fears in every Palestinian in all of us the most. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=135.92s)]
*  Rifat epitomized dignity and courage and bravery, everything that the enemy who stole his life will [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=143.44s)]
*  never have the privilege of experiencing. I miss him. I miss joking with him. I miss seeing that [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=150.56s)]
*  glint in his eye and his smile and I'm angry. I'm angry for his wife and his kids and for the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=158.32s)]
*  thousands of students who won't get to sit in a classroom with him and for the papers and the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=164.95999999999998s)]
*  essays and the poems that he won't write and yet I know and we know that the seeds he planted are [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=170.64s)]
*  growing into a vast forest all around the world, that he is immortal, he is with us, he is inside [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=177.68s)]
*  each expo marker and each blackboard and each kite that will ever fly over Gaza in a liberated [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=185.52s)]
*  Palestine. Ali, I want to turn it over to you for your opening remarks. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=193.20000000000002s)]
*  Thanks, Nora. On our program last Thursday, I mentioned that we hadn't heard from Rifat [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  and some of our other friends in Gaza for several days. I told you, as I reassured myself, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=206.0s)]
*  that this was most likely due to the failing electricity and connectivity between Gaza and [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=212.4s)]
*  the world. We'd had these silences before, sometimes for days, and I felt sure that before long, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=218.24s)]
*  Rifat's name would pop up in my notifications with his typical phrase, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=225.20000000000002s)]
*  we are fine, or one of his notorious jokes. Instead, moments after we ended the live stream, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=229.68s)]
*  I received a message from a mutual friend, Ali, Rifat is dead. Like everyone who heard these words, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=236.16s)]
*  I refused to believe them and part of me still doesn't. I'm still somehow waiting for a response [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=243.6s)]
*  to my last message, Rifat, any news? What we know is that on Wednesday, Rifat was at the home of his [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=249.84s)]
*  sister in the El Sidra neighborhood of Gaza City. At about 6 p.m., a missile was fired at the building, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=258.08s)]
*  killing Rifat, his brother Salah and Salah's son, Muhammad, and Rifat's sister, Asma, and three of [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=265.04s)]
*  her children, Alaa, Yahya, and Muhammad. The airstrike surgically targeted the apartment on the second [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=271.6s)]
*  floor and not the entire building, indicating the apartment was the target, according to the [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=278.56s)]
*  human rights group, Euromed. Rifat was 44 years old. A close friend of Rifat told Euromed that [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=284.64000000000004s)]
*  days before he was murdered, Rifat had received an anonymous call from someone who identified [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=293.12s)]
*  himself as an Israeli officer and threatened Rifat that they knew precisely which school he was [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=299.44s)]
*  sheltering in and that advancing Israeli forces would soon reach his location. That call prompted [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=305.28000000000003s)]
*  Rifat to move to his sister's apartment, thinking it was less conspicuous than the overcrowded school. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=312.0s)]
*  I'm certain too that if had left the school because he did not want to endanger other people [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=318.32s)]
*  by being there. Yesterday, I was able to reach Rifat's wife Nusayba on the phone at a shelter [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=323.84s)]
*  in Gaza to convey our condolences to her and their children, Shayma, Omar, Ahmad, Lena, and Amal. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=331.28s)]
*  I told her how much Rifat meant to us and asked if she had seen any of the many tributes to Rifat. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=338.96s)]
*  Did she know that people around the world are raising Rifat's picture and reading and [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=345.28s)]
*  translating his words? We don't know anything, she said. We have no internet, no connection, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=349.84s)]
*  just the telephone. She said that Rifat used to travel long distances to try to find internet [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=356.96s)]
*  so he could connect to the world and continue his work. So part of the reason, as Nora said, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=363.44s)]
*  that we pay tribute to Rifat today is so that his family will one day soon, in better days, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=369.44s)]
*  be able to see for themselves how much Rifat meant to the world. Those of you who've watched [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=376.0s)]
*  Rifat's appearances on these live streams and have read his articles for the electronic intifada in [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=382.32s)]
*  the last two months know that he and his family had already been displaced several times after [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=388.24s)]
*  Israel bombed their home in late October. Despite having to care for his own family, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=395.04s)]
*  Rifat never stopped helping others, carrying water and doing other tasks in the shelters. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=401.52000000000004s)]
*  He never complained about discomfort despite the appalling and dangerous conditions, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=407.68s)]
*  the most appalling conditions humans can face. Anytime I asked him how he was, he would eventually [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=413.28000000000003s)]
*  text back, we are fine. Over these last two horrifying months, Rifat comforted me much more [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=420.16s)]
*  than I could comfort him, and I know that's true for many of us. I treasure the memories of the [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=428.8s)]
*  time I spent with Rifat in person in Washington, Philadelphia, Chicago, and California when he came [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=435.52000000000004s)]
*  to the United States in 2014 with Yousef El Jamal and Rowan Yary to speak about Gaza rights back. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=442.32000000000005s)]
*  A collection of short stories by young writers edited by Rifat and published by Just World Books. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=450.24s)]
*  One cold night in Chicago became a legend. The night Rifat tasted deep dish pizza at Giordano's [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=458.24s)]
*  in Hyde Park near the University of Chicago. That night is still etched in my mind, heart, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=465.52000000000004s)]
*  and stomach, Rifat wrote to me on October 31st. Rifat spent his last few days walking the streets [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=471.76000000000005s)]
*  of his beloved Gaza City alongside his friend Asim el-Nabi, who has known Rifat since childhood. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=479.84s)]
*  Asim, who works for the Gaza municipality, said Rifat tried to help anyone he could, directing [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=488.08s)]
*  those looking for a place to go towards neighborhoods where he thought they could find a little more [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=495.52s)]
*  safety. And while doing all this, Rifat continued to write, continued to support his students, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=501.03999999999996s)]
*  and continued to do his life's work. Asim said of Rifat, he could have lived and worked anywhere [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=507.76s)]
*  in the world and lived the best life, but he refused. Indeed, after his studies in Britain [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=514.3199999999999s)]
*  and Malaysia, Rifat insisted on returning to Gaza and building a future there, not just for himself, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=520.72s)]
*  but for his country. Rifat was the proud son of a laborer in Gaza City's Shujia district [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=528.0s)]
*  and a professor of English at IUG, the Islamic University of Gaza. He was a co-founder of We [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=535.2s)]
*  Are Not Numbers, a project launched in Gaza after Israel's 2014 attack to mentor and support young [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=541.9200000000001s)]
*  writers in the besieged territory to tell their stories to the world. It is through We Are Not [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=548.96s)]
*  Numbers and Rifat's work that the electronic intifada has been introduced to many of its finest [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=554.72s)]
*  writers in and from Gaza, some of whom you will meet today. Like so many Palestinians, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=561.92s)]
*  Rifat's earliest memories were marred by Israeli violence. In his chapter in the recent book, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=568.8s)]
*  Light in Gaza, published by Haymarket Books, Rifat writes about how both his father and mother were [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=575.04s)]
*  nearly killed on separate occasions by Israeli bullets and shells. As a child, he himself was [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=581.76s)]
*  shot by Israeli soldiers with rubber-coated steel bullets, and on one occasion an Israeli soldier [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=588.64s)]
*  threw a rocket at him from the roof of a building, injuring him in the head. Even before this genocide, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=594.72s)]
*  Rifat and Moseiba had between them lost dozens of relatives to Israel's decades of savagery. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=602.24s)]
*  In 2014, Israel bombed Moseiba's sister's home, killing her sister and husband and several of [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=609.4399999999999s)]
*  her sister's children. This horrifying toll, Rifat wrote in a May 2021 op-ed for the New York Times, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=616.16s)]
*  made them a perfectly average Palestinian couple. Rifat's first piece for the electronic intifada [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=624.0s)]
*  in 2014 told the story of his martyred brother, Muhammad, or Hamada, who is beloved by thousands [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=632.48s)]
*  of children in Gaza for his character, Karkur, a mischievous chicken on the TV program Tomorrow's [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=639.84s)]
*  Pioneers. Rifat's weapon was the pen, and sometimes the expo marker. In 1997, as an undergraduate, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=647.6800000000001s)]
*  he chose to major in English literature. He explains in Light in Gaza, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=656.8000000000001s)]
*  I remember when I first heard the question, how many more Palestinians should be massacred for the world [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=669.84s)]
*  to care about our lives? I thought naively that repeating the question would change people, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=675.84s)]
*  but Israel kept killing us and Israel kept destroying our lives. But Rifat was never [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=681.84s)]
*  discouraged, only more determined to use language to change minds and change the world. He learned [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=688.96s)]
*  the power of stories to comfort and move people in the most visceral way during Operation Cast Led, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=696.16s)]
*  Israel's barbaric bombardment of Gaza in December 2008 and January 2009. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=703.28s)]
*  Rifat writes, I remember during the onslaught, spending 23 days telling my little kids, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=710.3199999999999s)]
*  Shayma, Omar, and Ahmed, many stories to distract them. Some were stories my mother told me as a child, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=716.48s)]
*  or variations on her stories, featuring my children as the heroes and saviors every now and then. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=723.68s)]
*  Even though bombs and missiles could be heard in the background, my children were transfixed, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=731.04s)]
*  listening to my stories like never before. Rifat adds, during the 2008-2009 attacks on Gaza, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=737.4399999999999s)]
*  the more bombs Israel detonated, the more stories I told. Telling stories was my way of resisting, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=746.3199999999999s)]
*  it was all I could do. And it was then that I decided that if I lived, I would dedicate [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=753.6s)]
*  much of my life to telling the stories of Palestine, empowering Palestinian narratives, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=760.0s)]
*  and nurturing younger voices. And that is how Rifat spent his life to the very last day, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=765.84s)]
*  inside and outside the classroom. I do not want even to dignify with a response [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=772.72s)]
*  the vicious character assassination against Rifat that Zionists have engaged in, both to incite his [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=780.16s)]
*  murder beforehand and to celebrate it in the most depraved way afterwards. I will say that those who [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=787.04s)]
*  incited against him have his blood on their hands. But I do want to affirm here that despite the [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=794.0s)]
*  savagery Israel inflicted on his own family and on his people since his earliest days, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=800.7199999999999s)]
*  Rifat always taught that we should see the humanity in everyone, but first and foremost [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=807.36s)]
*  in those who are demonized, marginalized, and despised. As we will hear today, Rifat loved to [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=813.6s)]
*  teach Shakespeare, not merely in appreciation of Elizabethan verse, but as a tool for his students [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=821.04s)]
*  to understand the world they live in and challenge its orthodoxies. Rifat writes, perhaps the most [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=827.52s)]
*  emotional moment in my six-year teaching career in IUG's English department was when I asked my [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=835.2s)]
*  students which character they identified with more, Othello with his Arab origins or Shylock, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=841.6800000000001s)]
*  the Jew. Most students felt they were closer to Shylock and more sympathetic to him than Othello. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=848.5600000000001s)]
*  Only then did I realize that I had managed to help my students grow and shatter the prejudices [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=855.76s)]
*  they had grown up with because of the occupation and the siege. Everyone who knows Rifat knows that [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=862.0s)]
*  he loved his students. On November the 2nd, just a few days after his house was bombed, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=869.52s)]
*  Rifat wrote to me how sad he felt that the thousands of books he had collected over 30 years [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=875.76s)]
*  had been destroyed. The books can be replaced, Rifat. You cannot, I responded in an effort to [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=882.0s)]
*  console him. He replied, all those pieces you publish for my students keep me going. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=889.2s)]
*  And when Rifat's house, family's house in Shujiaia was destroyed by Israel in 2014, he walked through [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=896.5600000000001s)]
*  the rubble with his friend Asim. Asim remembers that Rifat picked up the burned and charred papers [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=903.6800000000001s)]
*  with the poems and stories written by his students as if he had found a valuable treasure. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=911.2s)]
*  Rifat is now among at least 17,700 martyrs in Israel's genocide. His story is just one among [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=917.84s)]
*  millions and no one knew that better than Rifat. One day before he was murdered by Israel, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=926.5600000000001s)]
*  Rifat told Asim, if God lets me survive this war, I want to devote the rest of my life to telling [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=933.2800000000001s)]
*  the stories of the people here. Rifat won't be able to do that, so the task falls to us. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=940.96s)]
*  If I must die, let it bring hope, let it be a tale. Rifat is now the fourth contributor to the [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=948.72s)]
*  electronic intifada known to have been murdered by Israel since October 7th. Before him were Huda [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=956.32s)]
*  Al-Susi, Ra'ed Qaddurah and Mohammed Hammo. All three were Rifat's students or mentees. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=963.68s)]
*  Rifat's murder is part of Israel's systematic extermination of the Palestinian [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=971.12s)]
*  intelligentsia in Gaza, including prominent doctors, researchers and dozens of journalists. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=977.1999999999999s)]
*  Just days before killing Rifat, Israel assassinated Dr. Sufyan Tayeh, a prominent scientist and the [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=984.16s)]
*  president of IUG. The poet and activist Ahmed Aburtema, a regular contributor to the electronic [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=991.44s)]
*  intifada, survived an Israeli assassination attempt in October that killed his 13-year-old son, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=998.6400000000001s)]
*  Abdullah, and several other members of his family. In light in Gaza, Rifat writes, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1005.2s)]
*  the wounds Israel inflicted in the hearts of Palestinians are not irreparable. We have no [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1012.1600000000001s)]
*  choice but to recover, stand up again and continue the struggle. Submitting to the [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1018.72s)]
*  occupation is a betrayal of humanity and to all the struggles around the world. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1024.8s)]
*  Rifat embodied everything Israel hates and seeks to destroy. Knowledge, compassion, empathy, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1031.1200000000001s)]
*  selflessness and the determination to resist its savagery and tyranny and seek liberation, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1038.56s)]
*  no matter what the price. That is why Israel killed him and that is why, through all of us here, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1045.04s)]
*  Rifat and his mission will continue to live. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1051.76s)]
*  Thank you so much, Ali. And before we go to our first guest, we wanted to show this very short [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1055.6s)]
*  reading and animation someone did on Twitter of Rifat's poem, If I Must Die, that we thought was [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1064.3999999999999s)]
*  beautiful. Let's go to that. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1072.1599999999999s)]
*  Let it bring hope. Let it be attained. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1115.12s)]
*  And since the news of Rifat's murder, people have been commemorating and grieving him around the [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1122.96s)]
*  world and that poem of his has been translated now into at least 260 different languages. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1129.2s)]
*  It's a way that people all over the world are keeping his words alive and universal and immortal. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1137.6s)]
*  We wanted to show some of those translations. Again, more than 260. The thread around social [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1144.48s)]
*  media has just been going and going and going and it is just beautiful and a testament [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1152.6399999999999s)]
*  to how poignant and relevant and yes, universal and immortal Rifat's words are and will continue [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1159.9199999999998s)]
*  to be. So we encourage you to go mostly on Twitter, I think, but I'm sure it's on other [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1172.56s)]
*  platforms as well and just look at these incredible translations. It's just kind of [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1179.36s)]
*  overwhelming for sure. We wanted to bring in our first guest. We're joined by Yusuf Al-Jamal. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1186.6399999999999s)]
*  Yusuf is a Palestinian writer and close friend of Rifat, who is also his student. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1194.8s)]
*  Yusuf, it's really good to have you. It's unbearable to be talking about Rifat in the past tense. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1200.72s)]
*  Thanks for being with us today. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1212.3999999999999s)]
*  Thank you for making the memory of Rifat alive. I will never talk about Rifat in the past tense. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1215.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1223.6799999999998s)]
*  I think Rifat is immortal. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1225.52s)]
*  I felt so sad when I knew that he's stuck under the rubble, but also I thought maybe he will [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1230.8799999999999s)]
*  rise from under the rubble, just like the phoenix, the famous bird that lived in Arabia and [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1242.8s)]
*  that was taken by the Gaza municipality as its symbol, just rising from ashes. This is how we [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1251.04s)]
*  have known Rifat, very energetic, full of life, full of jokes. I have known him since 2007. This [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1259.6s)]
*  is the year he returned back to Gaza and started teaching after obtaining his master degree in [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1271.1999999999998s)]
*  comparative literature at UCL. That was my first year in the English department. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1277.6s)]
*  You know, Rifat was my teacher at the time and he continues to be my guide forever. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1285.9199999999998s)]
*  He taught me English literature and translation. I took two courses with him and he was very mean [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1293.6s)]
*  with grades, but he was very tough. But if you earn a grade with Rifat, then it's well deserved. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1302.3999999999999s)]
*  I learned things I never learned elsewhere in his class. We studied about politics, literature, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1310.72s)]
*  language, philosophy, history, cinema. He was an encyclopedia in many different ways. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1317.76s)]
*  Then our friendship continued and I'm not an exception to this. There are many students he [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1328.64s)]
*  taught who later became his close friends. He would invite us outside the classroom. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1335.6000000000001s)]
*  He would always challenge us and give us homework just to make us think critically. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1342.96s)]
*  Rifat was universal in his classroom. He taught American, English, African, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1349.8400000000001s)]
*  Irish literature. That's why he was also universal in his passing. There are a lot of people [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1356.08s)]
*  remembering Rifat now and translating his poem. I enjoyed also helping him train young people in [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1364.8s)]
*  Gaza, providing logistics and organizing the training and the training of the students. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1374.3999999999999s)]
*  He encouraged me to write too. I wrote my first article for the Electronic Intifada in 2012, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1383.2s)]
*  the killing of my brother and why I have two brothers named Omar. I remember how Rifat was [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1387.76s)]
*  so happy when the article was published. He was very happy. He was very happy when I wrote it. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1395.3600000000001s)]
*  He was always praising me and encouraging me to write more. Then he suggested that I turn this [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1401.76s)]
*  feature into a short story, which I did, and then he published this story in Gaza right back. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1409.6s)]
*  We traveled the United States and we were in the United States. We traveled to the United States [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1416.16s)]
*  and we were in the United States. We traveled to the United States and we were in the United States. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1422.4s)]
*  I wrote a short story in Gaza right back. We traveled the United States in 2014, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1428.16s)]
*  Rawan and Rifat and I talking about Gaza right back and the power of fiction. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1432.8000000000002s)]
*  Rifat always believed that fiction is universal and it's timeless. It will be read [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1439.3600000000001s)]
*  100 years later as if it's written now. That's why he also encouraged his students to write [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1447.1200000000001s)]
*  literature and he believed in the power of literature. He himself was a poet. As you know, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1454.8s)]
*  he published If I Must Die. He published this poem actually in 2011 and he only penned his [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1460.6399999999999s)]
*  poem to his timeline in November. Maybe he felt like his killing is a high possibility because of [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1470.08s)]
*  Israel's genocide. He also wrote another poem titled I Am You. Rifat was a humanist in many [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1481.52s)]
*  different ways. He even tried to speak to the psyche of his murderers, Israeli soldiers, telling [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1490.6399999999999s)]
*  them I am you. Again, I feel so sad, but I also remember Rifat as the greatest [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1498.96s)]
*  owner of all senses of humor, especially brutal and dark humor. Even people who do not know us [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1509.8400000000001s)]
*  would sometimes think that we have an abusive relationship because of his jokes. I always [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1521.8400000000001s)]
*  enjoyed these jokes. Wherever he went to, he left a mark. There is a chair in our friend's house in [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1528.32s)]
*  Washington, D.C. called Rifat's chair. I remember when we had the pizza and he was making fun of [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1535.12s)]
*  the deep dish pizza and comparing it to the New York pizza. The memories he leaves and creates [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1543.12s)]
*  stays forever. Rifat also took me in his own home for three weeks when I did not have a home in [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1550.8s)]
*  Malaysia. Not just like a teacher and a friend, but a great human being. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1559.04s)]
*  We traveled Malaysia, we traveled the United States together. He always thought about his students [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1566.88s)]
*  inside Gaza and outside Gaza too. He sent me a number of articles written by his students. He [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1574.24s)]
*  was also so happy when he saw them being published. His students were the center of his life. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1583.04s)]
*  That is why everyone is sad and remembering Rifat and telling their beautiful memories with [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1591.76s)]
*  Rifat. I remember when we were in the United States, we spoke at different, multiple places. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1600.48s)]
*  And Rifat also managed to leave a very positive impact on people he met. We have seen this [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1606.16s)]
*  actually in Philadelphia recently. There was a group of people who organized a vigil in memory [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1614.24s)]
*  of Rifat who met him in 2014. People still remember him up until now. It has been 10 years, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1625.6000000000001s)]
*  or nine years since we visited Philadelphia together. He loved Gaza. He always told people [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1633.8400000000001s)]
*  that he is the son of Shigaea, his hometown in Gaza. I remember we walked over the [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1642.48s)]
*  Brooklyn Bridge, Jihad, Rifat and I. And Rifat wrote the name of his town on the bridge, Shigaea, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1652.88s)]
*  and he took a picture. He was always proud of his town, telling people everywhere that Shigaea is [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1659.84s)]
*  like New York, known by everyone, and he wanted Shigaea to be known by everyone. I'm very sad, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1666.8s)]
*  and you know that his life was cut short, but I am sure that Rifat will continue to live in the [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1674.6399999999999s)]
*  hearts of thousands of people, hundreds of his students, but also millions of people around the [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1682.16s)]
*  world who are translating his poem today. Because Rifat believed in the power of literature and [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1689.44s)]
*  writing, and he knew very well that his writings will live for a long time. And we've seen this. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1696.3200000000002s)]
*  You know, 260 languages is a huge number. Maybe there is no other poem that was translated into [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1707.12s)]
*  260 languages. And this is a message to all of us that we should continue writing and defending [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1714.08s)]
*  our cause as Rifat wanted. Rifat is the storyteller of Gaza, the father of storytelling in Gaza, and [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1721.52s)]
*  Rifat is also an idea. He's immortal, and ideas do not die. He will always be there. We will see [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1732.16s)]
*  him. We feel him watching over us and guiding us every day in our life. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1739.1200000000001s)]
*  Yousef Al-Jammu, thank you so much. I wanted to bring on two of our other friends. First, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1748.24s)]
*  I did want to say that the animation and voiceover of that poem that we just showed [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1756.88s)]
*  right before you came on was by someone named Maya, and her handle on Twitter is Maya Amartu. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1764.16s)]
*  And the song was sung by Nye Borguti. And thank you so much to David Alvarez for [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1772.64s)]
*  giving us that information. That's really valuable. Thank you, Maya, for making that. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1779.92s)]
*  So I wanted to bring on two more guests. Jehad Abu-Salam, Palestinian writer and former student [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1784.16s)]
*  of Rifat, and also Shaima Ziyara, a Palestinian from Gaza, also a friend and former student. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1798.3200000000002s)]
*  Shaima and Jehad, thank you so much for being here today. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1805.52s)]
*  You're both muted. So Shaima, let's start with you. Talk about your friendship with Rifat and [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1810.8s)]
*  and how you came to be his student. Thank you, Nora. I first met Rifat back in 2008, [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1821.68s)]
*  so that's over 15 years ago. I was only 14 years old back then, and he was my teacher in a youth [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1831.12s)]
*  program. At that time, I was a young, malleable mind, and it was an honor to have been his student [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1838.08s)]
*  and to get the privilege to have my whole worldview shaped by him. He introduced us to Malcolm X. He [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1846.3999999999999s)]
*  taught us about the Black Liberation Movement and helped us draw comparisons with Palestinian [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1854.0s)]
*  struggle for liberation. He taught us about Edward Said's Orientalism. He encouraged us to [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1860.8s)]
*  think critically, to thoughtfully engage with literary characters we didn't necessarily agree with. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1867.84s)]
*  He taught us to see humanity in everyone. Rifat is the reason I am who I am today. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1874.96s)]
*  He didn't treat us like we were children. He never made us feel like he knows better than us. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1882.3999999999999s)]
*  He treated us like great, capable minds, even when we were just, you know, foolish teenagers. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1888.32s)]
*  In class, he liked to inject his lessons with humor. He would tell great jokes, but also a lot [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1895.12s)]
*  of lame ones do. He liked to tease his students. It was almost like a bonding exercise for him. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1901.36s)]
*  He loved telling us about his mischievous shenanigans as a young kid and as a university [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1910.8799999999999s)]
*  student. And even at that time, he would tell us about the pranks he would pull on his friends [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1916.88s)]
*  as an adult. He never lost his sense of humor, even in the darkest of times that we're seeing [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1922.3200000000002s)]
*  right now. Rifat grew and we grew under his wings. When I went to university, he was also [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1929.44s)]
*  my professor, and I looked forward to every single class of his. We were discussing Shakespeare, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1936.4s)]
*  performing soliloquies, writing poetry. We looked up to him like a big brother, like a friend. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1943.28s)]
*  That you know will always be there for you and will give you the best advice whenever you go for [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1951.28s)]
*  him for advice. In early November, when my brother, Ahmad, was severely injured in an Israeli bombing, [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1956.8799999999999s)]
*  Rifat was texting me almost every day whenever he gets a connection and he would ask about him. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1966.3999999999999s)]
*  My brother and I, by the way, share the names of Rifat's eldest children, Shaymar and Omar. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1972.32s)]
*  When my brother succumbed to his wounds, Rifat was devastated. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1978.6399999999999s)]
*  He was the dynamite behind the freelance work of the youth in Gaza, Rifat said. And even in the [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1984.32s)]
*  darkest of times when he was worried for his safety and for his family's safety, Rifat still made the [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1990.48s)]
*  time to check on me and my loved ones. In one of his interviews with Electronic and Tifada [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=1996.64s)]
*  on the livestream, he was talking about how bleak and dark the situation is. And [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2004.88s)]
*  that's when he broke down crying, seeing that really broke my heart. Because Rifat was always [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2010.96s)]
*  smiling, always quick with the witty, snarky remarks. He was overcome with grief. But by the [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2018.0s)]
*  end of that sentence, you could hear him regain his strength. And his voice getting stronger and [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2024.96s)]
*  becoming even more determined. Because that was Rifat, that's who he was. Like a phoenix, [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2030.88s)]
*  he would always rise up from the ashes. And today he still rises up through his legacy, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2038.24s)]
*  through his words, his poems, his stories, and the minds that he has shaped. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2045.1200000000001s)]
*  Just like in the poem of the Iraqi poet Ahmad Batar, Rifat is like a wheat stalk. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2051.28s)]
*  Even when that wheat stalk is falling to the ground, he is only falling to plant more seeds. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2058.88s)]
*  We are those seeds. And we promise to stand tall and strong and carry his legacy forward. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2065.1200000000003s)]
*  And as Suzan Abu Al Hawa said, Rifat did not die, he multiplied. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2072.6400000000003s)]
*  Thank you so much, Shaima. Jihad, talk about your friendship with Rifat, please. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2080.8s)]
*  Thank you for having us. I met Rifat in 2004. I was 16 or 17 years old then. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2091.04s)]
*  I was in the 10th grade. And I was chosen by my school in Deir el-Balah to attend a [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2104.3199999999997s)]
*  one-year English language program that was organized at Amid East, which is an American [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2118.48s)]
*  non-educational nonprofit that had an office in Gaza City. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2128.64s)]
*  And for a year, I commuted with a number of Palestinian [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2137.36s)]
*  students from Deir el-Balah, from Khan Younes, from Rafah, from the north, from Gaza City, [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2144.24s)]
*  to Amid East's office to attend this one-year program. And I remember [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2152.0s)]
*  this day, walking into the classroom, there was this [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2163.2s)]
*  young teacher with his light beard, with his expo marker, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2171.52s)]
*  welcoming us into the classroom. He had a gentle smile, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2178.64s)]
*  a very polite and loving and caring demeanor. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2189.7599999999998s)]
*  For me personally, as someone who has been going to public school for a few years, [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2196.96s)]
*  that was a change of scenery and a change of culture. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2203.92s)]
*  And from day one, my colleagues and I realized how fortunate we were and how fortunate we are about [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2210.32s)]
*  to become, recognizing the impact Rifa'at will have on us. We did not fully comprehend [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2221.52s)]
*  what kind of role Rifa'at will play in our lives. I wasn't sure about him. He did care about his [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2231.6s)]
*  students, and at the same time, he also had a very positive attitude towards his students. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2242.0s)]
*  He roasted them, sometimes with his mean jokes and with his dark humor. He also wasn't sure about me, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2250.72s)]
*  but we became friends, and one day he honored me by allowing me to add him on MSN messenger, [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2262.3999999999996s)]
*  and it was a big deal for me. I thought I was the coolest kid in that program, to be able to chat, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2274.64s)]
*  to have instant messages with Rifa'at on a daily basis. We learned so much from him. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2285.12s)]
*  When I wrote on Twitter the other day about how Rifa'at used the English language as a tool for [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2294.4s)]
*  liberation and defiance and as a way to challenge Israel's siege on Gaza, that wasn't an exaggeration. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2305.52s)]
*  You have to consider Gaza in 2004, 2005. This is the time when I met Rifa'at, and I got to know him. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2320.24s)]
*  Isolation wasn't just an abstract thing. It was an actual feeling that then would become worse and [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2331.04s)]
*  worse with the imposition of the blockade in 2007. It was a very, very, very, very, very, very, [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2339.12s)]
*  blockade in 2007. To have someone like Rifa'at who would tell you about the giants of literature, [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2347.8399999999997s)]
*  but also who would teach you about Malcolm X and Martin Luther King and the difference [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2361.12s)]
*  between them and introduce you to the civil rights movement and to [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2369.12s)]
*  Desmond Tutu and talk to you about issues and matters that were happening and things that were [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2378.08s)]
*  important beyond the confines of Gaza's blockade. For us, that was a big deal. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2388.08s)]
*  And he blew our minds many, many times with the kind of knowledge he would impart [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2395.6800000000003s)]
*  on us as his students. And Rifa'at saw, and I talked about this and I will keep repeating it, [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2403.2000000000003s)]
*  he saw in English as a language and as something that you embrace as part of your daily life. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2412.0s)]
*  He saw it as a tool of empowerment, especially for young Palestinian students who come from [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2422.56s)]
*  impoverished backgrounds in the Gaza Strip. When people learn and speak English in many parts of [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2432.88s)]
*  the Arab world, they do so as a way of detaching themselves from the larger society. It's part of [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2443.04s)]
*  a conscious or subconscious effort to become westernized in your own country, in your own [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2452.8s)]
*  society, to detach yourself from the people around you, to embrace western brands, to connect [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2461.84s)]
*  to western popular culture. It has a classist dimension, this practice, but for Rifa'at, [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2471.36s)]
*  it was the opposite. He taught English and encouraged people to learn it so that they [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2477.92s)]
*  can break free from the constraints that Israel has imposed on us as victims of its blockade and [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2483.6s)]
*  occupation and redevelopment and impoverishment. English becomes a tool to connect with other [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2491.44s)]
*  struggles, to learn about them, to understand the heroes and the giants and the ideas of these [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2497.84s)]
*  struggles and of these cases for liberation that are taking place around the world. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2507.04s)]
*  So Rifa'at was free. He was free despite that he lived under occupation and despite all the pain [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2515.44s)]
*  that Israel has inflicted on him and his family. And Rifa'at freed us. We were young teenagers and [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2522.08s)]
*  and you know like people who are in in their college age, some followed Rifa'at's path, others [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2531.2799999999997s)]
*  sometimes weren't sure what to do with the knowledge that he gave them. But I can tell you, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2543.3599999999997s)]
*  Rifa'at freed all of us. He freed all of us and he gave us a way to connect with the outside world, [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2548.96s)]
*  to learn more about ourselves and to understand our experience better. Because when you grow up [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2558.64s)]
*  in Gaza under blockade, you grow better. You grow, you know, sometimes it could take you to very dark [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2565.44s)]
*  places in terms of questioning why is this all pain inflicted on us? Is there something wrong with us? [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2573.6800000000003s)]
*  So Rifa'at comes and he tells you about the the Black struggle in America. He tells you about [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2580.4s)]
*  South Africa. He tells you about this issue and for that issue and you begin to understand that [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2586.32s)]
*  no, this is about injustice and this is about again the universal connections that Youssef [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2591.84s)]
*  talks about and Shayma also referred to. So you know there's so much to say about Rifa'at Al-A'raf [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2601.28s)]
*  and there will be plenty of time to honor his memory and I think, you know, Rifa'at again, [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2609.76s)]
*  like Youssef said, he's not someone who we should talk about in the past tense. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2617.6800000000003s)]
*  Rifa'at, however, entrusted me with a huge burden when I reached out to him to contribute to Light [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2623.6000000000004s)]
*  in Gaza, Writings Born of Fire, the book that you can see behind Ali. He told me, [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2630.96s)]
*  and I would like to quote him if I may, he told me, you know, that he's really tired [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2642.0s)]
*  of how unheard Palestinians are. So he wrote, when I was approached to write for this book, [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2652.2400000000002s)]
*  the promise was that it will affect change and that policies, especially in the United States, [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2661.12s)]
*  will be improved. But honestly, will they? Does a single Palestinian life matter? [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2668.0s)]
*  Does it? And then he wrote, it shall pass, I keep hoping. It shall pass, I keep saying. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2675.52s)]
*  Sometimes I mean it, sometimes I don't. And as Gaza keeps gasping for life, we struggle for it to [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2682.96s)]
*  pass. We have no choice but to fight back and to tell her stories for Palestine. But I would like [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2689.52s)]
*  to end with this. Telling the story is a burden on the victim and a burden on the oppressed. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2696.96s)]
*  But us telling our stories as Rifa'at told us isn't enough. There has to be people on the other [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2705.36s)]
*  side of the storytelling who listen and who take action. So listen to Rifa'at, heed his words, [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2715.36s)]
*  let it be a tale, and let it be a big fight for our liberation. Thank you. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2724.8s)]
*  Thank you so much, Jahad. Thank you so much. That was beautiful. Before we go to two more [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2732.1600000000003s)]
*  friends of Rifa'at, we wanted to talk about Rifa'at as first and foremost an educator. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2740.8s)]
*  He loved the classroom. And we have a clip of him doing what he loved to do the most, teaching in a [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2747.28s)]
*  classroom in Gaza. The following clip is a part of a series of lectures that Rifa'at had posted [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2753.36s)]
*  on his YouTube channel. Let's go to that. Personally, every time I teach a course, [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2760.56s)]
*  any course actually, I have one major goal in mind. I claim that I want to change my students' [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2768.56s)]
*  lives, hopefully to the bitter. Because I do believe, and this is for many people, this is [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2777.12s)]
*  literature. What is literature going to change about me or in me or for me or around me? It [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2783.7599999999998s)]
*  doesn't put probably food on table. It doesn't, I don't know, make me rich. Although it does most [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2789.7599999999998s)]
*  of the time if you are a successful writer, especially if you are a novelist. So I say the [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2796.08s)]
*  first thing in my course is that poetry is about making us better human beings. Poetry is about [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2802.4s)]
*  improving the way we look at things, the way we deal with others, the way we deal with life with [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2810.4s)]
*  difficulties, the way we deal with ourselves, the way we treat ourselves, the way we think about things. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2816.08s)]
*  And probably I usually mention this, how poetry is self-expression. And you said this already [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2822.24s)]
*  before. How poetry is self-expression. There's something you feel that the urge to get it out. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2830.64s)]
*  Whether you want to communicate or not, whether you want people to react to your self-expression [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2838.0s)]
*  or not. Poetry literature is an act, a very significant act of self-expression. I don't [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2844.0s)]
*  want to exaggerate, but could be as important as the need to eat sometimes. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2850.96s)]
*  I'm so grateful that we still have his voice. We are now joined by Noor Nemer, [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2860.16s)]
*  a Palestinian translator, student of Rifat, and Ahmed Nihad, also a student of Rifat, Ahmed and [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2867.2799999999997s)]
*  Noor. Thank you so much for being here. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2875.04s)]
*  Ahmed, please go ahead. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2880.7999999999997s)]
*  Hi, everyone. Thank you. I guess nothing, as Jihad said, nothing is enough to say about Dr. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2888.96s)]
*  Rifat. Dr. Ali says everyone who talks about Rifat cannot but in a way talk about himself. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2904.08s)]
*  And yes, Rifat shaped us all and made us the people we are now. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2912.48s)]
*  One thing I don't know, I always ask myself where Dr. Rifat brings and where he gets all this [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2919.36s)]
*  energy and strength to talk and write all the time about Palestine, about Gaza. I have spent most of [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2928.88s)]
*  my days with him as a translator. I have spent most of my days with him as a translator. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2939.36s)]
*  I have spent most of my days with him as a friend and colleague, but actually as his minty [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2946.64s)]
*  all the time. And I shared the details of his life, of his meals, of his jokes, [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2952.08s)]
*  of watching football together, or, I don't know, bullying each other. And [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2959.6s)]
*  the more you get to know him, the more you respect this man. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2967.7599999999998s)]
*  But still, one thing, one question I've never been able to answer is how does Dr. Rifat find [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2977.6s)]
*  all this energy and hope to talk, to write, to put in so much effort and make such an impact? [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=2985.2s)]
*  What I want to say to Omar, to Ahmed Yassin, to Shema, to Sara, to Amal, to Lina, to Omar [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3003.8399999999997s)]
*  is that they should know they have thousands and thousands of friends and siblings [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3012.08s)]
*  in Gaza and around the world. I know nothing, nothing can replace Rifat, a giant who can do [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3020.7200000000003s)]
*  an Excel in 20 tasks at the same time, better than 20 people and more can do one task. I [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3029.44s)]
*  keep saying this. I guess this is one thing that can, I don't know, sum up Dr. Rifat. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3038.2400000000002s)]
*  One of the first memories I have of him, because I knew him since I was like 12, [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3049.2000000000003s)]
*  but one thing, one memory I always have is attending [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3056.88s)]
*  a seminar for his friend, Dr. Mahmoud Harshani in Gaza, and he was there to report the seminar. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3063.52s)]
*  And I was sitting, he was in front of me and I could see his MacBook, I could see him [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3073.6s)]
*  and everything he did. And I couldn't but see how in the same time he's listening to what Dr. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3087.7599999999998s)]
*  Mahmoud is saying, being active and like participating in discussions and at the same [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3096.48s)]
*  time reporting what's happening in the seminar and then at the same time tweeting on his multiple [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3102.48s)]
*  Twitter accounts and the same time following the news and checking and editing texts and texting [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3110.4s)]
*  other people and I don't know, making sure that everybody has a seat and making sure everybody [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3121.2000000000003s)]
*  has their bottle of juice and at the same time again being attentive and like making [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3128.32s)]
*  important points about what's going on. So I know nothing and no one can ever replace him or [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3135.2s)]
*  even all of us together. But I want his sons and daughters and wife and I want them all to know that [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3144.4s)]
*  we are here to try with whatever energy and life we have to continue his journey, his projects [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3156.08s)]
*  in every possible way. And I want to say to us, to his friends, mentees and students [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3162.96s)]
*  that we have a lot to do. Dr. Refat left us until his last moment with many ideas, [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3171.84s)]
*  projects, texts, stories, films and poems to complete. We owe it to him [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3180.2400000000002s)]
*  and to his Palestine that he loves, to continue his path. I have nothing to say [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3188.2400000000002s)]
*  but to testify that Dr. Refat is one of those who suffered in many ways. The more you know him, [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3198.96s)]
*  the more you know Dr. Refat and his life and the details of everything that he went through, [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3206.2400000000002s)]
*  the more you know how much he suffered and how much he had [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3214.2400000000002s)]
*  in his plate to do family-wise, community-wise, university-wise, everywhere. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3221.76s)]
*  And he reached stages of despair and worry just like many of us many times. I'm always amazed [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3231.84s)]
*  at how he could always come back stronger each time with more productivity, with more texts, [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3239.2799999999997s)]
*  with more poetry, with more helping other people and reaching different platforms to talk and write [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3246.0s)]
*  about Palestine. And I know the path is full of these contradictions between hopelessness and hope [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3258.64s)]
*  and I know he went through those contradictions all the time. But as he taught us, as he still [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3266.9599999999996s)]
*  teaches us that we have nothing else, we have no other way but to continue to talk about Palestine, [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3275.52s)]
*  to write about Palestine, about Gaza in every possible way and just like him unapologetically [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3285.8399999999997s)]
*  and as strongly as possible. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3294.3199999999997s)]
*  I saw Abu Umar put his whole heart into every story and article he wrote or edited with his mentees. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3301.52s)]
*  He gave everything he had to his students, to his mentees. I had the privilege to work [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3310.56s)]
*  beside him. I had the privilege at the first place to be coached and taught by him. And then [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3318.48s)]
*  I had the privilege thanks to him to be his co-mentor and to be beside him. I always thought I [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3328.48s)]
*  did a good job being a mentor, taking care of students and helping them in every way possible. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3337.76s)]
*  I always thought I cared. But then I look just next to him and the way he talks to students [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3345.2s)]
*  and mentees and then the conversations we'd have afterwards in his car because he'd never leave me [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3353.7599999999998s)]
*  walk back to my office alone even though my office is like [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3363.12s)]
*  very close. But he'd always take me with his car and we'd talk about the day and about the students. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3367.7599999999998s)]
*  He'd still shout and be angry or be enthusiastic or like he'd always talk about [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3374.3999999999996s)]
*  students and their works and like how amazed he is with the brilliance of them or how disappointed [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3382.7999999999997s)]
*  he is that they lost this chance or this opportunity. And he'd always be like I know [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3389.6s)]
*  this person or this mentee has a lot of potential and I wish they could live up to this potential [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3396.64s)]
*  and do everything they can. He cared and I remember always having this argument with him, [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3404.7200000000003s)]
*  asking him, begging him to not care that much because even me as a student and many of us, [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3410.88s)]
*  we sometimes or most of the time we were afraid a little bit of him because like we know we'd [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3418.48s)]
*  make a doubly space or deal with space before the coma or we'd forget something important or [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3427.92s)]
*  we would for example not know about Malcolm X or about any important activist and he would like [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3434.96s)]
*  be really angry, not because he's angry but more because he cared, more because he wanted us to be [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3445.6s)]
*  the best virgins of ourselves. And as everybody said, as Jihad said and like everybody whenever [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3452.72s)]
*  we talk about Dr. Rifaat, he always believed in us more than we believed in ourselves and he always [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3459.44s)]
*  sow in us the potential we had. Sometimes he implanted this potential, he poured all his [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3468.16s)]
*  heart into making us better people in a way or another. And this thing he said in the clip you [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3474.7999999999997s)]
*  just shared about him having his aim as a teacher to change his students lives, I don't remember a [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3485.04s)]
*  class he gave to me or I gave with him for the past six years without him starting with this. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3493.6s)]
*  It was his true aim and I saw with my own eyes and myself as an example and in hundreds of other [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3503.44s)]
*  people I saw myself and thousands others I learned about how he actually changed our lives [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3510.24s)]
*  for the better and not only as people, not only the way we think but also he changed us [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3517.52s)]
*  in also intangible ways. Lots of us had their first jobs or the first important jobs thanks to him [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3529.2s)]
*  because he always recommended us to people, he always helped us get those jobs and then he always [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3538.08s)]
*  helped us do them the best ways we can. Again, as I said he gave us all his heart and I know that [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3545.68s)]
*  we owe it to him to carry this heart, to carry all this that he taught us, that he still teaches us. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3565.3599999999997s)]
*  To continue his path, to continue writing, talking, resisting the occupation and [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3576.48s)]
*  with, I know again we have lots and lots to do and I know we are all determined to continue this [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3589.44s)]
*  path, to continue all the unfinished projects, all the unfinished texts and ideas that he gave us [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3597.52s)]
*  with all the energy and all the life we have, all the energy and all the life he gives us [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3606.24s)]
*  forever. The son of Shadiyyah, Dr. Rifa'at, Rafiq Al-Arair, in our hearts, voices, words and [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3614.56s)]
*  resistance, the words that we pass down. Thank you. Thank you so much Ahmed. Thank you. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3623.8399999999997s)]
*  Hi everyone. Thank you all for sharing your thoughts and memories of Dr. Rifa'at [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3636.64s)]
*  and thank you Ali and Noura and everybody for arranging this beautiful meaningful live stream. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3642.7999999999997s)]
*  I had the privilege of being Dr. Rafa'at's student in five courses, one of which is a literary [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3649.3599999999997s)]
*  translation course. He taught me literary translation in the most beautiful way I can ask for [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3655.52s)]
*  and he believed in me. He praised the first poem I've ever translated and encouraged me to translate [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3662.16s)]
*  more and more and now I am a translator thanks to him. Dr. Rifa'at has always put our interests first. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3669.6s)]
*  I remember working on a research paper last summer with my friends Ali and Dunya and we used to [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3678.4s)]
*  frequently go to his office and ask him plenty of questions and despite his busy schedule, [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3686.0s)]
*  he would pause his work to listen to our questions and he even rewarded us with bonus marks for doing [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3692.56s)]
*  so and I guess we all know how rare and precious his bonus marks are and in that same summer, [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3699.84s)]
*  my friends and I were planning to create a fan page to gather all the memes and the stickers we [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3709.2799999999997s)]
*  made or he made on him, on Shakespeare, on us but we never did that page. I think when this war ends, [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3716.16s)]
*  we will create it as a small tribute to the joy and laughter he brought into our lives. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3725.6s)]
*  Now, many students speak of how he pushed us to grow and to step out of our comfort zones [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3732.4s)]
*  but what astonished me was his gentleness in doing so. I mean, I remember in my early college days, [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3740.8s)]
*  I was shy and sensitive so when I get distracted in the class, he would seamlessly incorporate [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3749.12s)]
*  my name into examples to bring me back into focus and to keep me interacting. It was a subtle, [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3757.12s)]
*  impactful way of encouraging me to engage in the lecture. Dr. Rifat has always felt a responsibility [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3764.16s)]
*  for every person he knew. During the war, he posted in our poetry course group to check on us [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3773.3599999999997s)]
*  to check on us and he told us that he feels embarrassed for not knowing how to help us [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3782.0s)]
*  while he himself was facing the same hard situation and he also offered phone balance [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3788.64s)]
*  to anyone in need. As most of Dr. Rifat's students, I have many, many memories with him but [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3795.2799999999997s)]
*  the one I will always remember him through is not the most significant one but the latest one. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3805.04s)]
*  Just one week before his martyrdom, I sent him my translation of his poem named The Trench to ask [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3812.08s)]
*  him if the translation is good enough to be shared. He read it and he told me it's excellent and I was [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3820.24s)]
*  so happy because Dr. Rifat is the kind of person who always encourages you, yes, but he doesn't [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3827.7599999999998s)]
*  praise your work that easily and he told me to post it on Twitter so he can repost it and it was [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3834.48s)]
*  the first time Dr. Rifat shares on his personal account something I translated and because I've [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3841.2s)]
*  always looked up to him, it really meant so much to me and finally I want to say that [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3847.9199999999996s)]
*  meeting Dr. Rifat was a turning point in my life but his assassination, as painful as it is, [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3855.52s)]
*  marks an even greater turning point. He was a blessing I'll forever cherish and I believe his [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3862.8799999999997s)]
*  legacy will continue to inspire us all, always and forever. Thank you. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3870.24s)]
*  Thank you so much Noor, that was beautiful. We're going to bring on some more friends, [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3878.3199999999997s)]
*  colleagues and students of Rifat's in just a minute but some students were not able to join [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3885.9199999999996s)]
*  because as I mentioned at the beginning, the unreliable connection in Gaza. Here's a clip [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3891.8399999999997s)]
*  that was sent to us by Iman Al-Hajali, she's a journalist and translator based in Gaza. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3897.44s)]
*  Israel has killed Dr. Rifat the earlier year but he's still alive within us. Hi everyone, [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3905.6s)]
*  this is Iman Al-Hajali, a Gaza based journalist, translator and writer. Dr. Rifat was my professor [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3912.2400000000002s)]
*  at the Islamic University of Gaza, yet he was more than that, he was like a father for everyone he [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3919.44s)]
*  taught. I still remember our days at the university when he taught us many courses, [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3926.16s)]
*  indeed these courses are one of the most gorgeous courses that affected and shaped my personality. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3932.48s)]
*  One of these courses is the world literature, I still remember how much he loved literature and [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3939.44s)]
*  how was that like a part of his personality and that's greatly reflected upon his work. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3945.68s)]
*  And that's a great amount of information that he gave us, indeed I love literature due to the way [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3953.44s)]
*  he explained it for us. Now the English department has a great loss, not only the English department [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3963.7599999999998s)]
*  but all of Gaza, all of Palestine lost a great literature man and we will never ever find such [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3972.24s)]
*  a great person like him. He taught me poetry and now I'm writing great poems because of him [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3979.84s)]
*  and I wish that he's still alive to show him these poems. He taught us Shakespeare and I still [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3989.1200000000003s)]
*  remember how much he loved that great play writer, to the extent that whenever we were singing him [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=3996.8s)]
*  we were talking between each other that Shakespeare has come. I still remember [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4003.84s)]
*  one of his lectures when he acted in front of us one of Shakespeare's Hamlet's soliloquies [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4010.88s)]
*  and he told us that this part is one of his favorite parts about how great the creation [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4017.92s)]
*  of the human is and I want to say this for you that how great you wear it. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4024.6400000000003s)]
*  What a piece of what I got I'm speechless, I'm speechless indeed [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4034.32s)]
*  but I want to say that what a piece of work Dr. Rifa'at Al-A'ri is how noble in reason, [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4042.88s)]
*  how infinite in faculty, [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4051.04s)]
*  in form, in moving, how express and admirable, in action, how like an angel. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4056.7200000000003s)]
*  I still remember your sessions when you coached me about creative writing and how you were telling [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4063.92s)]
*  us all the time to fight with our pens, to use our words even if they are the smallest thing that [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4070.48s)]
*  we can do to defend the Palestinian cause, to reveal the harsh reality about the cruel [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4078.2400000000002s)]
*  actions that are taken against us because of Israel and you are now killed because of that. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4086.0s)]
*  Because you were not fearful, because you are not fearful of defending the Palestinian cause, [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4093.84s)]
*  you were not fearful of revealing the barbaric actions committed by Israel against us. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4099.52s)]
*  But you are not killed, you are still alive within us and we will take your fat steps [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4106.08s)]
*  to defend the Palestinian cause as you told us in your poem, [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4112.08s)]
*  I promise you, we will live to tell your story and we will write more and more. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4117.12s)]
*  Israel now tries to kill the intellectuals and educated people like Dr. Rifa'at Al-A'ri. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4127.52s)]
*  They try to rip the tree of knowledge from its foundations but they will not let us down. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4134.400000000001s)]
*  We will resist, we will write more and more, we will write volumes, we will write books to [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4142.32s)]
*  defend the Palestinian cause and to reveal the harsh reality that we are suffering from [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4149.12s)]
*  because of the cruel so-called Israel and its brutal actions against us. Thank you. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4156.24s)]
*  That's beautiful from Iman. Thank you so much, Iman. We're now joined by Malek Zakout, [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4164.96s)]
*  writer and translator and also Khaled El-Hissi, journalist from Jabalia in the Gaza Strip. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4171.92s)]
*  Malek, let's start with you. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4180.24s)]
*  Hi, can you hear me? [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4184.88s)]
*  Yes, yes we can. Thank you. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4186.0s)]
*  All right, thank you for having me. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4189.5199999999995s)]
*  But before we go, just a quick comment on what Ahmad said about how he thought he did well [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4191.12s)]
*  with the Mentees and then he looked at Dr. Rifa'at and then he no longer felt he did well compared [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4197.5199999999995s)]
*  to Dr. Rifa'at. Ahmad, I know this won't make you feel good, students used to call you the other [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4202.4s)]
*  Rifa'at. Literally, they used to call you the other Rifa'at and I know this because I was the [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4208.24s)]
*  project coordinator at which Dr. Rifa'at and Ahmad were the ones who were called the other Rifa'at. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4213.36s)]
*  Which Dr. Rifa'at and Ahmad were mentors. Thanks to Dr. Rifa'at, he believed in me when I myself [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4219.28s)]
*  did not believe in myself. He called me one day and he was like, Malek, there is this opportunity, [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4225.84s)]
*  Ahmad, I'm so sorry, I just want you to be happy. He was like, Malek, there is this opportunity [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4232.88s)]
*  and I think you're a perfect fit and I was like, what was it? And he said, it's a project or [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4239.5199999999995s)]
*  coordination position. I was like, no way I'm going and he was like, yes, [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4245.28s)]
*  way you're going and I was like, I'm not going to be accepted and he was like, [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4250.08s)]
*  no, you're going to go to the interview and I think it's not your call. Just do what you [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4255.12s)]
*  have to do and then the next day I was accepted. I got my acceptance message. So yeah, [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4261.44s)]
*  without going longer, I had the honor to. Can I comment? [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4270.16s)]
*  Of course. I took one course with Mr. Ahmad. We were calling him the young Rifa'at. We were [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4276.32s)]
*  always calling him the young Rifa'at because he always used to be like Dr. Rifa'at. So yeah, [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4284.5599999999995s)]
*  Malek is right. Yes. Okay, so I'm going to have the honor of reading I Am You by Dr. Rifa'at Lala'il. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4290.4s)]
*  I hope my recitation does it justice. Two steps. One, two. Look in the mirror. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4298.88s)]
*  The horror, the horror. The butt of your M16 on my cheekbone, the yellow patch it left, [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4308.32s)]
*  the bullet shaped scar expanding like a swastika. Snagging across my face, the heartache flowing out [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4314.4800000000005s)]
*  of my eyes, dripping out of my nostrils, piercing my ears, flooding the place like it did to you. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4321.52s)]
*  70 years ago or so. I am just you. I'm your past haunting your present and your future. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4328.88s)]
*  I strive like you did. I fight like you did. I resist like you resisted and for a moment I [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4337.28s)]
*  take your tenacity as a model. Were you not holding the barrel of the gun between my bleeding eyes? [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4344.16s)]
*  One, two. The very same gun, the very same bullet that had killed your mom and killed your dad is [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4351.04s)]
*  being used against me by you. Mark this bullet and mark in your gun. If you sniff it, it has your [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4359.12s)]
*  and my blood. It has my present and your past. It has my present. It has your future. That's why [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4368.799999999999s)]
*  we are twins. Same life track, same weapon, same suffering, same facial expressions drawn on the [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4377.92s)]
*  face of the killer, same everything except that in your case the victim has evolved backward into a [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4385.76s)]
*  victimizer. I tell you, I am you, except that I'm not the you of now. I do not hate you. I want to [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4393.6s)]
*  help you stop hating and killing me. I tell you, the noise of your machine gun renders you deaf. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4403.36s)]
*  The smell of the powder beats that of my blood. The sparks disfigure my facial expressions. Would [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4409.759999999999s)]
*  you stop shooting for a moment? Would you? All you have to do is close your eyes, seeing these days [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4416.24s)]
*  lines our hearts. Close your eyes tightly so that you can see in your mind's eye. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4424.320000000001s)]
*  Then look into the mirror. One, two, I am you. I'm your past and killing me, you kill you. Thank you. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4433.200000000001s)]
*  Oh Malik, that was extraordinary. Thank you so much. Khaled, what can you say? [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4445.68s)]
*  I have a lot of things to say. As Ahmed said, no one can sum up Dr. Rifaat. No one can describe [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4461.4400000000005s)]
*  the feeling he lived or being, what is the feeling of being a student with Dr. Rifaat. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4471.2s)]
*  But I'm very proud to be one of Dr. Rifaat's students. I was and still a student. Dr. Rifaat [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4479.5199999999995s)]
*  taught me. He taught me a lot of things. In classes he did not only teach me poetry, [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4488.48s)]
*  drama or Shakespeare courses, but he also taught me academic writing, creative writing, grammar, [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4495.4400000000005s)]
*  translation, although he wasn't the doctor for me for these things. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4502.88s)]
*  In his classes he also taught me history, culture, geography. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4509.76s)]
*  Sometimes he taught me how to draw even if my drawing was bad. He made me love the poetry. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4513.76s)]
*  And maybe most importantly, he made me love and know how to create memes. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4521.84s)]
*  I never saw a doctor use memes as a method of teaching. He loved memes. He loved to meme [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4527.5199999999995s)]
*  everything. He made us love them too. Sometimes we were memeing him and he would love that also. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4534.32s)]
*  I think all of his students know that. We also used his photos as stickers on WhatsApp [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4541.84s)]
*  and he never said anything about that, but he was also happy. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4548.88s)]
*  He always encouraged us, encouraged me, encouraged other students to be creative, [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4556.4800000000005s)]
*  think outside the box, to get out of our comfort zone. As Noor said, he would tell us to come to [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4561.52s)]
*  the class without researching about the next poem. This was in the poetry course. I still remember [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4570.0s)]
*  the poetry course. I still remember this vividly. We would read the poem and discover it in the [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4575.52s)]
*  class. He wanted us to be creative. He didn't want us to prepare and like to search about [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4581.52s)]
*  everything, then like come and say everything like, you know, no, he wanted us to think, [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4587.92s)]
*  to be creative. I think that is his goal. He knew it was difficult for him to do so. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4592.160000000001s)]
*  And he would be mad at us sometimes. He would be mad at us very, very many times, because it was [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4600.24s)]
*  not easy for us to understand the whole poem without any previous research. But at the end, [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4608.08s)]
*  when someone answers or someone's like, know the answer of this question, he was like, he would be [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4614.88s)]
*  very, very happy. And he never gave up shaping our creativity. And to those who were creative, [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4621.2s)]
*  those students who were like thinking outside the box, he would reward them with a bonus mark. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4633.12s)]
*  And only Dr. Rifat's students know how much it is hard to get a bonus mark from him. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4639.68s)]
*  I would never forget his facial expressions when he gave me one. This is one of my best memories. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4645.12s)]
*  Like he was introducing us to Shakespeare's sonnet 18, Shall I Compare Thee to a Summer's Day, [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4652.56s)]
*  and like he admired Shakespeare. He always was talking about Shakespeare, 24 hours. And before [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4658.24s)]
*  this sonnet, we took a sonnet for Sir Thomas Wyatt, who was so list to hunt. I think it was called [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4666.56s)]
*  So he showed us in this sonnet about Thomas Wyatt, how he used the meter, this poet, [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4674.320000000001s)]
*  how he used the meter, the iambic meter to emphasize himself by stressing the pronoun I. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4680.320000000001s)]
*  And I applied the same thing when he was introducing us to sonnet 18, [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4685.68s)]
*  how Shakespeare unstressed the thee, the thee there. And then he stressed it at the end of the poem [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4692.160000000001s)]
*  to indicate to the addressee that with my words, with my poetry, [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4700.0s)]
*  you will always be like strong and you will live forever. And I raised my hand and I answered [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4706.72s)]
*  like this question. And Dr. Rifat was like, wow, wow, excellent. One bonus mark for you. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4712.0s)]
*  One bonus mark. I still remember this vividly. I still remember how he said it. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4720.72s)]
*  And I wasn't happy because of the extra mark. I was happy because I could make him feel happy. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4727.44s)]
*  I think students told me that it was impossible, like the doctor would praise you. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4733.839999999999s)]
*  This incident making Dr. Rifat proud and happy encouraged me and my friends to always come [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4741.2s)]
*  prepared to the class and try to think creatively and out of the blue. And I was so happy. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4748.639999999999s)]
*  I have realized there is no time to subject to your criticism Curt. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4755.12s)]
*  Dr. echo told me something, [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4761.5199999999995s)]
*  also said what led him to become like a rock. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4765.12s)]
*  And it was like he wanted to change this problem. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4769.12s)]
*  To be like, you need chance. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4773.68s)]
*  I get what you mean. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4775.44s)]
*  I want to credits you for your work and push you, [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4776.72s)]
*  and be like so kind and so nice to each other and [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4781.5199999999995s)]
*  afraid of anything. He is teaching me that words are very powerful or immortal. Dr. Rifat's [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4784.3s)]
*  voice reached and encouraged millions of people, although he was in Gaza. He is teaching me [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4790.9800000000005s)]
*  how to be kind, generous, and most importantly, how to offer help to others. Even in these [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4796.34s)]
*  times I need help, to be a giver always, more than a taker. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4803.02s)]
*  The last thing I would like to say, the last remark, if Israel killed Rifat, by this action [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4809.78s)]
*  it had created millions of Rifats. Each one of his friends is a Rifat. Each one of his [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4816.219999999999s)]
*  students is a Rifat. And we will honor him by continuing his mission, by defending Palestine, [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4822.54s)]
*  and it's just case. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4830.259999999999s)]
*  Khaled, Hissi, thank you so much. That was gorgeous. And Malik, again, thank you so much [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4832.259999999999s)]
*  for reading that poem. Before we go to some more friends and students, Rifat loves stories. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4839.72s)]
*  And we wanted to show a clip of Rifat giving a TEDx talk in Shujaiyah, his neighborhood, [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4851.56s)]
*  and talking about how he was taught by his mother and grandmother about the power of [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4858.72s)]
*  storytelling. Let's go to that. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4864.320000000001s)]
*  Now, Edward Said warns of this. If we stop caring about stories, if we stop telling [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4867.96s)]
*  our stories, if we stop listening to our parents, we create space, we create vacuum for others [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4872.7s)]
*  to occupy this virtual space in our past, in our heart. Edward Said says, history is [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4881.64s)]
*  made by men and women. And I love the fact that he refers to this, the fact that this [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4888.44s)]
*  by women and men, not leaders, not politicians, not the elite, because the history, the oral [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4894.92s)]
*  history for us Palestinians belongs to you, to me, to our mom, to our dad, to our grandparents, [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4901.04s)]
*  to your parents and to your grandparents, because the oral history should always belong [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4907.88s)]
*  to the people, should shape politics, not the other way around. History is made by men [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4913.76s)]
*  and women, just as it can also be unmade and unwritten in case we just leave it and [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4919.64s)]
*  keep silent. And this also takes me to an amazing story of a native Canadian. When the [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4927.4800000000005s)]
*  colonizers took over North America and they wanted to divide the land among themselves, [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4934.4800000000005s)]
*  one of the eldest approached them. He asked, what are you doing? He said, we own the land, [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4942.360000000001s)]
*  we are dividing the land among ourselves. He said, if this is your land, tell me your [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4948.12s)]
*  stories. If this is indeed your land, tell me your stories. And of course the answer [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4955.12s)]
*  is silence, because they had no stories and they don't own the land. And it also takes [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4967.36s)]
*  me to Africa and I love how talking about oral history and storytelling connects indigenous [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4975.08s)]
*  native people from all over the world. Cheney Wachabe teaches us something. This is a lesson [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4981.88s)]
*  for us all. If the lions do not have their own historians, the history of the hunt will [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4989.4s)]
*  always glorify the hunters, will always glorify the occupier, will always glorify the colonizer [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=4997.4s)]
*  rather than the colonized, the oppressed, the indigenous, the rightful people of the [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5003.52s)]
*  land. And believe me, people out there are looking forward to our stories. They want [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5008.76s)]
*  our stories, they seek our stories. And this is the very amazing success story of Gaza [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5016.88s)]
*  Rights Back, which is a book. Gaza Rights Back is a book of 23 stories, and it is a [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5023.320000000001s)]
*  book written in English by young Palestinian men and women between the age of 17 and 25. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5033.52s)]
*  13 of the 15 writers are females. 13 of the 15 writers are women, are young women. And [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5043.88s)]
*  this again takes me back to the fact that my mom made me, my mom made me the man I am [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5056.120000000001s)]
*  because of her stories. And my grandmother made me love my country, my homeland. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5061.64s)]
*  I encourage everyone who's listening or watching right now to go over to Rafa'at's YouTube [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5072.280000000001s)]
*  channel and watch that as well as some of his lectures. I mean, the TED talk is extraordinary [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5079.84s)]
*  and I learn something new every time I watch it, which in the last few days has been many [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5087.84s)]
*  times. We are going to go to one more clip from Zainab Bashir from Gaza. She's a translator, [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5096.0s)]
*  storyteller and a student of Rafa'at. Let's go to that clip. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5104.08s)]
*  Everyone, I'm Zainab, a student of Dr. Rafa'at in the Arab Emirates, and one thing I learned [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5109.08s)]
*  in the Arab Emirates, and I hear this in peace, is that we should never stop writing. Our [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5116.84s)]
*  words matter, our voices matter. There is never right and wrong in writing and in translating. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5121.2s)]
*  He always made us brave. He made us believe in ourselves, believe in our translations, [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5130.0s)]
*  believe in our writings. He told us to never stop translating and writing, because it's [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5134.8s)]
*  powerful, we need it. We have to publish it, we have to share it, we have to show the words, [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5139.76s)]
*  our voices and our words. That made us brave, that made us believe more that our voices [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5145.56s)]
*  matter, made us believe more in our translations, in our words. And he did it, encouraged us, [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5152.72s)]
*  every one of us, whenever we go and ask him to look at our translations and our writings, [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5159.52s)]
*  he would always encourage us to publish them, he would always show us enthusiasm and gets [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5163.96s)]
*  excited and gets super out of us. One thing I will never forget that happened with him [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5170.28s)]
*  was last semester when we were studying Shakespeare's course, we were studying Hamlet's play, and [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5179.5599999999995s)]
*  he was explaining the last line of Hamlet when Hamlet dies, he says, the rest is silence. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5186.0s)]
*  Dr. Rafa'at wrote that on the board, and he wrote, tell my story, because I'm not [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5193.0s)]
*  sure, Hamlet told his husband to tell his story, so Dr. Rafa'at told us the best thing [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5200.36s)]
*  that someone can get after his death, it's someone who tells his story and raises his [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5208.4s)]
*  voice, and that stuck in my mind, and when I heard the news of his assassination, I remembered [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5213.679999999999s)]
*  that thing he said, and I said that we should all promise ourselves to amplify his voice [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5223.08s)]
*  and to tell his story, and the rest must not be silenced, the rest should not be silenced, [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5229.28s)]
*  like Hamlet said. May he rest in power, we will all be his voice, and I hope we never [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5234.76s)]
*  fail him. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5242.92s)]
*  That's Zainab Bashir from Gaza, we'll also play a clip from Younes Al-Halaq, a former [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5244.72s)]
*  student of Rifat and also a writer in Gaza, let's go to that. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5251.92s)]
*  Hello, this is Younes Al-Halaq from Gaza Strip, and I'm also one of the students of the English [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5258.92s)]
*  Department at the Islamic University of Gaza. Dr. Rafa'at Al-Arair taught us some courses, [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5268.0s)]
*  and Dr. Rafa'at when he was teaching us, he wasn't only teaching us the course and he [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5276.0s)]
*  leave the class, no, no, but Dr. Rafa'at was like a friend, he was pushing us to do something [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5283.0s)]
*  creative, to do something like to speak, to do, to write back, and to get your voice out, [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5288.24s)]
*  this is what he wanted us to do always, okay, so this is why we believe as his students [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5294.6s)]
*  that he was the best doctor, the perfect doctor that we could ever have, so all of [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5301.2s)]
*  his words, all of his advices, inscribed in our hearts before our minds, okay. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5308.2s)]
*  The last time I contacted with him, he was pushing me to write in the world, and this [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5316.12s)]
*  is why I published my story, my article on the electronic intifada, and he was always [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5319.92s)]
*  pushing us, he was always telling us that you have something to do, you have something [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5326.12s)]
*  to write, you have something to speak about, because you live in Gaza, and Gaza has a [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5330.44s)]
*  lot of stories that are hidden, okay, and the world approved wants to know such stories, [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5336.36s)]
*  right, actually we love Dr. Rafa'at Al-Arair, we loved him so much because he was like dealing [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5345.36s)]
*  with our problems, okay, he was like a friend, so that's why we cried when we saw the video [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5352.04s)]
*  that he was crying, yeah, he was crying in the last video he picked in his sister's [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5359.24s)]
*  house, so may Allah bless his soul. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5368.44s)]
*  That's Younes Al-Halaq, a student of Rafa'at's, and both Younes and Zainab, the video before [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5375.44s)]
*  you could hear the Israeli warplane in the background, and then if you listen really [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5386.639999999999s)]
*  closely you could also hear the drones in the background of Younes' video, just unbearable, [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5393.639999999999s)]
*  and we're going to do, we have a voice message from Khalil Abushamala, and then we'll bring [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5400.639999999999s)]
*  some of our guests back on, let's go to that. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5409.639999999999s)]
*  I was shocked when I saw that Rafa'at has been killed by the Israel bombing last week. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5412.84s)]
*  Rafa'at was one of the most distinguished teachers at the English department at the [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5419.84s)]
*  Islamic University, and he was one of the most prominent academics in Gaza who was involved [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5427.84s)]
*  in the political issues and the daily life of his society. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5434.84s)]
*  Rafa'at was the founder of We Are Not Numbers, which is very meaningful, which conveys a [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5440.04s)]
*  message to the world everywhere that Palestinians in Gaza are not numbers in statistics. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5450.04s)]
*  They represent stories, ambitions, and dreams, and they should live like the other people [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5459.24s)]
*  all over the world. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5470.24s)]
*  I believe that we lost Rafa'at and we lost one of the very distinguished, respectful, [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5473.24s)]
*  and prominent figures in Gaza. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5483.24s)]
*  That's a voice message from Khalil Abushamala. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5489.24s)]
*  Khalil is a veteran human rights activist and a contributor to the electronic intifada, [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5492.24s)]
*  and we really appreciate him and the work that he does. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5500.24s)]
*  Khalid, I wanted to bring you back on. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5505.24s)]
*  You have two messages that you wanted to bring from two of Rafa'at's students. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5509.24s)]
*  Khalid Al-Karshalli is one of Dr. Rafa'at's students. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5517.44s)]
*  He is saying he couldn't record any video or come to this live session because he doesn't [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5526.44s)]
*  have any internet connection. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5535.44s)]
*  He barely sent the message and until now I can't communicate with him. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5536.44s)]
*  He is saying, I took with Dr. Rafa'at two courses, poetry and Shakespeare. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5541.44s)]
*  But that is not all that I have learned from him. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5546.639999999999s)]
*  Dr. Rafa'at was more than a teacher for me. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5549.639999999999s)]
*  Despite the great knowledge that I took from him, he taught me that my language and words [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5552.639999999999s)]
*  can be used in many other ways. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5557.639999999999s)]
*  I was never an early bird at university. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5559.639999999999s)]
*  I have never attended any lecture of any course that was scheduled at eight in the morning. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5562.639999999999s)]
*  Yes, he is right. I know that. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5569.639999999999s)]
*  But after attending one lecture for Dr. Rafa'at, I made sure to not miss any lecture of his, [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5571.84s)]
*  although it was also at eight in the morning. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5577.84s)]
*  I would even make sure to come to the lectures very early, to sit close to him and to hear him clearly. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5580.84s)]
*  He taught my friends Mahmoud and Khalid creative writing at We Are Not Numbers. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5589.84s)]
*  I tried to be part of it just to be able to learn from him. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5594.84s)]
*  But unfortunately, before even giving us any lecture, he was killed by the Israeli occupation. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5599.04s)]
*  He was my role model in defending the Palestinian cause. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5605.04s)]
*  I remember when I looked at his Facebook account and saw that he had several interviews with several news agencies. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5609.04s)]
*  I was impressed that my doctor is not only an educator, but he is also a fighter. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5616.04s)]
*  He fought for Palestine and wrote many stories and books with Palestine. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5622.04s)]
*  I have always wanted to be like him, to be a writer, a poet, a journalist and to defend my case. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5626.24s)]
*  He was and is my inspiration. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5633.24s)]
*  Dear Dr. Rafa'at, you are not dead. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5637.24s)]
*  You are still alive in the heart of every student you taught. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5640.24s)]
*  I will never forget you or your influence on me. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5643.24s)]
*  I promise that I will continue learning, writing and defending Palestine till I see you again in Shia'a Allah in heaven. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5646.24s)]
*  The second message is from Aliya Amadi. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5656.24s)]
*  She is one of Dr. Rafa'at's best students. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5660.24s)]
*  She is 20 years old. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5666.24s)]
*  She is a senior student, was a senior student. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5669.24s)]
*  She sent me this message. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5672.24s)]
*  I have known Dr. Rafa'at for only two years. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5674.24s)]
*  I was then a super-passionate and super-scared for composing or writing simply. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5677.24s)]
*  Because I was aware that 18 or 19 years of life isn't that much experience. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5684.44s)]
*  I was just a beginner. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5690.44s)]
*  But CUSP, which is a culture for sustainable and inclusive peace, a program held in the IUG, [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5692.44s)]
*  was an aperture to the worlds I discovered in myself, my passions too. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5700.44s)]
*  There I have known Dr. Rafa'at a little bit closely. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5707.44s)]
*  He was so generous, so passionate and so phenomenal. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5711.639999999999s)]
*  The 19th of May, 2022 was one of the happiest days in my life. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5715.639999999999s)]
*  Dr. Rafa'at told us stories about his younger self, about his old friend. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5721.639999999999s)]
*  He always treated us like friends. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5727.639999999999s)]
*  We read from Gaza writes back, played pun and tended, told jokes. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5729.639999999999s)]
*  He brought us delicious food and fruits. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5734.639999999999s)]
*  I was finally feeling home and I showed him a literary piece I translated. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5737.84s)]
*  My soul soared to the highest highs once he said that I should be proud of myself for it. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5743.84s)]
*  I owe it all to him and although our acquaintance lasted for only two years, [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5750.84s)]
*  my entire university experience, my entire educational journey was rewarding because of him. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5758.84s)]
*  He bequeathed a very fine literary legacy for minds to feast, [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5766.04s)]
*  and that shall be my companion till my death. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5771.04s)]
*  I vow to pass it on, to be one of the voices, to tell his story, [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5775.04s)]
*  to make it a tale that brings hope for generations to come until Israel is no more and beyond. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5780.04s)]
*  That's his earnest. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5789.04s)]
*  Khaled, thank you so much. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5791.04s)]
*  And please thank those two students on our behalf for joining us. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5793.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5801.24s)]
*  Yousef, you also wanted to say a few words. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5803.24s)]
*  Yes, so I'm working on an article and I asked Rafa'at to send me a quote [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5809.24s)]
*  and he sent me a quote on Sunday. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5815.24s)]
*  I asked him to describe the amount of destruction he has seen [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5819.44s)]
*  after a humanitarian pose took place in Gaza [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5824.44s)]
*  and he was able to walk the streets of Western Gaza City. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5830.44s)]
*  And he said, [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5837.44s)]
*  I strolled through the Western areas of Gaza City [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5839.639999999999s)]
*  and witnessed a level of destruction reminiscent of World War II. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5843.639999999999s)]
*  The extent of quantum devastation is beyond words. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5848.639999999999s)]
*  It feels as though tanks played a deliberate and methodical game of destruction, [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5852.639999999999s)]
*  targeting homes, buildings, businesses, infrastructure, schools, mosques, trees, power lines and poles. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5859.639999999999s)]
*  The way Israel is ravaging Gaza suggests repercussions [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5868.84s)]
*  that will shape life for generations to come. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5873.84s)]
*  These were Rafa'at's words. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5878.84s)]
*  When is that article coming out? [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5884.84s)]
*  Hopefully this week. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5887.84s)]
*  Okay, all right. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5889.84s)]
*  We'll be sure to disseminate that far and wide. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5891.84s)]
*  Thank you, Yousef. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5895.84s)]
*  John, I know that you know Shadjaia. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5898.04s)]
*  You've been able to give us a sense of the powerful and ferocious resistance, [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5904.04s)]
*  especially coming from Shadjaia. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5917.04s)]
*  Rafa'at was a son of Shadjaia, as many have said on this program. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5920.04s)]
*  Can you give us a sense of how Shadjaia also plays a part in the story of Rafa'at [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5926.24s)]
*  and why it's such a significant place? [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5936.24s)]
*  Yeah, I'm listening to this incredible program. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5942.24s)]
*  I'm so honored to be a part of it. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5945.24s)]
*  And I do have a little nagging feeling that Rafa'at would be saying, [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5947.24s)]
*  and he's going to tell us about the resistance news, about what's happening. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5953.44s)]
*  So I just want to just say a little bit, based on Rafa'at's words, [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5957.44s)]
*  what he said about Shadjaia, which means brave and courageous. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5962.44s)]
*  And he said, Shadjaia is adjacent to the eastern edge of Gaza [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5967.44s)]
*  and this means that there's usually a lot of friction. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5971.44s)]
*  There's a lot of Israeli incursions and a lot of resistance. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5974.44s)]
*  And Shadjaia, because of the name, the symbolic name, the iconic name, [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5977.44s)]
*  we grew up with this pride, with this pride because we are from Shadjaia. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5981.639999999999s)]
*  When a war starts, Israel shells Shadjaia heavily, [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5986.639999999999s)]
*  and this is what they did in 2014. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5989.639999999999s)]
*  Thousands of shells were dropped on houses in Shadjaia [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5991.639999999999s)]
*  and people were trying to hide. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5994.639999999999s)]
*  And I remember people from outside Palestine saying, [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5996.639999999999s)]
*  why didn't you evacuate? [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=5998.639999999999s)]
*  Where? Where should we go? [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6001.639999999999s)]
*  Gaza is tiny. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6003.639999999999s)]
*  And sometimes I take the time to explain to people what a house means. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6005.639999999999s)]
*  Where I live, my house in Shadjaia actually was my grandparents' house. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6008.84s)]
*  And my grandfather had four boys and one was killed in prison [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6013.84s)]
*  and then the land was divided among the three that remained. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6017.84s)]
*  There is a first floor and a second floor and then we build another floor. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6021.84s)]
*  And then my two younger brothers, they got married [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6028.84s)]
*  and they built on top of it and so on. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6031.84s)]
*  So when we talk about a house, [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6033.84s)]
*  we talk about 70 people living in this structure. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6036.04s)]
*  You have all your money, all your papers, all your certificates, [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6039.04s)]
*  all your memories, all your photo albums, even your cradle. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6042.04s)]
*  And this is the cradle where you were born. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6046.04s)]
*  It keeps moving from one person to another [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6049.04s)]
*  and then it's all gone in just one click of a button. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6052.04s)]
*  Rafat's whole life in Shadjaia was defined by resistance. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6059.04s)]
*  Shadjaia was where the first intifada, [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6063.24s)]
*  before it began, the spark was lit in Shadjaia [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6067.24s)]
*  when revolutionaries broke out of prison in 1987 [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6071.24s)]
*  and stayed in Shadjaia and fought the Israelis. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6076.24s)]
*  A few weeks later in Jabalia, the first intifada would begin [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6082.24s)]
*  and people all over the world had Palestine on their tongues [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6087.24s)]
*  because of the spark that Shadjaia lit. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6092.44s)]
*  And that's the same in 2014, the 2014 war. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6097.44s)]
*  Shadjaia was famous for its resistance, [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6102.44s)]
*  its fierce resistance in that war as well. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6104.44s)]
*  And in one of Rafat's last tweets, he said, he wrote, [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6110.44s)]
*  I wish I were a freedom fighter [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6115.44s)]
*  so I would die fighting back against these genocidal maniacs [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6118.839999999999s)]
*  invading my neighborhood. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6123.04s)]
*  I just wanted to say to Rafat that you were and you are. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6126.12s)]
*  Thank you, John. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6135.719999999999s)]
*  And Nora, may I just add to that beautiful reading [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6137.679999999999s)]
*  from John that of course we all know how proud Rafat was [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6142.68s)]
*  of Shadjaia and being from Shadjaia. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6147.68s)]
*  And I have to tell you that he called Chicago [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6150.68s)]
*  the Shadjaia of America. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6154.08s)]
*  That was the highest praise he could give us. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6156.08s)]
*  And I don't know if some of our friends [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6159.08s)]
*  are going to be offended by this, [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6162.08s)]
*  but he thought New York was the place to be. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6164.68s)]
*  He thought New York was the high as a tune of America. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6170.08s)]
*  Is there a Jubilee in the United States? [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6179.68s)]
*  Well, he explained to me, of course, [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6184.38s)]
*  I'd only had the pleasure of visiting Gaza once, [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6189.4800000000005s)]
*  but he explained to me the fierce rivalry [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6192.64s)]
*  between Shadjaia and high as they tune. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6196.88s)]
*  And so, well, what can I say? [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6200.4800000000005s)]
*  Shadjaia is the Chicago of America. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6204.38s)]
*  There's nothing left to say about that. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6206.52s)]
*  Love that. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6210.56s)]
*  I think we should play some of the clips [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6214.36s)]
*  that our wonderful Tamara has put together [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6218.36s)]
*  of some of the highlights of the many times, [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6222.64s)]
*  we had them on four times during this live stream, [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6228.4400000000005s)]
*  day three, day seven, day 20, and day 55, [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6231.4400000000005s)]
*  which was just over a week ago. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6235.4800000000005s)]
*  So Tamara, let's go to that clip. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6239.160000000001s)]
*  Rafat, I think, sorry. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6245.52s)]
*  I just wanted to say, [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6249.0s)]
*  I think one of the hardest things to come to grips with [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6250.6s)]
*  is that the people who always scream the loudest [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6256.6s)]
*  about the Holocaust and say, never again, never again, [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6261.56s)]
*  and we have to learn the lessons of history, [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6264.68s)]
*  particularly American and European leaders, [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6267.360000000001s)]
*  are the ones who are most actively supporting [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6270.92s)]
*  this Holocaust in Gaza. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6274.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm sure a genocide in Gaza. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6276.58s)]
*  They're sending airplanes full of bombs [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6281.14s)]
*  to drop on Palestinian babies. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6283.14s)]
*  And this is the thing that has, for me, [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6286.82s)]
*  broken any sense, any belief I have [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6290.78s)]
*  in all the supposed principles we were taught [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6296.3s)]
*  to revere human rights, international law, democracy. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6300.62s)]
*  The people who come to lecture us [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6306.62s)]
*  about human rights and democracy and international law [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6309.46s)]
*  are the ones who are doing this to you, to your family, [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6313.9s)]
*  to 2.3 million people in Gaza. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6318.82s)]
*  They're the ones who are doing this, [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6321.66s)]
*  the ones who built museums to the Holocaust [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6323.42s)]
*  and say, we need to take Palestinians and Arabs [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6326.099999999999s)]
*  to these Holocaust museums [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6329.62s)]
*  to educate these savages and barbarians, [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6331.82s)]
*  jungle people, as Joseph Burrell, [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6335.7s)]
*  the EU foreign policy chief called them. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6338.34s)]
*  They're the ones. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6341.9s)]
*  The White House spokesperson, Karine Jean-Pierre, [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6343.74s)]
*  said that calls for a ceasefire for Gaza are repugnant. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6347.7s)]
*  What kind of world do we live in [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6352.32s)]
*  where calling for a ceasefire is repugnant? [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6354.46s)]
*  These people worship war. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6358.139999999999s)]
*  They worship death. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6360.5s)]
*  I'm 51 years old and I wake up every day [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6365.1s)]
*  as angry and as enraged and as outraged [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6369.7s)]
*  as I have been my whole life at what they're doing to us. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6374.38s)]
*  But you know, they want us to be nice victims. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6379.46s)]
*  They want us to be polite. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6383.86s)]
*  They don't like it when we're angry. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6385.78s)]
*  I get messages saying, oh, you know, [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6388.52s)]
*  you should present yourselves better. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6391.080000000001s)]
*  You won't win support if you're angry. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6393.080000000001s)]
*  What support did we win for all these years? [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6396.88s)]
*  All these years of advocacy, of meetings, [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6399.88s)]
*  of lectures, of speeches, of meeting with politicians. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6403.240000000001s)]
*  Not one European politician [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6407.76s)]
*  objected to cutting food and water [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6410.8s)]
*  and electricity from children. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6413.96s)]
*  Not one. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6415.84s)]
*  I'm saying not one leader. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6416.96s)]
*  Yes, there were a few politicians, [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6419.36s)]
*  a few members of parliament here or there, [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6420.5599999999995s)]
*  but not one leader. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6423.12s)]
*  Not one Arab country. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6425.719999999999s)]
*  Not one, let aside the Europeans, [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6428.04s)]
*  not one Arab country of those regimes run by traitors [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6430.839999999999s)]
*  withdrew their ambassadors from Israel [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6437.0199999999995s)]
*  or closed their embassies with Israel. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6439.5199999999995s)]
*  What is this? [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6443.16s)]
*  What is this hell we're living in? [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6444.12s)]
*  People come to us for analysis. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6446.56s)]
*  I don't know how to analyze this. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6449.160000000001s)]
*  I don't know what to say to people. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6450.92s)]
*  But we are, our hearts are in pain. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6453.84s)]
*  Our hearts are broken when we see this world [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6458.56s)]
*  that allows the scenery that we're seeing in Gaza today. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6462.4400000000005s)]
*  Massacre after massacre after massacre of whole families [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6466.96s)]
*  of 583 childrens of this morning. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6472.96s)]
*  By the time we finish this live stream, [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6476.72s)]
*  the number will have gone up [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6478.88s)]
*  and people digging in rubble in their bare hands. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6481.2s)]
*  And this is a world that lectures us [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6484.4800000000005s)]

*  I think, thank you, Ali. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6513.74s)]
*  I think we didn't fail. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6516.24s)]
*  We did not. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6518.400000000001s)]
*  And that's when it comes to all comes to end. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6519.76s)]
*  No, we didn't. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6525.12s)]
*  We didn't submit to their barbarity. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6528.400000000001s)]
*  We didn't submit to their brutality. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6529.92s)]
*  And even when Gaza, this attack came when Gaza was [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6533.280000000001s)]
*  in its weakest time possible. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6537.72s)]
*  Look at what they did to the most invincible army [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6541.8s)]
*  in the area, the fourth strongest army in the world. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6544.88s)]
*  The humiliation, the humiliation. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6549.08s)]
*  But it's not only about that. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6555.04s)]
*  This is not where we get our pride. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6556.68s)]
*  We get our pride from staying principled [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6558.320000000001s)]
*  at a time when everybody is not. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6562.68s)]
*  I saw a friend, you know, trashing somebody saying, [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6566.0s)]
*  like he was posting some antisemitic stuff on Twitter, [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6572.08s)]
*  replying, you know, with antisemitic things. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6578.68s)]
*  And he was like, don't do this. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6581.22s)]
*  We're not them. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6583.84s)]
*  And I was very proud. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6587.36s)]
*  It is at this time that people can be, [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6589.5599999999995s)]
*  their metal can be tested, who they are, their character. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6592.5199999999995s)]
*  Those people failed miserably. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6595.84s)]
*  We didn't. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6597.08s)]
*  They failed because when it came to the Ukrainians, [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6597.92s)]
*  blonde hair, blue eyes, everybody was sending money. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6601.24s)]
*  Everybody was posting, even the Israelis were posting [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6605.679999999999s)]
*  pictures how to make a cocktail molotovs. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6608.5599999999995s)]
*  How little children are carrying guns [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6612.58s)]
*  and fighting the Russian barbarians. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6614.3s)]
*  Politicians sending money, billions of dollars competing [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6617.66s)]
*  to send billions of dollars to Ukraine. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6619.94s)]
*  But when it came to people with darker skin, [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6622.7s)]
*  they failed and they failed miserably. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6626.46s)]
*  And I don't want to say I don't know how they sleep [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6629.86s)]
*  because they don't have a conscience. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6632.98s)]
*  There is this anti-Arab, anti-Palestinian, [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6634.86s)]
*  anti-Muslim sentiment that is deeply rooted [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6638.66s)]
*  and normalized in the media, among politicians. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6641.46s)]
*  It's always been there, but it has just been exposed. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6648.82s)]
*  And I think there has to be this day, this week, [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6653.86s)]
*  has to be a time of reconsideration. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6655.82s)]
*  Muslims, Arabs, pro-Palestinians, free people [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6661.34s)]
*  around the world, there has to be something [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6664.66s)]
*  that comes out of this, something stronger [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6666.46s)]
*  than before, more powerful to learn the lesson [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6670.1s)]
*  that those people are in, like they are unreliable. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6674.860000000001s)]
*  They cannot, because some of those, [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6678.860000000001s)]
*  even Bernie Sanders, I don't want to name names because, [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6679.860000000001s)]
*  but they were horrible. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6683.9400000000005s)]
*  I don't want to name names. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6686.22s)]
*  Name the names, now is the time. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6687.06s)]
*  People, exactly, people in the Congress [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6689.780000000001s)]
*  and everybody saw this, Israel was heading towards a genocide [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6693.1s)]
*  and you post 10 tweets explaining why what happened [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6697.34s)]
*  from the Palestinians is wrong, for God's sakes. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6701.42s)]
*  That was from day seven, two months ago. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6709.3s)]
*  Yeah, it's surreal how he reassured us [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6718.66s)]
*  in those moments of just deep brokenness. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6726.82s)]
*  I want to show also the last clip just from a week [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6731.82s)]
*  and a half ago from day 55 and then we'll come back [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6735.38s)]
*  to his students, so let's go to that. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6739.14s)]
*  Well, I don't have the words to express how happy [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6743.94s)]
*  and relieved we are right now to have our good friend, [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6747.26s)]
*  Gryfat Alarir with us live from the Gaza Strip, [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6751.22s)]
*  looking handsome and healthy and the smile is something [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6755.66s)]
*  that we've been waiting weeks and weeks and weeks [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6761.46s)]
*  to see again, so Gryfat, our good friend [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6764.78s)]
*  and our pretty much de facto editor in the Gaza Strip, [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6767.62s)]
*  thank you so much for being with us today. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6773.0599999999995s)]
*  Alhamdulillah, salam, thank you Gryfat, [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6775.18s)]
*  to you and your family and I don't know [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6777.22s)]
*  if Roger Waters is watching today, [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6779.46s)]
*  but I don't want him to be offended by this, [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6781.54s)]
*  but having you on, this is bigger than Roger Waters. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6784.0199999999995s)]
*  Okay, I'll think of a career shift, [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6789.219999999999s)]
*  maybe I sang something, but you need to, [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6791.299999999999s)]
*  like clearly close your ears. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6795.78s)]
*  We'll take it. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6801.179999999999s)]
*  Gryfat, where do we even start? [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6804.0199999999995s)]
*  How are your kids, how's your wife, [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6807.0199999999995s)]
*  how's your family right now? [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6811.42s)]
*  We are fine, struggling like everybody else in Gaza, [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6814.66s)]
*  especially in the Gaza city and the north [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6821.259999999999s)]
*  with barely any food, water, sources, [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6825.339999999999s)]
*  everything running out, even the aid [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6832.099999999999s)]
*  that made its way into Gaza is not enough [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6833.98s)]
*  for my extended family perhaps to eat, [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6838.58s)]
*  in a week and most of it, I took a footage [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6844.82s)]
*  of some of the trucks by the way, [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6847.0199999999995s)]
*  they're not trucks, they're probably half trucks [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6849.139999999999s)]
*  or a quarter of a truck and mostly water bottles, [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6851.78s)]
*  probably every 10, what we need is electricity, [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6859.179999999999s)]
*  fuel, cooking gas and flour, [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6863.82s)]
*  these are the four priorities [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6868.66s)]
*  and we barely had any of these [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6871.3s)]
*  and many people will not be getting any of this [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6875.54s)]
*  because there are too many people. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6879.1s)]
*  The Gaza municipality estimates that there are [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6881.86s)]
*  about 800,000 Palestinians in Gaza city [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6884.94s)]
*  and in the north in Jabalia, Beit Lahya and Beit Hanouk, [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6889.98s)]
*  that's too many people with too few resources [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6895.66s)]
*  or family-wise, I haven't seen my kids [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6901.299999999999s)]
*  since the truce started, they moved to another place [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6904.419999999999s)]
*  and I'm spending most of the time running to places [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6909.099999999999s)]
*  with internet connection so I can be online [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6914.7s)]
*  but they are good. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6919.94s)]
*  Yesterday, only yesterday, we made it to our place [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6922.0199999999995s)]
*  where we live in Tal El Hawa [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6926.179999999999s)]
*  and I posted a video, it's complete and utter destruction. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6928.139999999999s)]
*  I'm not sure how this is going to end [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6934.0599999999995s)]
*  but with what we have now, [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6937.82s)]
*  it's complete and utter destruction. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6939.78s)]
*  Again, I keep citing the World War II as a reference, [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6941.5s)]
*  the destruction we see in pictures [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6946.7s)]
*  is happening right in front of our eyes [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6948.7s)]
*  and that was November 30th and we couldn't reconnect [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6951.98s)]
*  because the electricity had gone out [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6965.5s)]
*  and that was just a few days before he was assassinated. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6969.139999999999s)]
*  We have one more short clip, something that I think just, [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6975.86s)]
*  I was talking about this with John yesterday too, [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6982.259999999999s)]
*  like I'm so honored to have been a part of these live streams [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6984.419999999999s)]
*  with Rafat and with all of our guests [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6992.74s)]
*  and especially the first one that we did on day three [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=6996.299999999999s)]
*  of the bombing when Rafat was talking about [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7001.179999999999s)]
*  the toughest thing that he had in his possession [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7007.379999999999s)]
*  was an Expo marker and to be a part of that, [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7009.86s)]
*  that image and that symbolism has made its way [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7018.54s)]
*  all over the world. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7021.139999999999s)]
*  People are bringing packages of Expo markers [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7022.179999999999s)]
*  to vigils I've seen and there's artwork made of him [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7024.86s)]
*  now holding an Expo marker. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7032.259999999999s)]
*  And so we wanted to just play a little bit from that, [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7035.8s)]
*  from that day three of our live stream [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7041.24s)]
*  and just to be honored to have known him [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7044.6s)]
*  and to be known by him [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7048.0s)]
*  and then we'll come back for our students. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7052.2s)]
*  We know that it's very bleak, it's very dark. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7056.88s)]
*  There's no way out. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7060.68s)]
*  If there's no water, there is no way out, [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7062.72s)]
*  what could we do like drown, like commit mass suicide? [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7067.28s)]
*  Is this what Israel wants? [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7072.0s)]
*  And we're not going to do that. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7074.6s)]
*  And I was telling somebody, some friend the other day [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7076.64s)]
*  that I'm an academic, probably the toughest thing [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7079.64s)]
*  I have at home is an Expo marker. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7083.4800000000005s)]
*  But if the Israelis invade, [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7087.12s)]
*  if the project has charged us open door to door [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7091.0s)]
*  to massacre us, I'm going to use that marker, [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7095.04s)]
*  throw it at the Israeli soldiers, [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7097.72s)]
*  even if that is the last thing that I would be able to do. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7099.84s)]
*  And this is the feeling of everybody we are helpless, [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7103.16s)]
*  we have nothing to lose. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7106.599999999999s)]
*  Ahmed, I know that you wanted to say something [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7117.12s)]
*  about Shadjaiya yourself. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7123.88s)]
*  Go ahead. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7128.4s)]
*  Before that, I just remembered someone, [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7136.72s)]
*  I don't want to mention his name, [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7142.32s)]
*  just because so many times asked me not to mention his name, [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7144.4s)]
*  not to harass him. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7148.28s)]
*  He said, he tweeted that the fat became sour [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7151.48s)]
*  and that he was angry because of all the trauma [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7156.639999999999s)]
*  he's been subjected to. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7162.879999999999s)]
*  And I didn't know what's less, [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7166.48s)]
*  false and less dishonest than this comment. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7174.5199999999995s)]
*  If you had the privilege to be taught by Dr. Rafa'at, [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7182.12s)]
*  you would have understood. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7188.599999999999s)]
*  But even if you weren't a student of his, [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7194.12s)]
*  just listening to all of these interviews and lectures [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7195.92s)]
*  on his YouTube channel, [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7201.4800000000005s)]
*  which I urge everyone to follow and watch his lectures. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7203.16s)]
*  And if you read the poem that Malak recited earlier, [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7207.8s)]
*  you'd realize that he wasn't sour. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7212.2s)]
*  He told us that we have every right to be angry personally [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7216.96s)]
*  because everything here is also personal. [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7220.4400000000005s)]
*  We all lost so many people and so many things, [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7223.04s)]
*  but he wasn't just angry. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7227.16s)]
*  He wasn't just sour. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7229.6s)]
*  That's very dishonest. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7231.76s)]
*  And we always had the hope and also the morality, [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7236.040000000001s)]
*  that the ethics of Dr. Rafa'at. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7244.360000000001s)]
*  He always scolded me personally and many of us [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7246.400000000001s)]
*  for saying the wrong things, [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7249.72s)]
*  even when we had the right, even when we were angry. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7251.92s)]
*  He always taught us to be smart, to be vocal, [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7255.8s)]
*  to be unapologetic, but always true and always [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7258.48s)]
*  for the good reasons and for the righteous reasons. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7262.919999999999s)]
*  And that's what we always learned [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7265.919999999999s)]
*  and we'll continue learning from him. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7269.24s)]
*  About Shija'iya, I also come from Shija'iya, [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7274.32s)]
*  but he always bullied me for being born [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7278.959999999999s)]
*  in a trimal in Shija'iya. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7282.679999999999s)]
*  And he was always, always, always angry at people [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7285.48s)]
*  for not mentioning Shija'iya. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7292.36s)]
*  The last message I received from him Wednesday morning [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7294.36s)]
*  was him telling me that he feels helpless [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7300.639999999999s)]
*  because of what's happening in Shija'iya [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7307.04s)]
*  and that he's proud of our fighters, [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7309.719999999999s)]
*  of our neighbors who are fighting the tanks in Shija'iya, [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7312.2s)]
*  but he feels so helpless because of all the destruction [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7316.24s)]
*  and everything that's happening and because of how nobody [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7319.6s)]
*  talks about Shija'iya and how it's not even mentioned. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7322.96s)]
*  And even when it's mentioned, it's East Gaza, not Shija'iya [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7326.08s)]
*  because yes, he's a proud son of Shija'iya [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7329.84s)]
*  and one of his pushes is to keep Shija'iya [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7333.76s)]
*  in people's minds and we have every right to be proud [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7339.68s)]
*  like he was and like he is in our fighters [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7343.12s)]
*  who fight in Shija'iya, but also we need to remember Shija'iya [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7347.12s)]
*  and talk about Shija'iya and all the destruction [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7350.92s)]
*  that's been happening in Shija'iya [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7353.08s)]
*  and all the other neighborhoods of Gaza. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7354.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7358.56s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7359.96s)]
*  Ahmed, I hope that you will write about Shija'iya. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7361.24s)]
*  I just want to share one thing [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7365.32s)]
*  because watching those clips again, [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7367.5599999999995s)]
*  I know it's emotional for everyone. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7374.44s)]
*  There was one show we had, [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7378.719999999999s)]
*  this was during one of the blackouts, [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7382.08s)]
*  the communications blackouts in Gaza [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7385.12s)]
*  when we couldn't reach the Fatwid one, [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7388.28s)]
*  we wanted to have him on, [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7391.280000000001s)]
*  we wanted to have him as many times as we could, [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7392.4800000000005s)]
*  but we couldn't reach him. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7395.6s)]
*  And this was day 45 of the war of the genocide [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7397.68s)]
*  and we had Yusuf on and we wanted to have Yusuf [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7402.96s)]
*  and the ref had together, but we couldn't. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7407.96s)]
*  So we instead, we had a discussion about the ref [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7410.56s)]
*  we talked about his work and his impact. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7415.76s)]
*  We talked about how important the ref was [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7420.76s)]
*  for so many reasons, but especially to us [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7426.04s)]
*  at the Electronic Intifada, because many, [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7428.8s)]
*  I would say most of the writers who write for us [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7434.0s)]
*  from Gaza today and about Gaza today, [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7439.0s)]
*  were trained by the ref. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7441.88s)]
*  And nurtured and encouraged by ref hat. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7443.4s)]
*  And so the Electronic Intifada as a publication [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7445.36s)]
*  would not be what it is without the ref's effort. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7449.0s)]
*  And so I wanted people to know who he was. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7452.16s)]
*  He'd already been on the live stream, [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7456.12s)]
*  but ref hat is not somebody who brags. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7457.759999999999s)]
*  He's not somebody who says, I did this and I did that. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7462.759999999999s)]
*  He's a very humble person. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7466.759999999999s)]
*  And so it was important for us to have Yusuf [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7468.92s)]
*  acknowledge his presence in that show. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7472.88s)]
*  And afterwards, some days afterwards, he sent me a message. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7478.52s)]
*  He said, I downloaded the episode with Ahmed. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7483.84s)]
*  We had Ahmed Masoud as well from London, [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7487.96s)]
*  but ref hat wrote, I downloaded the episode with Ahmed [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7493.4400000000005s)]
*  and Yusuf and John on YouTube, [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7497.36s)]
*  watched it last night at home. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7500.0s)]
*  Really, thanks for the nice words. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7502.24s)]
*  They mean the world to me, [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7504.4800000000005s)]
*  especially coming from an arch enemy like Yusuf. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7506.16s)]
*  And so I, those of you who know, those of you. [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7512.44s)]
*  And then when he got cut off on that final appearance, [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7520.12s)]
*  when we couldn't reconnect with him, [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7524.04s)]
*  and sadly that was the last time, [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7526.68s)]
*  he sent me a message. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7528.96s)]
*  He said that he was mad that he got cut off [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7530.08s)]
*  because he said, I wanted to rebut all of Yusuf's lies. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7533.28s)]
*  So those of you who know ref hat and Yusuf [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7539.52s)]
*  will know that that was an act [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7544.76s)]
*  that ref hat carried on for years, [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7548.04s)]
*  that Yusuf was his enemy. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7550.88s)]
*  But from the times I spent with you both, [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7553.56s)]
*  I know Yusuf how much ref hat loved you dearly. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7556.36s)]
*  And that was his way of expressing it. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7560.679999999999s)]
*  Yes, and the thing that makes me happy [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7566.36s)]
*  is that ref hat was able to watch what I said about him [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7571.96s)]
*  when he was still physically with us. [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7577.48s)]
*  And I think it's important that, [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7581.599999999999s)]
*  and I'm sure that there are also many other people [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7583.759999999999s)]
*  who conveyed to ref hat how much they appreciated him [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7586.5599999999995s)]
*  and they loved his work and dedication to us as students, [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7591.919999999999s)]
*  but also to Palestine. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7597.599999999999s)]
*  This is the least we can do and tell ref hat. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7600.839999999999s)]
*  I will cherish this title in the most, [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7607.959999999999s)]
*  ironic way, ref hat's arch enemy. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7613.48s)]
*  As he called me and accused me of trying to out ref hat him [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7618.839999999999s)]
*  or outsmart him. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7624.24s)]
*  But ref hat is many things to me, [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7627.16s)]
*  but the most important thing is that I am his student. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7629.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Malek and Noor, [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7638.0s)]
*  did you wanna have some time for any final thoughts [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7641.48s)]
*  on ref hat and what he meant to you? [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7646.4s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7649.719999999999s)]
*  I always remember him with one tiny thing he used to do, [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7650.719999999999s)]
*  especially with me because I hate it [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7656.5199999999995s)]
*  when people mispronounce my name. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7658.4s)]
*  I hate it when people say Malek [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7661.32s)]
*  and he would always, always call me Malek. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7663.12s)]
*  And then when I started calling him Dr. Raffat, [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7668.04s)]
*  instead of Riffat, he started calling me Saadi. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7671.08s)]
*  And I was like, I beg you, go back to Malek. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7674.36s)]
*  I'm happy with Malek, please go back to Malek. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7678.4s)]
*  My mom, I managed to talk to my mom today [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7684.2s)]
*  after three days of trying [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7687.2s)]
*  and I was so blessed to talk to her. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7689.72s)]
*  And the first thing I swear, the first thing she said, [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7691.64s)]
*  Malek Habibti, I hope you're doing good [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7695.48s)]
*  because I only knew about Dr. Riffat yesterday [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7697.44s)]
*  and I couldn't stop thinking about you. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7699.92s)]
*  I know how he meant to you, how much he meant to you. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7702.96s)]
*  And it just breaks my heart because I wanted, [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7706.08s)]
*  I wanted to make sure my mom's doing okay [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7709.76s)]
*  and she turned out to be so worried about me [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7712.64s)]
*  because we lost someone so dear. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7715.64s)]
*  I don't know what to say. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7722.8s)]
*  It's just how life is. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7723.8s)]
*  I may his soul rest in power. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7726.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7733.5199999999995s)]
*  Noor and Khalid. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7735.36s)]
*  Khalid, let's start with you. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7740.5599999999995s)]
*  Just remembered something funny that happened with us [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7745.76s)]
*  while we were taking the poetry course [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7751.44s)]
*  with Dr. Raffat. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7754.5199999999995s)]
*  Like he was, we were about to finish Shakespeare, [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7756.72s)]
*  that period of Shakespeare. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7760.84s)]
*  We were moving to the other period. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7763.5599999999995s)]
*  So the students were comparing like who is, [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7766.0s)]
*  maybe Shakespeare is not the better poet. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7768.76s)]
*  Like he was, he was, he was respecting Shakespeare [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7771.5199999999995s)]
*  and loving Shakespeare. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7775.8s)]
*  So he said like everyone has like his thought [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7777.92s)]
*  but the most, one thing you have to know about Dr. Riffat [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7782.2s)]
*  is that he loved watching football [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7787.08s)]
*  and he always liked, it was that who loved Barcelona. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7788.64s)]
*  I don't know how to say it in English. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7793.64s)]
*  He loved Missy very much. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7794.96s)]
*  Like he thought like Missy is the ideal football player. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7797.12s)]
*  He was always fighting for him. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7802.72s)]
*  Maybe Mr. Ahmed Nihad knows that. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7804.2s)]
*  So some students stood up and said like, [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7807.8s)]
*  yeah, there are people that saying that there are no God. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7810.68s)]
*  So he, Dr. Riffat looked at him and said, [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7814.68s)]
*  yeah, there are some people who are saying Grinaldi [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7816.84s)]
*  is better than Missy. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7818.76s)]
*  And like we all started laughing because like we knew [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7820.8s)]
*  he always loved football, loved Missy. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7823.68s)]
*  We're gonna play one final clip, [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7836.200000000001s)]
*  but before we do, Asa, [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7839.64s)]
*  I know that we've just been flooded with so much love [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7843.84s)]
*  for all of our guests here today [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7847.24s)]
*  for the just immense amount of love for Riffat [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7851.04s)]
*  and how that love was received by him. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7856.08s)]
*  Let's go to a few of the comments that we've received. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7861.76s)]
*  Yeah, well, it would be absolutely impossible to read out [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7866.32s)]
*  all of the support that we've had on the live stream today. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7872.32s)]

*  still brings laughter and smiles during this sad time. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7901.88s)]

*  and will motivate our activism and stories [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7917.4s)]

*  they were learning about Dr. Riffat for the first time now. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7965.679999999999s)]
*  And that learning about him and his stories [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7973.04s)]
*  and the work that he inspired would motivate them further. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7979.04s)]

*  who shared their stories and their reflections today. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=7999.92s)]
*  And we're conscious that you are [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8004.96s)]
*  but as immense and awesome as you are, [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8008.56s)]
*  you're just a small group of those who Riffat trained [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8013.28s)]
*  and taught and influenced for the better. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8018.92s)]
*  And so we send our love to all of Riffat's students [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8022.28s)]

*  And just to say that if we look at the front page [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8036.639999999999s)]

*  And that's going to continue. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8051.28s)]
*  Riffat was, people have called him the storyteller of Gaza. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8053.28s)]
*  I've seen him also called the man [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8058.88s)]
*  who taught Gaza to speak English. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8063.28s)]
*  There are many great titles people are giving Riffat. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8066.08s)]
*  We really owe him for, he helped open Gaza to me. [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8071.88s)]

*  thank you and please do keep writing. [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8096.04s)]
*  We feel like we are now part of a bigger family [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8100.28s)]
*  and Riffat connects us all. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8104.68s)]

*  that we have prepared of Riffat giving a lecture. [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8127.6s)]
*  Now, how many of you, [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8133.52s)]
*  like have you ever been to Jerusalem? [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8135.76s)]
*  Raise your hand if you've ever been to Jerusalem. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8137.04s)]
*  Like we have 60 students here. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8141.08s)]
*  We have one, two, probably three. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8142.320000000001s)]
*  That's very few of you. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8144.0s)]
*  We've never been to Jerusalem. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8147.88s)]
*  We're Palestinians, we're living in Gaza. [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8148.72s)]
*  We can't go to Jerusalem because of the Israeli occupation. [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8150.08s)]
*  But we love Jerusalem, right? [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8155.48s)]
*  Yes. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8157.12s)]
*  We love Jerusalem because of what it means to us. [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8159.68s)]
*  We've never been there. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8163.0s)]
*  But believe me, when you go there, [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8164.92s)]
*  you will feel that you've been there hundreds of times [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8166.8s)]
*  because you read about Jerusalem in literature, in history. [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8169.88s)]
*  Of course, it doesn't mean that, [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8173.2s)]
*  we should take Jerusalem in the poem or in the story, [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8174.4800000000005s)]
*  and that's it, no. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8179.24s)]
*  But in literature, Jerusalem is back to us, comes back to us. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8181.84s)]
*  It's true that there is suffering, there is pain, [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8186.68s)]
*  there's occupation, and that's why Tamim al-Bargouti [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8188.92s)]
*  as a Palestinian poet, as a young Palestinian poet, [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8191.88s)]
*  I think is doing a great service to the Palestinian cause [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8194.24s)]
*  and the Palestinian struggle. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8198.76s)]
*  When you read Tamim or you listen to him [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8201.16s)]
*  reciting his poem, Filqouti or other poems, [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8203.08s)]
*  he brings you a lot, he takes you to Jerusalem. [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8205.28s)]
*  You live Jerusalem. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8207.92s)]
*  He takes you back to it. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8210.68s)]
*  You liberate it for just a little bit of time. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8211.84s)]
*  And if there is hope, if you can imagine a free Palestine, [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8216.56s)]
*  free Jerusalem, probably, you will work towards that. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8221.08s)]
*  And the same thing applies to occupied Palestine. [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8225.76s)]
*  We've never been to other parts of Palestine, [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8227.84s)]
*  because of the Israeli occupation, [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8230.759999999998s)]
*  but we've been told so many times by our parents [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8231.599999999999s)]
*  and grandparents, especially our mothers, [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8234.24s)]
*  they've been telling us stories about Palestine, [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8236.4s)]
*  Yeml-e-Blad in the past, the good old days, [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8238.359999999999s)]
*  how Palestine was, you know, all nice and beautiful, [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8240.48s)]
*  unoccupied, unreg. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8245.08s)]
*  And therefore I say in this case, [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8249.48s)]
*  how our homeland turns into a story. [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8254.0s)]
*  In reality, we can't have it, we don't have it, [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8260.119999999999s)]
*  but it can turn into poems, into poetry, [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8262.88s)]
*  into literature, into stories. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8265.039999999999s)]
*  So our homeland turns into a story. [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8266.64s)]
*  We love our homeland because of the story. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8271.0s)]
*  We love our homeland because of the story, [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8276.72s)]
*  and we love the story because it's about our homeland. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8278.519999999999s)]
*  And this connection is significant. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8282.08s)]
*  Israel wants to sever this relationship, for example, [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8284.919999999998s)]
*  between Palestinians and land, [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8287.44s)]
*  Palestinian and Jerusalem and other places and cities. [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8288.960000000001s)]
*  And literature attaches us back, [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8292.52s)]
*  connects us strongly to Palestine. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8294.92s)]
*  So in my imagination, in my thinking actually, [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8299.2s)]
*  this is a very significant thing [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8303.32s)]
*  that literature contributes to, [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8306.04s)]
*  creating realities, creating realities, [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8309.960000000001s)]
*  making the impossible sound possible. [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8313.560000000001s)]
*  We love you, Rifat. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8318.44s)]
*  Just wanna say thank you again to all of our friends, [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8323.480000000001s)]

*  and everyone who was here beforehand. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8334.32s)]
*  Thank you all so much. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8337.52s)]

*  as Ali said, many of them, if not all of them right now [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcjoB_K3Dgw&t=8348.480000000001s)]
