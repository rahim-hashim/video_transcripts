Video Description: On episode 31 of The Electronic Intifada Podcast, Nora and Asa discuss Israel‚Äôs vaccine apartheid and are joined by physicians and writers Dr. Ghada Karmi and Dr. Osama Tanous.
It was recently reported that Israel is giving thousands of ‚Äúspare‚Äù vaccines to foreign countries in exchange for political support, while denying vaccines to 5 million Palestinians under its military rule in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Israel is failing in its obligations under international law as an occupying power by not offering the vaccine to the Palestinians of occupied territory.
Karmi and Tanous explain how occupation and settler-colonialism impact not just COVID-19 outcomes for Palestinians but public health in Palestine overall.
‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt seen the peak‚Äù of the pandemic yet, Tanous warns. ‚ÄúThe worst is yet to come.‚Äù
In Palestine, ‚Äúoccupation is a pre-existing condition‚Äù that can present disastrous health outcomes for Palestinians dealing with COVID-19, he adds.
In denying Palestinians access to vaccines, Karmi says that ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre dealing with a deeply criminal state.‚Äù Israel ‚Äúhas to be punished for the things that it‚Äôs done,‚Äù she says.
‚ÄúOne would have thought that Israel had reached the bottom in terms of the outrageous things that it‚Äôs done to the Palestinians, but every time, Israel takes me by surprise. There is still a new low to get to,‚Äù Karmi adds.
The way to deal with Israel‚Äôs criminality ‚Äúhas to be through action,‚Äù she explains. ‚ÄúIt has to be made into a pariah, exactly as happened with South Africa ‚Ä¶ We have a thriving, successful BDS movement ‚Ä¶ and I urge everybody who wants to do something to start off, at least, with joining the movement.‚Äù

# Israel's vaccine apartheid with Osama Tanous and Ghada Karmi | EI Podcast
**The Electronic Intifada:** [March 02, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM)
*  We're going to be talking about the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=0.0s)]
*  most dangerous state in the world. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=3.44s)]
*  We're going to be talking about the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=5.96s)]
*  most dangerous state in the world. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=8.38s)]
*  You have to spell it out and you have to tell it like it is. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=10.540000000000001s)]
*  This is a deeply criminal state which should never be allowed to get away with this. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  It's not only accountable, it's punishable. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=20.88s)]
*  The electronic intifada. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=24.76s)]
*  This is the Electronic Intifada Podcast. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=28.84s)]
*  I'm Nora Barrows-Freedman. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=31.84s)]
*  And I'm Asa Wyn Stanley. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=34.84s)]
*  And welcome back to the Electronic Intifada Podcast. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=40.84s)]
*  I'm Nora Barrows-Freedman with Asa Wyn Stanley [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=43.84s)]
*  and we have a fantastic episode for you today. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=47.84s)]
*  Yeah, we've just filmed an interview [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=51.84s)]
*  about with two Palestinian doctors, medical doctors. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=55.84s)]
*  And it went really well I think, Nora. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=61.84s)]
*  How do you think it went? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=65.84s)]
*  Absolutely. I mean I think, so when we talk about [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=66.84s)]
*  Israel's vaccine apartheid, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=70.84s)]
*  which is happening right now, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=75.84s)]
*  and has been, Israel denying Palestinians under its military occupation [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=77.84s)]
*  access to the vaccines [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=84.84s)]
*  and blaming them for their own health outcomes, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=87.84s)]
*  of course Israel being the occupying power [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=91.84s)]
*  and obliged to follow the Geneva Conventions and all international laws that pertain. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=93.84s)]
*  You know, it's important to really expose Israel for what it is [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=101.84s)]
*  And you'll hear Dr. Khadakarmi talk about [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=107.84s)]
*  how important it is to understand Israel as a colonial apartheid state. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=112.84s)]
*  And so everything that Israel says it's doing, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=121.84s)]
*  you know, oh, we're a vaccine leader, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=123.84s)]
*  we are the start-up nation, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=125.84s)]
*  using all this wonderful technology to inoculate our citizens. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=128.84s)]
*  It's important to understand that that is an essential public relations campaign [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=133.84s)]
*  meant to distract the world from the crimes that Israel takes part in every day [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=140.84s)]
*  as a settler colony state. Yeah. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=146.84s)]
*  Yeah, it's like when South Africa used to say that it was sort of bringing civilization to Africa, right? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=150.84s)]
*  People are so much better off, right? Yeah. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=156.84s)]
*  Yeah, apartheid, the apartheid white supremacist government of South Africa, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=160.84s)]
*  you know, presented itself as this bulwark against communism [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=165.84s)]
*  and, you know, as outpost of civilization amongst the so-called savages. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=168.84s)]
*  And Israel portrays itself in very much the same way. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=173.84s)]
*  And its attitude towards the vaccine is another illustration of that. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=176.84s)]
*  And it's a really stark illustration of Israeli apartheid. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=183.84s)]
*  Yeah, and Israeli former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=187.84s)]
*  you know, from the supposedly left-wing Israeli Labour Party, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=192.84s)]
*  used to refer to Israel as a villa in the jungle, you know. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=198.84s)]
*  So presumably, you know, in this analogy, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=204.84s)]
*  the Arabs are these wild animals or, you know, naked savages [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=207.84s)]
*  amongst this sort of colonial villa in the jungle, and that's Israel. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=211.84s)]
*  Right, and that's been normalized. That like shockingly racist, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=215.84s)]
*  just disgusting colonial, you know, smear campaign against Palestinians is very normal. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=219.84s)]
*  Yeah, it's a really, I mean, I think it has opened a lot of people's eyes, I think. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=228.84s)]
*  I mean, you'll see viewers, you'll see in the interview now with Dr. Ghada talking about how, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=233.84s)]
*  you know, how Israel is still not held accountable for these crimes, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=242.84s)]
*  and does get away with all these things of what we need to do to try and change that. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=246.84s)]
*  But I think on the popular level, this situation is really stark, you know. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=251.84s)]
*  You've got a situation where Israel claims, oh, where we are, we're occupying all our citizens, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=256.84000000000003s)]
*  we're vaccinating all our citizens. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=262.84000000000003s)]
*  But the reality is that, you know, you've got about roughly six million Israeli Jews [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=267.84s)]
*  and, you know, roughly six and a half million Palestinian Arabs living in historic Palestine [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=275.84s)]
*  between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, you know, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=282.84s)]
*  roughly more or less equal in terms of population numbers, you know, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=286.84s)]
*  maybe a little more on the Palestinian side. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=291.84s)]
*  It's a little, it's, you know, it's all very, it's a little bit uncertain the exact figures [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=293.84s)]
*  because these are obfuscated by the Israelis, Israeli regime, but more or less it's roughly 50-50. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=298.84s)]
*  And yet five million Palestinians living in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, you know, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=305.84s)]
*  the vast majority of Palestinians have absolutely no entitlement to vaccines [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=311.84s)]
*  from the government that rules their destinies, the Israeli government, you know, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=316.84s)]
*  the Israeli occupation government. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=320.84s)]
*  And it's a really stark illustration of what we mean when we say apartheid. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=322.84s)]
*  I'm really excited that we also got to talk to Dr. Osama Tanous. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=328.84s)]
*  He's a physician based in Haifa. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=331.84s)]
*  And he talks about the, you know, the machinations of Israel's apartheid, you know, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=333.84s)]
*  in vaccine apartheid, medical apartheid, and how it also furthers the settler colonial state. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=343.84s)]
*  And just absolutely essential analysis from both Dr. Ghada and Dr. Osama. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=351.84s)]
*  Thank you to all our listeners and viewers. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=360.84s)]

*  Welcome back to the Electronic Intifada podcast. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=440.84s)]
*  I'm Nora Barrows-Freedman in California. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=443.84s)]
*  And I'm Mason Stanley in London. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=446.84s)]
*  Let's get right into it. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=448.84s)]
*  Today, we're going to be talking about Israel's vaccine apartheid and how occupation [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=449.84s)]
*  and colonialism impacts not just COVID-19 outcomes for Palestinians under occupation, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=454.84s)]
*  but public health in Palestine overall. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=460.84s)]
*  Joining us are two physicians, writers and experts on public health in Palestine, Dr. Osama Tanous. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=463.84s)]
*  Joining us from Atlanta and Dr. Khadda Karmie in London. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=470.84s)]
*  Thank you both so much for being with us on the Electronic Intifada podcast. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=475.84s)]
*  Thank you for having us. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=479.84s)]
*  So let's start with you Osama. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=482.84s)]
*  If you could talk about the facts on the ground in Palestine right now, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=485.84s)]
*  what does it mean to have five million Palestinians under occupation blocked from getting the vaccine by Israel? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=489.84s)]
*  While Israel is sending, for example, this week it was revealed, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=499.84s)]
*  Israel is sending other countries extra vaccines of theirs in exchange for political support. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=503.84s)]
*  What does the paint us a picture of what it looks like right now? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=509.84s)]
*  Thank you, Nora. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=514.8399999999999s)]
*  Well, yeah, I think when you ask about Palestine, it's another opportunity to remind our audience that Palestine is a fragmented geographical unit. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=515.8399999999999s)]
*  Right. And this really correlates to the whole entire crisis that, you know, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=525.8399999999999s)]
*  when you want to try to define where is the occupied Palestinian territories, where is Israel, where does this start and where does this end? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=530.84s)]
*  It's all basically, you know, we need to remember that that geography and that fragmented geography has been created by the colonial expansion, right, by frontier colonial expansion. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=537.84s)]
*  So you have Gaza, which is also a deficiently created piece of land created and bordered by the Israeli expansion in 1948, also the West Bank. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=549.84s)]
*  And then you have settlements inside the West Bank that kind of have Israeli sovereignty on them and connected them [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=561.84s)]
*  versus the rest of the West Bank that is an entirely fragmented also geographical piece without sovereignty on the land. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=569.84s)]
*  Right. So what we see as Palestine and Israel, Palestine is a very fragmented geography with a different health care system. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=579.84s)]
*  So while the Israeli health care system is a kind of strong, developed, well established, also, you know, to remember that that started before 48. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=587.84s)]
*  It started as a settler colonial infrastructure to support the colonization of Palestine. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=597.84s)]
*  And then it really had, you know, sovereignty on the ground, had the funding and good planning and so on. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=603.84s)]
*  The Palestinian health care system generally, as of the rest of everything in the occupied Palestinian territory, was a product of occupation, of not having sovereignty on the plan, on the land, not having import export, not being able to really conduct health policies. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=611.84s)]
*  And this is why when we talk about health care in Palestine, we talk about a very fragmented and weak health care system that compromises also of governmental actors, of non-governmental organizations, of the honor war, of profit organization, and all of that in a chaotic, you know, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=628.84s)]
*  of different actors who work also on the ground, but you have different shades of accessibility, different kinds of insurances. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=646.84s)]
*  And, you know, in Gaza, it's completely under siege. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=656.84s)]
*  So also that weak health care system is under the control of Israel, basically, because it cannot import or export. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=661.84s)]
*  And that is why you have such huge differences in the health care provision. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=669.84s)]
*  But that also comes to emphasize that Israel has a legal duty to vaccinate the Palestinians. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=677.84s)]
*  Israel is the occupying power, although you have the Palestinian authority as a local governing body that kind of has some kind of limited authority in some places of Palestine. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=686.84s)]
*  It is by no means the ruling body. The ruling body in all of Mandate historical Palestine is the Israeli occupation. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=698.84s)]
*  The vast majority of the West Bank is Area C, so it's under Israeli direct military control. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=705.84s)]
*  And according to the Geneva, the Fourth Geneva Conviction, the ruling, the occupying power has the duty to provide health care to the people who are occupies. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=712.84s)]
*  That, of course, is paradoxical when we think about why would an occupier who occupies a population want to deliver health care? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=723.84s)]
*  Why would it want its best if it's really trying to make it subhuman, to occupy it, to exploit it? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=730.84s)]
*  That comes because occupation was never meant to be something that is long lasting. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=738.84s)]
*  Occupation was meant to be temporary, and that's why you have these laws to allow occupation to be non-sustainable and to be exhausting to the occupying power. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=743.84s)]
*  This is not the case in Israel. Israel runs a kind of a very easy occupation that doesn't cost it a lot. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=755.84s)]
*  To the contrary, it benefits it because it has a huge captive market of also workers and markets that consume its goods. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=762.84s)]
*  And this is why, you know, and from that, Israel is not fulfilling its duty of providing vaccination to the Palestinians. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=770.84s)]
*  So if you want to see the facts on the ground, we can see a very well-oiled machine inside the 48 areas inside Israel that runs a massive vaccination campaign [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=778.84s)]
*  versus in the Palestinian territories, the occupied Palestinian territories that are dependent on Israeli permission, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=788.84s)]
*  even for, you know, the entrance of COVID tests or vaccination of whatnot of the entire health care system, then you have a very chaotic. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=795.84s)]
*  Also, we might be need to mention that the PA is being nothing but professional or transparent in that sense. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=803.84s)]
*  So also how vaccinations are being distributed or to whom they are being distributed and what criteria and so on. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=811.84s)]
*  Of course, the PA is not a good model for ruling and it has never really paid much attention to the health care of its population. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=818.84s)]
*  It has invested massively on security forces and so on. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=827.84s)]
*  Of course, security that doesn't provide security to its population and has neglected health care. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=831.84s)]
*  So you have very different landscapes if you're in Israel or Palestine. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=836.84s)]
*  Asama, you've written for the Journal of Palestinian Studies last year about the public health emergency during the COVID-19 pandemic. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=842.84s)]
*  And you argued that, quote, the health care system, an essential pillar, an infrastructural foundation of the settler colonial project, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=856.84s)]
*  is naively imagined as an apolitical neutral sphere. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=868.84s)]
*  Throughout the process, settler militarism, settler symbols and settler domination have continued to be normalized. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=873.84s)]
*  Could you talk a little bit about that and about how Israel has taken advantage of the pandemic to further its own ends? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=880.84s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. Yeah, I wrote that, you know, it was in the peak of the pandemic when Israel has completely militarized and securitized the public health emergency. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=887.84s)]
*  So you saw different actors. First of all, you know, in Israel, it's a heavy militarized country and heavy militarized state. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=897.84s)]
*  So it's very hard to distinguish, you know, between the civil sphere and the military sphere because everything, whether it's academia, health care, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=904.84s)]
*  you know, everything is very much militarized. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=912.84s)]
*  But when the pandemic had, although Israel has a very, you know, as we say, sophisticated health care system, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=916.84s)]
*  it really brought in different actors like the Israeli intelligence, the Shin Bet and Mossad to kind of take over. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=923.84s)]
*  And they were, you know, tracking the patients with COVID. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=931.84s)]
*  They were sitting on a sitting facilities for quarantine. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=934.84s)]
*  And we saw a heavy militarization of the mobilization of the army into the hospitals and into the towns, you know, in order to provide the testing centers and vaccination. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=938.84s)]
*  And this is incredibly for the Israeli society. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=950.84s)]
*  This is normal because they are mostly, you know, you have obligatory military, they are part of the military and so on. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=953.84s)]
*  For us Palestinians in that health care system, it was alarming, you know, to be to see the military becoming so normalized as a normal acting body, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=960.84s)]
*  you know, in our towns, inside the hospitals where 20 percent or something of the physicians inside the Israeli hospitals are Palestinians, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=971.84s)]
*  Palestinians inside the citizens of Israel also regarding nursing and the entire staff. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=981.84s)]
*  So in that and what really struck me is that you had the, you know, Israel was kind of trying to celebrate its health care. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=986.84s)]
*  And it was really celebrated in the New York Times and Washington Post, how successful and beautiful this model is, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=994.84s)]
*  where you have Palestinian and Israelis working hand in hand and so on. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1000.84s)]
*  So like this, you know, United Front. But that even was militarized. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1004.84s)]
*  It was described as brothers in arms, you know, as if like the both of us are soldiers in the front line of. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1007.84s)]
*  So the whole description of COVID and fighting COVID became completely militarized. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1014.84s)]
*  And even Palestinian doctors starting using militarized jargon for describing themselves, you know, as like militant on the front. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1020.84s)]
*  And that was like really alarming for me. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1027.84s)]
*  And I really needed to state that that how these processes, if you're not aware of them, they can really infiltrate you so slowly. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1029.84s)]
*  And then they become normalized and hyper normalized. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1037.84s)]
*  So it becomes completely normal seeing army inside the hospitals, seeing the army not as an occupying army, you know, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1039.84s)]
*  but as something normal actor in the management of the crisis. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1047.84s)]
*  So it was really important to stretch that out. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1057.84s)]
*  And you had it was really surprising even for many physicians were kind of adapting these symbols quite normally. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1061.84s)]
*  I want to bring you in as well. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1074.84s)]
*  Can you talk a little bit about the what you what you think about when when you see the incredible has brought the propaganda program that Israel has rolled out that Osama just referred to that it is, you know, the leading, you know, force of, you know, vaccinating its its population, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1078.84s)]
*  that it's, you know, really just top of the line. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1102.84s)]
*  You know, it's kind of like the kind of tech washing of Israel as a startup nation, you know, all these innovations. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1106.84s)]
*  Meanwhile, of course, Palestinians aren't able to get the vaccine. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1113.84s)]
*  And that usually, you know, when the New York Times or Washington Post talks about it, it's usually at the very bottom of the story that oh, yeah, by the way, you know, Israel is not allowing Palestinians to access the vaccine. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1118.84s)]
*  There was even a New York Times article in the last couple of days where the sub headline was critics say what was it? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1132.84s)]
*  It was. Yeah, Israel gives vaccine to far off allies as Palestinians wait. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1140.84s)]
*  And the and the subhead was critics say Israel has an obligation to inoculate Palestinians as though international law was just like a, you know, a critic of opinion. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1146.84s)]
*  Talk about what what you're seeing and and what this says about Israel's, you know, colonialism at this point. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1158.84s)]
*  Yeah, look, the way to understand the vaccination story is the same way as one understands anything to do with Israel politically. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1168.84s)]
*  There is no other way to see it and to understand it. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1180.84s)]
*  The context is political and everything Israelis do has a political aim. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1185.84s)]
*  And the vaccination is no different whatsoever, because what's happened is that, as we've just heard very ably, I must say from the summer, what's happened is that Israel is indeed a world leader. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1192.84s)]
*  There's no question in the vaccination program for its own citizens. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1207.84s)]
*  One has to stress. It's very far from that for the Palestinians. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1212.84s)]
*  And what we have here is a classic example of apartheid in the medical in the medical sphere. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1219.84s)]
*  The fact that Israel promotes this and has a very good slick PR operation is not surprising. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1229.84s)]
*  It's something which we've seen from Israel for decades. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1237.84s)]
*  We just applied the same thing applied to a new field, whatever that might happen to be. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1242.84s)]
*  You know, the extraordinary thing about all this is that the facts, which are really shocking, the facts are shocking. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1249.84s)]
*  The extraordinary thing is the way that it's accepted. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1261.84s)]
*  It's accepted in the Western world as somehow that's the way things are. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1266.84s)]
*  You pointed to the New York Times article, of course, there are many, many more that accept the subtext behind Israel's success, i.e. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1272.84s)]
*  they don't do anything for the people that they rule, the half of the people they rule, whom they have, they give nothing to, no rights, no nothing. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1283.84s)]
*  And what I think about it is that if you look at the facts, you see that Israel has offered the Palestinians a miserable 5000 vaccine doses. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1295.84s)]
*  And even that, barely, they held up in the last week, they've held up a consignment of vaccines from the Russians of the Russian vaccine, held them up for two days, no reason why, they just spiked. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1312.84s)]
*  And the attitude to the Palestinians under their rule, I don't like the word occupation, they just simply rule them. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1331.84s)]
*  The Palestinians under their rule is one of clear, clear apartheid. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1343.84s)]
*  And now we know that Palestinians are paying the price because nearly 200,000 cases have been reported in the Palestinian territory. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1352.84s)]
*  Over 2000 people have died from Covid and that is striking, I tell you why, because the precautions taken by the PA in the West Bank and by Hamas in Gaza have been really impressive. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1366.84s)]
*  They are well aware they don't have the medical facilities because again, Israel refuses to supply the Palestinians with the sufficiency of ventilators, of protective clothing, of medication, and the Palestinians know it and they know they have the medical hospital capacity. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1381.84s)]
*  So they had to be pretty careful about public behavior and they succeeded really in large part because the numbers I'm quoting could have been very, very much larger. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1403.84s)]
*  So I think we acknowledge that and, you know, credit for it. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1414.84s)]
*  But the irony here is that Israel is not only behaving in a criminal and in an illegal way, it's also a stupid way to do things. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1422.84s)]
*  If one knows anything about their epidemiology and about the way viruses spread, one knows immediately that borders, lines and so on are meaningless. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1438.84s)]
*  Now, even with the reduction in Palestinian labor from the occupied territories into Israel, even with that, thousands of Palestinian workers cross over into Israel every day and do jobs for Israelis. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1452.84s)]
*  They are a source of infection. I mean, it's just completely stupid that they deny them. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1468.84s)]
*  But, you know, the overall point that I wish people would take from this is, first of all, never accept what Israel says because almost certainly one finds it's an issue of lies and fake illegal argument. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1475.84s)]
*  We know that occupied territories are subject to the Geneva Convention and particularly the force, particularly with healthcare, and that the occupying power has the responsibility, the legal responsibility to provide healthcare amongst which vaccinations are available. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1497.84s)]
*  Now, the Israeli argument is that the Oslo Agreement of 1993 gave the Palestinian Authority the responsibility for the healthcare of the population. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1519.84s)]
*  And, you know, if you look at it at this side and read what Oslo Accords says superficially, and it seems to be plausible, but of course it's not because you look very carefully, you'll see that the things that it does not apply to are vaccinations of this order of this magnitude. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1535.84s)]
*  It might be about measles or something like this, but not this kind of epidemic. So it's nonsense. The whole thing is nonsense. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1556.84s)]
*  I don't want to take up too much time because I hope people will ask me a question. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1566.84s)]
*  I just wanted to say that honestly, at the end of the day, the case against Israel is proven over and over again. This is an apartheid state, which is a criminal state, which has committed countless crimes against the Palestinian people. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1571.84s)]
*  The question is not whether it has come back. It has evidently come back. The question is why do people accept this from Israel? Why is Israel allowed the impunity that it is? In my mind, that is the key question about everything to do with Israel. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1589.84s)]
*  May I add some points? Thank you, Gada, for the excellent point. I just want to add that it's not just the New York Times or the Washington Post that were celebrating Israel, even medical journals like the Lancet, when the Lancet Palestinian Health Alliance published a paper, an opinion saying that Israel has the obligation and the duty to vaccinate Palestinians. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1613.84s)]
*  They published a ridiculous paper by some Israeli authors saying that Israel has no more duty to vaccinate Palestinians than England has to vaccinate Irish. And that, ironically, Israel has vaccinated more Arabs than any other Arab state. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1637.84s)]
*  And Gaza Strip, instead of investing in the military budget, Israeli critiquing Gaza of overspending on military, they should look for the health care system. So all of that is only being allowed to be celebrated. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1656.84s)]
*  It is exactly similar to what was looking like. You had similar pieces where apartheid South Africa was doing the same claims that Africans in apartheid South Africa have better outcomes health-wise than Africans in other countries. So the problem is not apartheid itself, but we should invest in South Africa or so on. So that's a point. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1672.84s)]
*  But another thing, before the dawn of limited self-government in Northern Ireland, Britain did have responsibility to vaccinate the Irish in Northern Ireland in the part of island that is still occupied. It absolutely did have a responsibility to do that. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1693.84s)]
*  So I wrote a response to that with an Irish lawyer. We hope it gets published. So we'll see how they do that. But on another point, Israel tried to be the leader in also vaccinating non-citizens. So it published that it will start vaccinating asylum seekers, refugees, so on, but not Palestinians. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1709.84s)]
*  So it would say, and it clearly said that by the Ministry of Health that it would vaccinate the, you know, you had these asylum seekers from Africa, not even like people without status. So refugees, asylum seekers, foreign workers, but not Palestinians. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1730.84s)]
*  And then later on, after a few appeals by human rights groups, it said, okay, so people who, Palestinian workers who work in the settlements or in Israel can get vaccinated, you know, but like I will vaccinate you only if I can exploit you, right? So you don't infect me. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1747.84s)]
*  So it's a very twisted really logic of like hierarchies of human value, basically, right? And also inside Israel, we need to know that the Palestinian citizens of Israel, who are 20%, have way less vaccination rate than the Jewish population, also due to lack of access to health care. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1767.84s)]
*  So where the vaccination center were stated in the beginning, now they're more spread out, but also because of lack of educating and hesitancy, right? So marginalized group really have mistrust in systems and medical systems. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1790.84s)]
*  They have vaccine hesitancy. We see it also in the black community in the U.S. where, you know, the more hardly-hit communities are more hesitant to get vaccinated. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1806.84s)]
*  Yeah, and in the UK too, black people, you know, a lot of people don't trust the authorities for, you know, historical reasons. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1818.84s)]
*  For good reason. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1825.84s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, absolutely. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1826.84s)]
*  So it's very interesting to hear that the same applies to Palestinian citizens of Israel. And I've heard within East Jerusalem as well. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1828.84s)]
*  As well. And of course, some of the communities are unrecognized. So if you look at the Nakaab desert, most of the, a lot of the Bedouin citizens in the Nakaab live in unauthorized and unrecognized villages where they don't have any health care infrastructure. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1837.84s)]
*  So, and instead of reaching out to them, you know, Israel doesn't do that. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1852.84s)]
*  Can I make a point? [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1857.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1860.84s)]
*  Because Osama points to, quite rightly, to the Lancet. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1861.84s)]
*  I think you'll find Osama, the Lancet specifically that has done this. And there is a very good reason for that. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1866.84s)]
*  The editor of the Lancet was put through the most gruelling, the cruelest kind of reactions from the Zionists, because he allowed, I know this story very well, it's very sad. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1874.84s)]
*  He allowed the publication of a letter decrying the 2014 assault on Gaza, signed by quite a number of doctors. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1892.84s)]
*  For that, the Israelis were after him. And he was invited to Israel, he was given the treatment. Since that time, he has been too intimidated, too intimidated to not to toe the line, because they got eventually to the publishers of the Lancet, who there was a threat to dismiss him from his. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1905.84s)]
*  So it's a very, it's an interesting that you mentioned that that, believe me, is the reason for why you saw that in the Lancet. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1932.84s)]
*  A few minutes left. You have to jump on another panel. So I just wanted to get your your final thoughts on the time right now and how critical it is for. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1942.84s)]
*  I can stay for a bit more. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1956.84s)]
*  Oh, okay, good. Good, good, good. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1958.84s)]
*  Yeah, if you could talk maybe about just like, yeah, how critical it is right now for international law to be followed in all aspects of, you know, Israel's colonialism, obviously, but but but specifically around around the vaccination program and we see, you know, in Gaza, just the [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1961.84s)]
*  The deliberate deterioration of the health care sector because of Israel's violence and colonialism. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1982.84s)]
*  How how have how do physicians, how are physicians even able to address COVID under, you know, the confinement of Gaza right now. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=1992.84s)]
*  So I've had the opportunity to work also in health care in Israel and the West Bank and in Gaza to volunteer in mobile clinic and the West Bank and Gaza, so I can kind of have an image. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2004.84s)]
*  And I think in the occupied Palestinian territory, we need to remember we haven't seen the pandemic started later. I think we still we haven't seen the peak of it. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2017.84s)]
*  By now, and if the in the beginning, people were really careful and really the PA did and Hamas did a good job in trying to curb the numbers. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2028.84s)]
*  But you know, the economical situation is so hard that you can simply and people cannot, these are not jobs that people are working from home with the internet and so on. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2036.84s)]
*  And the schools are not equipped with the also all the digital equipment. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2046.84s)]
*  So we haven't seen the peak. I think of the pandemic also stay ahead much later than it did in the in the US and in Israel. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2053.84s)]
*  And we need to remember to a protective factors like they are paradoxically the Palestinian population is way younger than the Israeli or general Western population. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2063.84s)]
*  And we know that COVID hits much more or kills much more elderly population that might explain why the numbers are yet, you know, not that a catastrophic. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2073.84s)]
*  But still, if we do, we need to do age adjustment to the Israelis and that it doesn't have nursery houses. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2084.84s)]
*  So we say, you know, elderly residences. So while and that was some of the hot spots in New York and in other Western cities. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2090.84s)]
*  So I definitely think we haven't seen the worst. The worst is yet to come. We can see it with an alarming number of positive tests coming. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2100.84s)]
*  Although you have a limited number of testing, testing is quite highly positive. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2107.84s)]
*  So it's very and it's a much more morbid society. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2114.84s)]
*  Society, you know, if we if in the US people are always talking about pre existing condition in Palestine, we can generally talk about occupation as a pre existing condition that makes the entire community has much more diabetes and hypertension and heart diseases and lots of other much more higher percentage of smoking. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2121.84s)]
*  So it's practically very virtually impossible to practice a healthy lifestyle if you are living in a refugee camp. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2141.84s)]
*  And of course, there's a class element if you're not wealthy and so on. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2148.84s)]
*  So I think we might see an alarming number in the future in the near future. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2152.84s)]
*  And that's why it's very urgent to to try to get the vaccine. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2157.84s)]
*  And we know that the vaccine vaccine Israel has more vaccination than than than it needs now. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2161.84s)]
*  And it's trying to to distribute vaccines based on these political alliances and political gains to Guatemala or Honduras or, you know, different countries. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2167.84s)]
*  And that is absolutely ridiculous. So it should be definitely held accountable. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2179.84s)]
*  Of course, each time each moment is precious and can think about any workers. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2186.84s)]
*  You're talking about communities that are large families in small houses in crowded cities with no health care infrastructure without a lot of abilities to a to do social distancing and without a water center without proper water sanitation and hygiene, especially in Gaza. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2192.84s)]
*  So you can't practice the preventive measures. You need the vaccination as quick as possible. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2212.84s)]
*  Yeah. And what are your thoughts on on where we go from here and how people listening to this or watching this are rightly outraged. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2219.84s)]
*  What what can can ordinary citizens do at this point? [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2232.84s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Good question. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2237.84s)]
*  And, you know, one would have thought that Israel had reached the bottom in terms of the outrageous things that it's done to the Palestinians. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2240.84s)]
*  But every time Israel takes me by surprise, there is still a new low to get to. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2254.84s)]
*  And my view is that this behavior over a pandemic, which has frightened the whole world, this behavior is so unconscionable that I would have thought that people should have been totally outraged by it. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2260.84s)]
*  And the fact that this outrage is not expressing itself, except by the usual suspect, is really very disheartening. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2284.84s)]
*  And that's all I can say. Nevertheless, nevertheless, we know what we're dealing with. We're dealing with a deeply criminal state. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2295.84s)]
*  And I never miss my words about this, because if you want to do something about it, you have to spell it out and you have to tell it like it is. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2305.84s)]
*  This is a deeply criminal state which should never be allowed to get away with this. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2316.84s)]
*  It's not only accountable, it's punishable. It has to be punished for the things that it's done. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2323.84s)]
*  Now, in order to to bring that about, it seems to me that people, first of all, have must let the scales fall from their eyes. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2330.84s)]
*  Every time Israel says anything or does anything, they must understand that this is a political act designed to boost the privileges of one particular group of people, Jewish people, at the expense of everybody else. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2340.84s)]
*  So they've got to understand that. That is what motivates Israel. Secondly, that it behaves above the law and outside the law, and that is not acceptable for any of us. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2354.84s)]
*  And thirdly, that the way to deal with all this has to be through action. It can't be through justice approval and talking and shouting. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2366.84s)]
*  And it's not going to work. You have to you have to act. And the purpose of acting is to make Israel into the outlaw that it is recognized by the whole world. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2378.84s)]
*  It has to be made into a pariah exactly as happened with South Africa. Great model for us to follow. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2391.84s)]
*  And I'm very happy to say we already are because we have a thriving, successful BDS movement, Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2398.84s)]
*  And I urge everybody who wants to do something to start off at least with joining the movement and working hard for that and every other way they can think to publicize, [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2407.84s)]
*  expose this criminal state for what it is they should consider with all the representatives of authority of government at their disposal. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2419.84s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. I think that's a perfect way to end this discussion. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2432.84s)]
*  I am so grateful for the work that you both do. Dr. Khadda Karmie, physician, writer, author, scholar, and Dr. Osama Tanous, physician, pediatrician, and public health writer and scholar as well. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCfQtKOMAEM&t=2443.84s)]
