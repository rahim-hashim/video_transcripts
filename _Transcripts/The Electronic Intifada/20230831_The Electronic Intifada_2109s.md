# How Palestine's baseball team made history | EI Podcast
**The Electronic Intifada:** [August 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk)
*  One day the siege will end and the baseball as well as all sorts of other sports and activities [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=0.0s)]
*  will be much easier for folks in Gaza to participate. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=19.2s)]
*  Welcome back to the Electronic Intifada Podcast. I'm Nora Barrows-Freedman. Today we're taking [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=24.96s)]
*  a look at both the cultural boycott of Israel and how Palestinian baseball players are trying [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=45.24s)]
*  to make a place for themselves on the world stage. Joining us today is Robert Ross. He's a professor [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=50.32s)]
*  at Point Park University and the author of The Great Baseball Revolt, The Rise and Fall of the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  1890 Players League. He also wrote a fantastic feature for us in March entitled Call to Boycott [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=62.16s)]
*  Team Israel at World Baseball Classic. Bob, it's so great to have you with us on the Electronic [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=69.52s)]
*  Intifada Podcast. Thanks. It's an honor and pleasure to be with you here. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=74.72s)]
*  It's a nice way to talk about everything that we talk about on EI and also sports at the same time, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=79.6s)]
*  which I know many of our audience doesn't hear about on EI frequently. So I think this will be [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=89.28s)]
*  a really fun episode. You interviewed several players for Team Palestine and we have some video [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=96.24s)]
*  clips of them talking about baseball under occupation and restrictions and some video [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=104.16s)]
*  of players in Gaza playing baseball coming up in a few minutes. But first I want to have you talk [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=108.88s)]
*  about the cultural boycott calls that happened during the World Baseball Classic in terms of [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=114.56s)]
*  the Israeli team, which I should mention Puerto Rico wiped the floor with them on March 13th [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=119.44s)]
*  during their game. It was a combined eight inning perfect game by the Puerto Rican team [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  with a walk off and a 10 to zero score. I guess that's the next best thing to a full boycott of [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=131.12s)]
*  the team. In the piece you wrote for us that quote, backed financially by the Jewish National Fund, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=136.64000000000001s)]
*  the team serves as a distraction from the human rights abuses and massacres the state and many [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  of its citizens have been carrying out for several decades now, the boycott advocates argue. The [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  latest official roster for Team Israel indicates that only one of its players was born in the [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=156.16s)]
*  Middle East. The rest are Americans going out of their way to play for an apartheid state. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  And the New York Times also did a splashy story on the Israeli team, of course, portraying it [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=166.24s)]
*  as an underdog scrappy. They even use the term David and Goliath team with players quote, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=171.76s)]
*  connecting with their Jewish heritage. Can you talk about the sports washing that happened last [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=178.16s)]
*  month at the World Baseball Classic and the call by Palestinian civil society and Palestinian [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=183.28s)]
*  athletes to boycott the team? Sure. I think as all your listeners know, this year has been [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=188.24s)]
*  particularly brutal for Palestinians. And from day one, Palestinians have been killed, particularly [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=195.76s)]
*  in the occupied West Bank, more at a more rapid rate than I think since the second Intifada. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=205.04s)]
*  And with the new openly racist, unapologetically racist militant right wing government of Israel, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=212.4s)]
*  we've just seen this escalation of all of the sorts of tactics of the occupation, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=221.68s)]
*  ethnic cleansing that have been going on for decades. And of course, that continues to this [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=226.4s)]
*  day. It was just before we started talking, I was reading about the attacks at Al Aqsa. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  And so amidst all of this, we have this baseball team, Team Israel playing in the World Baseball [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=237.11999999999998s)]
*  Classic on an international stage. And as you said, they've been portrayed in the media and [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=243.6s)]
*  they portray themselves as this underdog, as this great little story. These American players [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=248.64s)]
*  connecting to the Jewish heritage and sort of this conflation of, you know, as Israel often does and [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=254.0s)]
*  as Zionists often do this false conflation between Judaism and Zionism that, you know, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=262.32s)]
*  representing Israel is really one in the same as representing one's Jewishness. And I don't know [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=269.04s)]
*  any of those players personally, and I was not able to speak to any of them. And I don't know [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=277.44s)]
*  if they know what Israel is doing. They should. But they nonetheless represent this brutal apartheid [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=282.08s)]
*  racist nation state. And so Palestinians, whom I've talked to, called for a boycott of [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=291.44s)]
*  Team Israel. And this is in line with the ongoing cultural and sports boycott. PACBI, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=301.6s)]
*  the Palestinians for Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel, have been calling on for what? Almost [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=307.76s)]
*  20 years now to boycott institutions that normalize the oppression and the exploitation and [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=313.12s)]
*  ethnic cleansing occupation of Palestinians. And so Team Israel is no different than, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=325.92s)]
*  you know, the Israeli National Ballet or an Israeli National Orchestra that is sent around the world [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=332.8s)]
*  really in a manner that normalizes Israel as if it's a normal nation state like any other [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=340.64000000000004s)]
*  and not a sort of rogue state that is committing all sorts of human rights abuses. And so [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=348.48s)]
*  I spoke with folks from PACBI about this and their call was quite clear and simple to boycott [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=356.32s)]
*  to boycott Team Israel and to ask the organizers of the World Baseball Classic to [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=364.32s)]
*  exclude Israel from the tournament. Of course, that didn't happen. But I think it did, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=370.71999999999997s)]
*  at least the conversation was out there. And there are a lot of, there are actually a lot of [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=376.64s)]
*  sort of progressive lefty baseball fans out there. That's not the majority, but I think more so than [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=382.71999999999997s)]
*  a lot of sports. And so I think hopefully at least this conversation started among folks who, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=387.6s)]
*  you know, like me are huge baseball fans, but also don't want to support human rights abuses. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=393.84000000000003s)]
*  Right. Right. And on the other hand, we have the Palestine team, which didn't play in the World [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=400.64000000000004s)]
*  Baseball Classic, but did have a chance to play in the West Asia Cup, where they came in second [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=406.72s)]
*  place, they got silver. Tell us about the makeup of the Palestine baseball team, how they built [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=412.0s)]
*  the roster and what baseball looks like under apartheid occupation and displacement. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=417.92s)]
*  Sure. I discovered the existence of the Palestine national baseball team as I was researching for [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=424.16s)]
*  the article about the call to boycott. I did not know that such a team existed. And it's in part [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=431.76s)]
*  because they were just formed recently. This was their first international tournament, the West [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=438.08000000000004s)]
*  Asia Cup, and it was formed by a bunch of guys, Palestinians in exile, mostly in the United States, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=444.64s)]
*  a lot around the Chicago area, but also some players from Gaza. Baseball is actually a small, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=453.76s)]
*  but growing sport in Gaza. There are some folks in Gaza who just for whatever reason, really wanted [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=460.56s)]
*  to learn to play and have improvised and men and women in Gaza have been playing baseball for almost [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=465.68s)]
*  five years now. And so the team consists of, I think, five players from Gaza and I want to say [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=472.56s)]
*  18 or 20 from who are Palestinians who are based in the United States. Some are college players, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=481.2s)]
*  some are a couple of minor league players, a few former college minor league players, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=487.2s)]
*  but really good, legitimate baseball players who just kind of surprised the international baseball [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=492.72s)]
*  community by doing so well at the West Asia Cup. These teams are not bad teams. Pakistan has been [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=502.32s)]
*  good for quite some time. Nepal has a good team. India has a good team. And Palestine came in second, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=509.84s)]
*  lost to Pakistan in the final and really put up some good quality baseball. And I just found it so [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=517.6s)]
*  exciting that Palestine had a team and it was such a thrill and an honor to speak with [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=526.0s)]
*  some of the players from the team. And I just was so impressed by how proud they were to represent [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=533.6800000000001s)]
*  Palestine and also how proud they were as baseball players. They take their craft really seriously [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=540.16s)]
*  and they're proud that they did so well on the international stage. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=545.12s)]
*  In one of the clips that we'll go to up first, the player talks about how uniforms were donated [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=551.6800000000001s)]
*  by various NGOs, including PCRF, the Palestine Children's Relief Fund. I'm just struck by how [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=563.0400000000001s)]
*  I'm sure the siege that has been in place for now 16, almost 16, 17 years on Gaza has probably made [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=574.0s)]
*  it really difficult for players to get uniforms and equipment and also just the space. What does [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=585.6s)]
*  playing baseball look like in Gaza? That's a good question. It looks like a lot of fun. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=598.16s)]
*  Men and women, boys and girls have been playing baseball, like I said, for about five years [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=610.0799999999999s)]
*  in Gaza and having a lot of fun with it. But often if you look at some of the video clips, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=615.12s)]
*  they don't have bats and so they hit the ball with their hand and they catch the ball with [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=621.76s)]
*  their hands and they run around the bases just like any other baseball player. Some folks recently [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=627.44s)]
*  have had access to bats and gloves and of course the space is limited. They often play on soccer [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=636.32s)]
*  fields in Gaza, but there are not baseball diamonds cut out like we have in North America. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=643.44s)]
*  It's a small but growing sport and people are tenacious about it. People in Gaza are about [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=655.36s)]
*  everything and they're still managing to play baseball despite being under siege, despite not [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=661.6s)]
*  having access to equipment or to spacious fields or much less electricity at night to play during [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=669.12s)]
*  the evenings. It's really inspiring to see. I'm speaking from North America where [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=679.04s)]
*  kids here have literally thousands of dollars in resources to play baseball at various levels. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=690.56s)]
*  It's great to see that the kids are still really persevering through that and hopefully [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=701.4399999999999s)]
*  one day the siege will end and the baseball as well as all sorts of other sports and activities [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=708.88s)]
*  will be much easier for folks in Gaza to participate in. Bob, let's go to our first clip. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=717.4399999999999s)]
*  First we're going to hear from Tarek Suboh who hit the first ever home run for the Palestine team [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=726.3199999999999s)]
*  during an international game. If you want to talk a little bit about Tarek and the significance of [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=731.84s)]
*  his home run and then we'll go to the clip. Tarek is a catcher for Team Palestine. He has played [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=742.5600000000001s)]
*  organized baseball for most of his life. He currently lives in northwest Indiana near Chicago. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=751.0400000000001s)]
*  I'll let him speak for himself but he obviously took so much pride in this home run, the first [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=761.9200000000001s)]
*  home run by anyone in Palestinian organized baseball history. As you'll hear he describes [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=767.6800000000001s)]
*  the bat and the pitch in quite detail. It was a big jolt for the whole team and for all of [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=778.48s)]
*  the Palestinians and folks in solidarity who were watching at the time. It seemed like it was a form [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=786.88s)]
*  of activism in a sense. A lot of people don't think that we should even exist and we saw a lot [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=794.72s)]
*  of hate online and the trolls and stuff like that and whatnot but we also felt a sense of pride and [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=800.56s)]
*  duty to Palestine and Palestinians and we put a lot of smiles on a lot of people's faces. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=807.92s)]
*  Baseball is a very very grassroot stage in the Middle East in general [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=814.4s)]
*  so not everybody understands our sport but they understand that we were having success [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=822.64s)]
*  so I think a lot of people took pride in that fact. For us it was bittersweet but overall it was very [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=827.84s)]
*  positive and warming that we were able to do that. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=834.4000000000001s)]
*  I understand some of the guys on the team are from Gaza and you have folks across the U.S. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=843.44s)]
*  What was it like to bring everyone together? I imagine that was the first time you guys were all [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=849.44s)]
*  together? It was the first time that everyone was together. It's funny that you asked that. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=854.1600000000001s)]
*  I mean it's so again the majority of the team is from the states which makes sense. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=858.16s)]
*  There's not baseballs rampant running through the streets of Palestine but with the Gaza guys it [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=864.8s)]
*  was a really cool experience. They got to see baseball from a different level than they're [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=871.8399999999999s)]
*  used to. They're used to just kind of playing. Gaza was introduced baseball in 2017 [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=876.7199999999999s)]
*  by a group of players that were on our team actually. They're used to kind of playing [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=884.0s)]
*  with each other and it's very beginner level baseball and then they came to Pakistan and we [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=892.1600000000001s)]
*  met up with them and I think that they realized like wow okay we're actually these guys are pretty [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=898.8000000000001s)]
*  good so it was really nice to show them like hey there are Palestinians out there in the world [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=903.5200000000001s)]
*  there in the world that can play baseball at a high level and it was just kind of nice [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=911.12s)]
*  sharing the field with guys that have never truly seen high level baseball like that [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=919.12s)]
*  and hopefully that that will turn into inspiration for them and to bring home to Gaza [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=924.72s)]
*  that like hey you know what this is a serious sport and we can compete in baseball for years to come [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=933.12s)]
*  and hopefully that my hopes that it is inspires a you know a spark of the youth playing baseball in [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=938.0799999999999s)]
*  Palestine. Yeah that's awesome. Could you take me back to that the home run? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=943.76s)]
*  Do you remember what kind of pitch it was? Yeah I remember that very well. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=951.36s)]
*  Really just focusing on his command. I mean just following through with his curveball. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=957.4399999999999s)]
*  I mean his curveball is bread and butter right now and there it is right there. Oh that's a shot. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=960.8s)]
*  Tarek Sabour with a shot to the right to center field to left field excuse me it's over the fence [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=964.24s)]
*  that is the first Palestine home run of the tournament it's a two run jack for T-Rex [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=969.52s)]
*  Tarek Sabour and that is a huge shot and that is going to make him rethink his off-speed pitches [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=974.8s)]
*  don't you think? Well when you hang him you bang him like that and now it was one heck of a hit [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=982.5600000000001s)]
*  to left field he sat back on that ball and just took it where he could and put it over the left [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=986.0s)]
*  field fence what a sweet swing there by Palestine to take a big commanding lead that was a huge [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=990.64s)]
*  So he threw me a first pitch splitter which was pretty nasty I'm not gonna lie I was like okay [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=997.36s)]
*  that's a good pitch I followed it off and when he threw me that I'm like okay like he's gonna [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1002.16s)]
*  throw me some jumps so like I really need to like sit back and see it come all the way in and you [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1007.04s)]
*  know make sure I'm not swinging out of my pants and he threw me a curveball right after that which [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1012.64s)]
*  he probably should have stayed splitter because it was a really good pitch and he threw me a [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1017.68s)]
*  curveball and it hung up and I saw it all the way in and as soon as I hit it I knew I mean I've [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1022.4s)]
*  played a lot of baseball in my life and you kind of know when you like get enough of one yeah so [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1027.04s)]
*  I hit it and I was just watching it it hung up forever and the guy seemed like he was about [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1032.8799999999999s)]
*  to park under it I'm like is he really gonna catch this ball like there's no way that this is not [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1039.6799999999998s)]
*  leading the yard but no I saw it go over the fence everyone went wild I was really happy for [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1043.6s)]
*  my teammates honestly because they were they got super excited yeah when I'm rounding the bases [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1050.6399999999999s)]
*  again I'm thinking like man I hope my family was watching like yeah I knew my wife was unlikely [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1055.6s)]
*  for her to stay up because we got two young babies so I'm like you know at least my parents or some [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1061.12s)]
*  of my cousins and my brother or something you know somebody luckily I got a ton of messages and stuff [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1067.36s)]
*  after the game like saying like wow amazing that was great and then it was kind of went all over [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1072.32s)]
*  social media too and yeah to be the first ever to hit the first home run ever in Palestinian [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1076.0s)]
*  international baseball history is definitely something that I'm going to hang my head on it's [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1084.32s)]
*  one of my proudest home runs for sure. That was Tarek Zuboh speaking with our guest Bob Ross. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1090.0s)]
*  Let's hear from another player Nadir Ahmed who's also in Chicago and was a contributor to the [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1096.32s)]
*  Electronic Intifada. What position does Nadir play? Nadir is what we would call a utility player. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1100.64s)]
*  He plays he can play just about any position, plays in the infield, plays in the outfield, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1108.48s)]
*  excuse me also has been playing organized baseball for most of his life and he in addition to coming [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1114.48s)]
*  off the bench and playing for for Team Palestine in this tournament he also did some play-by-play. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1123.6000000000001s)]
*  This was a grassroots effort and so there's you can go on YouTube and watch these the whole [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1129.0400000000002s)]
*  videos of all the games and some of the games Tarek is or sorry Nadir is doing the play-by-play [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1135.3600000000001s)]
*  announcing as well. I don't know the exact you know exactly what they went through but from what [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1142.5600000000002s)]
*  what they described they were you know they had to stay in a room that was like the way he described [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1148.24s)]
*  it we took like this small bus everywhere in Pakistan and Ahmed Tawfish said we would we stay [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1154.32s)]
*  in a room that's like basically smaller than this bus for five days to get here and then to go back [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1160.32s)]
*  they'll have to stay three days to get back in a small room like that so they definitely had a tough [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1167.52s)]
*  journey getting there and and I commend them because they've been playing baseball for only [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1173.6s)]
*  you know five six years out there you know like I guess there was there's like pictures of [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1179.44s)]
*  Palestinians playing baseball like back in the 40s and 50s but really like nothing concrete has [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1185.04s)]
*  been really established there until most recently yeah and it's mostly in Gaza which is wild to me [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1192.96s)]
*  and they barely have any like you know place to play or equipment one of our teammates [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1201.1200000000001s)]
*  which was Steve Sosob who runs PCRF he went out there shortly before the tournament and dropped [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1208.0s)]
*  off like donations that we had that people had collected for them like you know bats and gloves [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1217.1999999999998s)]
*  and balls and stuff like that so really the cool thing about them coming out here despite their [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1223.28s)]
*  inexperience in playing the game is they got to learn from guys that have been playing their entire [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1230.3999999999999s)]
*  lives you know whether it was you know like seeing how you know we keep score or you know a lot of [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1234.96s)]
*  the guys too you know it's competitive baseball so even me I got two at bats I played two endings [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1243.52s)]
*  throughout the tournament so it's very competitive yeah so you know I think some of the Gaza guys [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1250.88s)]
*  only had like one at bat and like one time on the field or whatever yeah and they were in the [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1256.0s)]
*  beginning like why am I not playing but when they got their opportunity and they saw the speed of [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1261.2s)]
*  the game they were like oh I have a lot to learn so it was good to get them that experience so they [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1266.0800000000002s)]
*  realized oh this is a whole new level of baseball we have a lot more training to do and you know a [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1271.6000000000001s)]
*  lot of guys too are motivated and hopefully you know doing camps out there you know just to get [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1277.68s)]
*  the game growing even more you know yeah that's awesome so once you all got to practice stand [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1283.3600000000001s)]
*  together as a team what was that like like the joy of playing together and putting on the Palestine [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1289.68s)]
*  jersey like what did that feel like I mean to be honest we were the joy was there everybody was [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1294.8s)]
*  excited especially like seeing guys from Gaza show up like that that put a motivation in everybody [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1302.0s)]
*  but really it didn't sink in with the guys to be honest with you until after our first game or two [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1309.2s)]
*  really guys really more worried competitive guys you know worried about am I going to play [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1314.72s)]
*  how many endings am I going to play how many bats am I going to get this is just a competitive [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1319.44s)]
*  nature of athletes you know sure sure but once the game started getting started rolling and these [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1322.88s)]
*  games were live streamed and we'd get pictures from Gaza the west bank the US videos of people [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1328.8s)]
*  watching us then it set in then you had guys go oh now I really got to play hard I don't care who [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1335.28s)]

*  my endings played or anything like that as long as we got the w and the people back home were just [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1348.4s)]
*  like super it just blew our minds that they were watching baseball yeah yeah I bet I bet I mean [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1352.4s)]
*  it was also like just the timing you know for for you all to be playing together as team Palestine [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1361.92s)]
*  emits like the massacres in Janine and oh yeah what's happening like that must have been just [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1368.5600000000002s)]

*  suffering really bad me personally you know it was tough like just focusing on a game a silly game [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1388.5600000000002s)]
*  when your people are constantly just being berated with bad news after bad news after bad news death [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1396.4s)]
*  after death after death it was definitely to be honest for me it was rough like I didn't really [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1403.76s)]
*  ask my teammates how they felt but they mentioned it you know they mentioned like like even before [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1409.76s)]
*  games like uh you know Steve gave a very before our first game Steve gave this very impassioned [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1414.08s)]
*  like passionate speech about how about like the three prisoners who escaped the prisoners [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1420.0s)]
*  who escaped with a spoon you know and it was like yo they can escape with a spoon we could [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1425.12s)]
*  defeat anybody with these bats you know like it was just like I don't I'm just paraphrasing but [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1429.68s)]
*  man like I wish I was recording because I had been recording the entire thing and sometimes guys said [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1435.04s)]
*  some very uh passionate things that that just missed the camera and uh but man that that fired [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1440.4s)]
*  up everybody on the team that before our first game and then we went out there and we thrashed [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1446.0s)]
*  uh Nepal 21 to 1 and then we shut out the defending champions Sri Lanka 10-0 and then we destroyed [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1450.48s)]
*  Bangladesh 14-3 in the semi-finals and then we just made too many mistakes in the finals [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1459.04s)]
*  yeah yeah and everybody has an update you know we we sent out our our our best pitcher who shut down [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1464.72s)]
*  Sri Lanka you know there were just a few errors made in the first inning that we didn't really [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1471.12s)]
*  bounce back up from we didn't execute the same way we were at the at the plate you know like the [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1476.0s)]
*  first couple games guys were very aggressive at the plate swinging at first strikes driving it up [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1482.0s)]
*  the middle getting a lot of hits and then the finals for whatever reason uh I don't know maybe [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1487.6s)]
*  after getting down a couple runs people got tight but it's just we just we didn't score any runs I [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1493.84s)]
*  think it's only the seventh or eighth inning which you can't you're not going to really win much [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1499.6799999999998s)]
*  baseball games if you take if you go two-thirds of the game without scoring and Nadir also talked [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1504.08s)]
*  about the Israeli team in the sports washing um that is happening around promotion of of the [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1509.6s)]
*  Israeli team as as part of brand Israel let's go to that clip so for folks like baseball fans who [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1517.12s)]
*  might not really know much about Palestine or anything if they tune into the world baseball [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1523.1999999999998s)]
*  classic and they see team Israel like what what would you want them to know and um what would you [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1529.9199999999998s)]
*  say to folks who maybe were planning to to go to a game or or whatever like I would say like what [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1536.2399999999998s)]
*  I told my teammates if if for whatever reason we were in the same tournament as them we'd boycott [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1542.8s)]
*  that game um it's just it's it's whitewashing they you know and sports washing is actually the [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1548.8799999999999s)]

*  that yet and I can guarantee you is that I know I know the the talent that we have on this team and [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1826.6399999999999s)]

*  Morocco and like we don't we don't have that much of a like a platform like they did for us [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1843.3600000000001s)]

*  it's like there were there was so many biasness going on even during the World Cup and it's just [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1861.3600000000001s)]
*  everything in the world around the World Cup time was a lot of like different opinions about [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1867.52s)]
*  different things and even right now it's still like that but just being able to let Morocco [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1874.16s)]
*  showing them a little love the same way they show us although we're still small the one day [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdz38d9NwKk&t=1880.0s)]
