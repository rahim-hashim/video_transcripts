Video Description: Across the US, students and faculty are continuing to resist repressive measures by university administrations intended to stifle or even criminalize speech in support of Palestinian rights, as the genocide in Gaza continues.
Along with elite US institutions calling riot cops on their own students who have been holding sit-in protests, or attempting to prevent students from holding protests altogether, some universities have tried to categorize the political ideology of Zionism as a protected identity class in order to define anti-Zionist speech as racist hate speech.
‚ÄúAs long as I‚Äôve been a teacher, I‚Äôve been teaching about Palestine ‚Äì it‚Äôs always been either central or integrated into the work that I do,‚Äù Maura Finkelstein told The Electronic Intifada Podcast.
Finkelstein, a scholar of anthropology and a writer, taught at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pennsylvania for nine years.
She had been teaching a course on the anthropology of Palestine, a class that she says had been approved by the college.
But even though she was tenured, she was fired in May 2024 over her social media posts in support of Palestinian rights and against the political ideology of Zionism ‚Äì a move that has been seen as a warning to other anti-genocide professors.
The firing followed months of targeted harassment by Israel lobby groups and individuals who pressured the university to fire Finkelstein, accusing her of ‚ÄúJew hatred‚Äù over her anti-Zionist principles. Finkelstein is Jewish.

# Jewish professor fired for anti-Zionist posts, with Maura Finkelstein | EI Podcast
**The Electronic Intifada:** [November 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA)
*  Welcome back to the Electronic Intifada podcast. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Nora Barrows-Freedman. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  Across the US, students and faculty [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=4.58s)]
*  are continuing to resist repressive measures [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=7.36s)]

*  criminalize speech in support of Palestinian rights [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=14.68s)]
*  as this genocide continues. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=18.44s)]
*  As we've been reporting, along with elite US institutions [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=21.12s)]
*  calling the riot cops on their own students who [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=24.76s)]
*  have been holding sit-in protests or attempting [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=27.52s)]
*  to prevent students from holding protests altogether, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=30.68s)]
*  some universities have tried to categorize [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=33.44s)]
*  the political ideology of Zionism [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=36.16s)]
*  as a protected identity class in order [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=38.84s)]
*  to criminalize anti-Zionist speech as racist hate speech. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=41.4s)]
*  Joining us to talk about all of this is Nora Finkelstein. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  Nora is a scholar and was a professor of anthropology [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=49.0s)]
*  for nine years at Mullenberg College [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=52.16s)]
*  in Allentown, Pennsylvania. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=54.64s)]
*  Even though she was tenured, she was fired earlier this year [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=56.76s)]
*  over her social media posts in support of Palestinian rights [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=60.48s)]
*  and against Zionism, a move that has been seen as a warning [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=64.64s)]
*  to other anti-genocide professors [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=68.8s)]
*  in this expanding McCarthyist atmosphere in US higher [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=70.92s)]
*  education. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=75.2s)]
*  Nora, it's so good to have you with us on the Electronic [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=76.36s)]
*  Intifada podcast. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=78.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=80.44s)]
*  It's such an honor to be here. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  I really appreciated the work that you all have done so much. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=82.4s)]
*  It's been really meaningful. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=85.96s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=87.67999999999999s)]
*  I appreciate that. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=88.47999999999999s)]
*  Well, The Intercept first published a lengthy article [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=90.32s)]
*  in late September detailing what happened to you. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=94.96s)]
*  And they reported that your firing over social media posts [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  quote, followed months long efforts aimed [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=101.32s)]
*  at pressuring the college to remove you [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=104.6s)]
*  with online crusaders, with online crusades primarily led [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=107.72s)]
*  by anonymous Mullenberg alumni. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=112.11999999999999s)]
*  Nora, give us an overview of what happened in May, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=115.24s)]
*  but also what led up to your firing [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=118.44s)]
*  and the enormous amount of vitriol and harassment [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=120.36s)]
*  directed at you for your anti-Zionist political beliefs. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=123.08s)]
*  You were, as is the norm, called an anti-Semite. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=126.72s)]
*  You were accused of Jew hatred despite the fact [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=129.84s)]
*  that you're self-Jewish, but that never [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=132.4s)]
*  seems to really matter when it comes to these attacks [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=134.72s)]
*  and the people behind them. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=137.0s)]
*  What happened? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=138.56s)]
*  Yeah, thanks so much for that. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=140.6s)]
*  So it is, I'll preface though what happened over the past [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=142.08s)]
*  year by saying that as long as I've been a teacher, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=145.84s)]
*  I've been teaching about Palestine, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=149.52s)]
*  it's always been either central or integrated into the work [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=150.96s)]
*  that I do. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=154.8s)]
*  I'm a generalist anthropologist, so I'm always [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=155.36s)]
*  looking for examples of scholarship [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=157.8s)]
*  to illuminate the lessons I'm teaching in my classroom. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=160.68s)]
*  So for years at Mullenberg, I had [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=163.8s)]
*  been teaching a class on Palestine. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=167.76000000000002s)]
*  It was specifically the anthropology of Palestine [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=169.84s)]
*  had been approved by the college. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=172.16s)]
*  I was incorporating units on Palestine in all of my classes, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=173.88s)]
*  teaching Palestinian scholars and scholars of Palestine. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=178.8s)]
*  And I even was supported by my institution financially [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=182.04s)]
*  and emotionally and intellectually [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=185.76s)]
*  to go to Palestine one summer. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=188.52s)]
*  I needed my institution to pay for the plane ticket [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=191.32s)]
*  to go along with the fellowship I received. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=193.68s)]
*  And they were happy to do it because I [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=195.32s)]
*  had won a fellowship. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=196.36s)]
*  So all of this is to say that our institutions support us [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=197.24s)]
*  when they want to, and that's conditional. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=200.44s)]
*  So I was doing what I always do in September and early October [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=203.60000000000002s)]
*  of last year. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=208.96s)]
*  I had two classes. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=211.0s)]
*  I was teaching about Palestine in both of those classes [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=212.44s)]
*  and had actually already completed [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=215.84s)]
*  my units on Palestine. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=217.44s)]
*  And so the only responsible thing [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=219.16000000000003s)]
*  I could do as a teacher and a scholar after October 7 [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=221.60000000000002s)]
*  is help my students understand and contextualize [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=224.48s)]
*  what was being classified as an event as something [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=227.35999999999999s)]
*  within the longer history of settler colonial [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=232.04s)]
*  occupation and genocide we had already learned about. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=234.56s)]
*  And so I did that. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=237.39999999999998s)]
*  And that sort of started a series of events [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=238.2s)]
*  that involved one student who was taking both my classes, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=243.48s)]
*  filing a complaint, and later filing an OCR complaint. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=247.72s)]
*  And it also involved word getting out [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=253.32s)]
*  through my social media and through other spaces [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=257.44s)]
*  that alumni had access to that I was an anti-Zionist, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=259.71999999999997s)]
*  that I was teaching about Palestine. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=263.12s)]
*  And a petition was drawn up that was calling me [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  a Hamas supporter, which was based on nothing. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=268.84s)]
*  Whatever that means, it's another conversation, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=273.56s)]
*  but was based on me being an anti-Zionist [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=275.48s)]
*  and standing in support with Palestinian liberation. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=280.24s)]
*  And there was a lot of talk on the internet [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=284.08s)]
*  about how my very existence made Jewish students feel unsafe. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=286.40000000000003s)]
*  So I had this one student who filed a complaint [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=289.72s)]
*  and later withdrew it. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=293.40000000000003s)]
*  There were 16 students at Hillel International [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=295.12s)]
*  who, unfortunately, my department shares [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=298.6s)]
*  a building with Hillel. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=301.56s)]
*  So we were actually in the same space. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=302.84000000000003s)]
*  They filed a complaint that because of my social media, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=305.92s)]
*  I made them feel unsafe. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=308.72s)]
*  And we can talk about the language and weaponization [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=310.0s)]
*  of unsafety in addition to anti-Semitism. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=312.40000000000003s)]
*  And all of this, there was also attention [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=315.76000000000005s)]
*  drawn to my publications. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=318.16s)]
*  I wrote an essay called Never Again Means Never [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=319.76000000000005s)]
*  Again for Anyone, in which I was accused of being a Holocaust [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=322.48s)]
*  denier because I felt as though we should be [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=325.40000000000003s)]
*  standing against all genocide. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=328.92s)]
*  And so this just involved a lot of surveillance [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=332.0s)]
*  of my teaching, my scholarship, my publications [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=334.40000000000003s)]
*  by my institution, in which it felt [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=337.6s)]
*  as though the administration was looking for a space [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=340.04s)]
*  to push into. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=345.6s)]
*  And all of this sort of went quiet over the winter break. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=347.16s)]
*  And then on January 17, I was notified [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=350.16s)]
*  by the provost of the first day of the semester [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=353.40000000000003s)]
*  that there was an OCR complaint against me, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=355.84000000000003s)]
*  against Mealambor College naming me. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=358.92s)]
*  And a few days later, I was placed on administrative leave [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=361.16s)]
*  because of one, what I learned was one of the eight [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=365.72s)]
*  complaints, which was from a student I have never met, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=369.08000000000004s)]
*  still to this day, I've never met her. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=373.24s)]
*  I knew the student existed because the student had been [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=375.52000000000004s)]
*  surveilling my social media for months at that point. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=380.04s)]
*  But the student filed a complaint [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=383.96000000000004s)]
*  in which they claimed that the social media post, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=389.68s)]
*  which was a repost of something where I'm Meekhanazi, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=392.68s)]
*  a Palestinian poet wrote, that was about not normalizing [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=395.48s)]
*  Zionism, that because the student identified as a Zionist [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=398.36s)]
*  and because the student believed that Zionism [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=401.96s)]
*  and Judaism were the same, that I was violating [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=403.64s)]
*  the equal opportunity nondiscrimination policy [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=406.12s)]
*  that essentially would be denying the student access [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=409.08s)]
*  to an education, because even though the student [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=412.28s)]
*  did not know me and had never taken my class, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=414.44s)]
*  the student assumed from the social media post [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=416.44s)]
*  that they would not be safe in my class. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=418.72s)]
*  It went through a three and a half months investigation. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=421.08s)]
*  It went through various faculty, staff [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=426.44s)]
*  and administrative panels. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=430.16s)]
*  And I was told that I was terminated for cause, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=433.6s)]
*  which is like immediately no access to severance. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=437.2s)]
*  Your behavior is so egregious that pending an appeal, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=439.44s)]
*  you're done. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=443.64s)]
*  And just to make clear, the OCR is the Office [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=445.64s)]
*  for Civil Rights at the Department of Education. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=448.56s)]
*  So that's a federal complaint. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=451.15999999999997s)]
*  I mean, we've covered that for, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=452.6s)]
*  it seems like decades now, it probably, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=456.11999999999995s)]
*  it has been decades where Israel lobby groups [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=457.44s)]
*  habitually file complaints to the Office for Civil Rights [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=460.4s)]
*  at the DOE alleging that Jewish, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=465.44s)]
*  that some Jewish students' rights are being violated [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=470.0s)]
*  because of sometimes the mere presence [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=474.79999999999995s)]
*  of Palestine rights activity on campuses. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=477.55999999999995s)]
*  And as we know, most of these complaints [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=481.23999999999995s)]
*  sit around for a while, then they get tossed out. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=484.6s)]
*  There's no recrimination. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=488.12s)]
*  There's no post examination of these kinds of complaints, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=489.6s)]
*  but they just get kind of refiled and refiled and refiled [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=493.72s)]
*  as a way to instill a sort of self-censorship sort of [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=497.2s)]
*  on campuses by both students and faculty [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=504.96s)]
*  if they speak out on Palestine. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=507.48s)]
*  But anyway, yeah, go ahead. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=509.28s)]
*  Yeah, and I think what's important [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=510.52s)]
*  about what you're drawing attention to [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=511.84000000000003s)]
*  is with these OCR complaints. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=513.36s)]
*  So there were eight specific complaints against me, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=515.28s)]
*  five of which were anonymous complaints [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=518.64s)]
*  based on my social media. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=520.8000000000001s)]
*  They could have been filed by anyone. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=522.2s)]
*  They could have all been filed by the same person. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=524.36s)]
*  You don't actually have to be credibly attached [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=526.88s)]
*  to an institution or in relation to the person [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=530.6800000000001s)]
*  or group that you're filing a complaint against [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=533.8000000000001s)]
*  in order to do so. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=535.92s)]
*  So three of them were recognizable. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=537.2s)]
*  Two of them, by the time the OCR report was filed, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=539.9200000000001s)]
*  had already been investigated by the college [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=543.08s)]
*  and was found to be baseless. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=545.64s)]
*  And then the last one, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=547.6s)]
*  the equal opportunity complaint, that was the one. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=548.88s)]
*  And I think this is, we're seeing this more and more [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=551.9200000000001s)]
*  at NYU, at UCLA, across the country, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=555.0400000000001s)]
*  that this equation of Judaism and Zionism [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=558.34s)]
*  is finding its sort of like final collision [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=561.72s)]
*  in these equal opportunity complaints. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=568.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=571.2s)]
*  I mean, and this is after also decades [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=572.6800000000001s)]
*  of trying to codify the definition of antisemitism [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=576.5200000000001s)]
*  to mean criticism of the Israeli state, Israeli policies, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=580.9200000000001s)]
*  and Zionism as a political ideology. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=585.4200000000001s)]
*  And as you mentioned, like NYU, Barnard, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=589.5600000000001s)]
*  and now apparently, M√ºhlenberg have adopted [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=593.6s)]
*  this codification, this kind of like, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=599.5600000000001s)]
*  this collision, as you said, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=605.08s)]
*  with trying to really blend and make [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=606.5600000000001s)]
*  indistinguishable Judaism as a religion, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=615.76s)]
*  as a culture, as tradition with Zionism, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=618.76s)]
*  which is a very new political ideology [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=623.22s)]
*  predicated on ethno supremacy and genocide. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=626.1999999999999s)]
*  Can you talk, and it seems like what happened to you [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=631.7199999999999s)]
*  ultimately in May when they fired you, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=635.64s)]
*  and again, you're a tenured professor, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=640.8399999999999s)]
*  this is very rare that this happens, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=642.76s)]
*  was that this is maybe the first instance that we know of [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=645.0799999999999s)]
*  in the last 13 months where an anti-Zionist professor [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=650.0799999999999s)]
*  has been fired, a tenured professor has been fired [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=655.6s)]
*  over this really depraved codification of this attempt [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=659.92s)]
*  at marrying Judaism and Zionism as a protected identity. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=670.4s)]
*  Yeah, and I think there's so many different factors [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=675.36s)]
*  at play here. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=678.84s)]
*  Since October 7th, 2023, as far as the AAUP is aware, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=680.8s)]
*  I'm the first faculty member with tenure who's fired. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=686.8s)]
*  Of course, there were cases in the past, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=690.4799999999999s)]
*  Steve Salaita is one of the most well-known one, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=692.0s)]
*  but there are countless adjuncts visiting [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=694.5999999999999s)]
*  assistant professors, lecturers, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=699.4799999999999s)]
*  other contingent faculty who have lost their contracts, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=701.4799999999999s)]
*  who've lost their jobs, without the same kind of foundation [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=704.1999999999999s)]
*  that would cause outrage. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=709.12s)]
*  And also there is the fear of, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=710.32s)]
*  for folks who are being sanctioned now, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=715.0400000000001s)]
*  that if they go public with the story, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=716.76s)]
*  they'll never work in higher ed again. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=718.2s)]
*  And I think that that's a real threat. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=719.9200000000001s)]
*  We've seen that happen before. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=721.24s)]
*  And with my case, I think it sort of crystallizes [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=723.48s)]
*  at least two of the big crises in higher ed right now. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=727.88s)]
*  One is the fact that particularly at a private college [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=732.1600000000001s)]
*  like my own, but any college or university [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=735.2s)]
*  across the country, the constant erosion of federal funding, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=737.56s)]
*  of federal support has created these institutions [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=740.8s)]
*  so that they're completely or almost completely dependent [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=743.4399999999999s)]
*  on tuition and donor support. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=746.76s)]
*  And so if you've created this financial model [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=749.28s)]
*  in which this isn't actually about education, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=752.76s)]
*  this is about the accumulation of resources, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=755.6s)]
*  you have administrators who are in a position [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=758.96s)]
*  in which they don't know what Judaism is, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=761.52s)]
*  they don't know what Zionism is. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=763.3199999999999s)]
*  They probably actually don't know much [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=764.96s)]
*  about the decisions they're making. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=767.96s)]
*  What they do know is if they alienate their financial base, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=769.6800000000001s)]
*  they will collapse. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=774.0400000000001s)]
*  And so in my case, there was the petition, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=775.96s)]
*  there were emails, there were robo calls [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=780.24s)]
*  that were coming in like a hundred a minute [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=782.6s)]
*  to administrators, to Pennsylvania politicians, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=785.64s)]
*  the mayor of Allentown demanding that I be fired, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=790.2s)]
*  this kind of pressure on an institution [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=793.4s)]
*  that is dependent on this financial backing [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=796.04s)]
*  is a lot of pressure. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=800.04s)]
*  Not that I'm defending the administrators, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=802.36s)]
*  but it's existing within this financial crisis [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=805.28s)]
*  that has already existed. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=808.64s)]
*  And then on the other hand, you have Zionists [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=810.24s)]
*  who are partnering with right-wing white supremacist groups [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=812.24s)]
*  that have been attacking DEI, affirmative action, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=815.9599999999999s)]
*  critical race theory, gender studies. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=820.68s)]
*  Jews who identify as Zionists are partnering [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=824.52s)]
*  with these very anti-Semitic sort of political [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=828.2399999999999s)]
*  and economic bodies that are using them [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=833.8s)]
*  to undermine equity initiatives on campus. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=836.3199999999999s)]
*  And this is sort of part of a larger playbook [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=839.7199999999999s)]
*  that we've been seeing for decades. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=841.56s)]
*  And so this sort of perfect collision made it so that [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=843.0799999999999s)]
*  I believe that my college felt as though [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=847.52s)]
*  they were in the position in which they would rather [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=853.28s)]
*  betray the integrity of higher education [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=856.8s)]
*  and what the institution is actually about [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=860.28s)]
*  in order to preserve the economic support [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=862.84s)]
*  that they felt they needed in this landscape [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=866.1999999999999s)]
*  in order to survive. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=868.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's really clear. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=869.92s)]
*  It's really clear. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=872.04s)]
*  Can you talk a little bit about the investigation [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=874.22s)]
*  as much as you can or want to into you? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=879.9s)]
*  I mean, it's several hundred pages. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=882.4200000000001s)]
*  It was very, very detailed. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=885.58s)]
*  The fact that, as you said, they don't know the intricacies [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=887.02s)]
*  of this very stark difference between Judaism and Zionism. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=892.1800000000001s)]
*  And yet they were picking apart every social media post [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=897.9s)]
*  that you had made within a certain time span [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=902.1s)]
*  and getting testimonies from people. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=906.7s)]
*  I mean, they spent a lot of time and resources [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=908.4200000000001s)]
*  investigating your scholarship and your personality. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=911.66s)]
*  Can you talk a little bit about that process [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=917.22s)]
*  and how that was for you? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=919.58s)]
*  Well, it wasn't fun. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=925.62s)]
*  I'll say that. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=928.7s)]
*  It was a really weird process in large part [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=930.3s)]
*  because what we're seeing with so many of these cases, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=933.62s)]
*  it's a Title VI investigation. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=936.3399999999999s)]
*  But at schools like Muhlenberg, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=939.2199999999999s)]
*  I'm not sure if this is different at large universities, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=941.5799999999999s)]
*  but at institutions like Muhlenberg Small Colleges, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=944.2199999999999s)]
*  Title VI is held within the Title IX office. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=949.8199999999999s)]
*  They operate together and are overseen by the same person. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=952.92s)]
*  And we know from all kinds of stories about sexual harassment [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=955.86s)]
*  and assault on campuses across the country [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=962.26s)]
*  that Title IX is not always looking out [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=964.98s)]
*  for members of the community. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=968.42s)]
*  They're more looking out for the interests [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=971.34s)]
*  of the institution. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=973.34s)]
*  And what I learned through that process is that there is, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=975.14s)]
*  we talk about academic freedom as academics [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=980.66s)]
*  as though we understand what that means [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=983.14s)]
*  until all of a sudden we're faced with the reality [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=986.62s)]
*  of trying to explain and determine [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=988.38s)]
*  what we're actually protected by. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=990.94s)]
*  And what I learned through that process is that one, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=993.02s)]
*  at a private college, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=996.34s)]
*  you actually don't have academic freedom, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=997.1800000000001s)]
*  not in any legal sense. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=998.82s)]
*  And I think even at public universities, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1000.62s)]
*  that's being eroded every day. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1003.1800000000001s)]
*  But with these kinds of equal opportunity cases, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1005.54s)]
*  they're lifted out of the policies and procedures [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1008.82s)]
*  that are laid out for faculty in the faculty handbook. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1012.26s)]
*  And they're put in a very secretive [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1016.5s)]
*  and very opaque Title IX process, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1019.34s)]
*  which I think the most devastating thing about that process [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1022.58s)]
*  is that absolutely everything [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1026.02s)]
*  was marked personal and confidential. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1028.22s)]
*  And so I'm on a small campus. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1030.94s)]
*  And if I would share with my department colleagues [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1033.94s)]
*  what was going on, because no one, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1038.78s)]
*  none of the faculty staff or students [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1041.42s)]
*  were told anything about what was happening to me. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1042.94s)]
*  And if I would share anything, even the most vague details, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1045.9s)]
*  somehow a day later I would get an email [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1049.1000000000001s)]
*  from the Title IX lawyer reminding me [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1051.9s)]
*  that this is a confidential procedure [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1054.98s)]
*  and I'm not allowed to speak about it with anyone. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1057.1000000000001s)]
*  And so the college really created an environment [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1059.66s)]
*  in which in the best case scenario, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1063.0600000000002s)]
*  my colleagues wouldn't know what was happening to me [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1068.22s)]
*  and wouldn't have the information that they needed [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1071.74s)]
*  in order to act. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1075.6599999999999s)]
*  I did believe that I was able to talk about [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1076.7s)]
*  what was happening to me. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1079.3s)]
*  And so I did talk with trusted colleagues. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1080.26s)]
*  And what I found is that a lot of my colleagues [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1084.26s)]
*  wanted to believe in the administration [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1088.86s)]
*  and in the policies that were being laid out, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1091.02s)]
*  because to not do so was to realize [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1095.22s)]
*  that they were working for an institution [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1097.7s)]
*  that did not have their best interest in mind. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1099.38s)]
*  I think a lot of your listeners would never think [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1101.1000000000001s)]
*  that an institution would have their best interest in mind, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1103.82s)]
*  but higher ed is a weird place. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1106.3s)]
*  And so it really created this environment [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1109.38s)]
*  in which I was pretty isolated [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1113.14s)]
*  and didn't really feel as though I could move [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1115.8600000000001s)]
*  out of that isolation until I started connecting [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1118.94s)]
*  with other faculty across the country [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1121.14s)]
*  who were going through similar things. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1122.78s)]
*  Jadaliyah was a really incredible resource [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1124.74s)]
*  of drawing together through some of their programming [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1127.38s)]
*  scholars who were being targeted for Palestinian liberation [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1131.06s)]
*  and anti-Zionist speech. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1136.5s)]
*  And so that was a really wonderful way to realize [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1138.1s)]
*  that this is just part of a playbook [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1140.98s)]
*  that we're seeing across the country. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1143.14s)]
*  But the procedure itself was really isolating. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1144.86s)]
*  It was really confusing. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1148.7s)]
*  And it resulted in sort of very liberal investigators [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1150.34s)]
*  and administrators who knew nothing about Palestine, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1159.1s)]
*  who know nothing that's going on aside from what [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1161.62s)]
*  our political leaders and corporate media tell us, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1163.8999999999999s)]
*  sort of determining that I was an antisemitic monster [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1168.1799999999998s)]
*  because of the sort of things about me [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1173.1s)]
*  that actually make me a good anthropologist. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1176.54s)]
*  I question power, I question institutions, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1180.26s)]
*  I question empire and settler colonialism. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1183.98s)]
*  That's actually kind of inherent [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1186.74s)]
*  to what I think a good anthropologist should be doing. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1188.1s)]
*  But I was told that doing anything controversial, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1191.7s)]
*  making students feel unsafe because they're uncomfortable, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1194.5s)]
*  mixing up that language was actually against the project [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1197.94s)]
*  of the liberal arts, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1201.66s)]
*  which I always thought was about critical thinking. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1202.54s)]
*  So all of this is to say it was very isolating [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1204.46s)]
*  and it resulted in administrators basically telling me [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1206.3799999999999s)]
*  that because of my extramural speech on social media, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1213.4599999999998s)]
*  I was unfit to be around young people, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1219.78s)]
*  which is a pretty wild leap to make. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1223.72s)]
*  Yeah, no kidding. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1227.1799999999998s)]
*  I wanna go back to something that you mentioned, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1229.34s)]
*  this whole concept of safety and what makes students [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1233.26s)]
*  of a certain political persuasion, i.e. pro-genocide, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1239.1s)]
*  feel quote unquote safe and how that's been weaponized [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1243.06s)]
*  on college campuses for a while now [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1246.54s)]
*  in terms of a way to shut movements down, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1252.46s)]
*  shut professors down, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1257.72s)]
*  make Palestine not only a toxic subject to teach about, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1260.24s)]
*  but potentially a danger to one's career. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1269.6s)]
*  Can you talk a little bit about that [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1275.32s)]
*  and how you see the weaponization of something [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1276.96s)]
*  that should be, I don't know, very protected? [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1281.6799999999998s)]
*  I mean, real safety, right? [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1286.76s)]
*  Real safety when it comes to students, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1288.32s)]
*  when we think about whose safety is more valued than others [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1290.24s)]
*  and what the term means and how it's been used as a cudgel [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1296.1599999999999s)]
*  in order to completely incapacitate its very meaning. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1301.56s)]
*  Yeah, so I was at New York for nine years, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1308.58s)]
*  I was an adjunct for three years. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1312.24s)]
*  So I was teaching for 12 years [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1314.46s)]
*  and the entirety of my career as a professor [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1316.08s)]
*  sort of existed under the shadow of trigger warnings. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1320.3999999999999s)]
*  And what I learned to liberal arts colleges [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1324.08s)]
*  throughout my career is that the students [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1327.24s)]
*  who are most vulnerable and most unsafe in the classroom [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1329.3999999999999s)]
*  are not the ones who are calling for safety [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1333.52s)]
*  and trigger warnings and whatnot. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1337.32s)]
*  It's students who have probably never felt [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1338.8999999999999s)]
*  uncomfortable before and who have never had [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1342.44s)]
*  to question their worldview, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1345.68s)]
*  which I firmly believe is what you're in college to do. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1347.0s)]
*  You're not at college to learn what you already know. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1351.92s)]
*  We're here to learn what we don't yet know. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1354.6000000000001s)]
*  And we're all doing it together. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1357.3200000000002s)]
*  And that has become such a threat [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1358.68s)]
*  because we have this language of safety [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1360.64s)]
*  and trigger warnings and whatnot. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1363.92s)]
*  I used to tell my students way before this [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1365.8400000000001s)]
*  that everything I teach is a trigger warning. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1367.8400000000001s)]
*  I can't anticipate what is going to make my students [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1370.88s)]
*  feel uncomfortable, but I hope that everything we learn [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1375.1200000000001s)]
*  about makes them feel uncomfortable [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1377.48s)]
*  because the world is an uncomfortable place. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1379.3600000000001s)]
*  And so I've been very, very dismayed to see the way [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1381.72s)]
*  in which this weaponization of unsafety is, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1385.0800000000002s)]
*  first of all, coming from the far right, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1389.88s)]
*  which I thought were like anti-snowflake, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1392.2800000000002s)]
*  but now they'll use it. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1395.1200000000001s)]
*  They'll use it if it works. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1399.28s)]
*  But we can think about how the university [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1401.56s)]
*  has never been a safe space for many people. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1404.76s)]
*  And it's an incredibly hierarchical institution [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1407.1599999999999s)]
*  that's built on the ashes of indigenous genocide [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1410.6399999999999s)]
*  and the transatlantic slave trade. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1414.9199999999998s)]
*  And many, many people are not truly safe [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1416.32s)]
*  at these institutions. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1421.84s)]
*  We know that that's true. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1423.08s)]
*  And so the question of whose safety [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1424.36s)]
*  is being taken seriously during the time [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1426.68s)]
*  in which I was being told [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1429.1200000000001s)]
*  that I was making certain students feel unsafe, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1430.0400000000002s)]
*  I was also not just watching across the country [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1432.5600000000002s)]
*  as Arab, Muslim, Palestinian students [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1436.6000000000001s)]
*  were actually being physically targeted [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1439.6000000000001s)]
*  and experiencing actual violence, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1442.8400000000001s)]
*  but I was also hearing it from the few students [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1445.8400000000001s)]
*  on my campus when it's a predominantly white institution. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1448.3600000000001s)]
*  But I would hear from my students who were Palestinian [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1451.2800000000002s)]
*  and Arab and Muslim, students of color, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1456.92s)]
*  that they really felt scared. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1458.64s)]
*  They felt actually scared to be on campus [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1460.16s)]
*  and to talk about their own experiences. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1462.5600000000002s)]
*  And when we talk about student safety [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1465.1200000000001s)]
*  on this sort of like larger national level, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1467.48s)]
*  we're never talking about those students. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1469.0400000000002s)]
*  We're talking about a sort of imagined Jewish, [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1470.44s)]
*  Zionist, racialized white student who supports genocide [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1476.6000000000001s)]
*  and wants to be able to do so freely [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1480.8000000000002s)]
*  without being made to feel bad about it. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1482.6000000000001s)]
*  And after I was barred from campus in January, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1484.8s)]
*  then I was watching student encampments around the country [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1490.4399999999998s)]
*  in which college presidents were calling the NYPD [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1493.8799999999999s)]
*  and other militarized police departments [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1497.76s)]
*  on their anti-Zionist students [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1500.0s)]
*  who were fighting for Palestinian liberation. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1502.28s)]
*  That seems pretty unsafe to me, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1505.08s)]
*  but this notion of feelings has really been weaponized [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1507.12s)]
*  to shut down any conversation [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1510.04s)]
*  in support of Palestinian liberation [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1512.72s)]
*  while also completely erasing the real material [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1514.6000000000001s)]
*  and safety of anti-Zionist students in the United States [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1517.68s)]
*  to say nothing of the hundreds of thousands [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1523.6000000000001s)]
*  of Palestinian students who've been killed [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1525.64s)]
*  by Israel's genocidal attacks on Gaza. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1528.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1531.72s)]
*  What about, you mentioned that you were able to find [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1533.64s)]
*  little pockets of support in some of your colleagues [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1539.64s)]
*  on campus, but was there much of a campaign [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1543.68s)]
*  in support of you that was visible, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1551.8000000000002s)]
*  that was helping you fight the administration [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1553.88s)]
*  throughout this process? [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1556.8600000000001s)]
*  What kind, or did people kind of cower behind their desks, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1559.48s)]
*  so to speak, because they feared for their own jobs? [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1564.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I wanna be careful [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1568.64s)]
*  about the way I talk about my colleagues [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1570.1200000000001s)]
*  because I think since the Intercepts article broke, [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1572.0600000000002s)]
*  there's been a complete shift on campus. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1575.64s)]
*  And I've always had the allies that I knew [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1577.7800000000002s)]
*  were on the same page with me. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1580.76s)]
*  This was a small group, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1583.0s)]
*  but I always knew that they were there. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1584.0400000000002s)]
*  But I also think we don't like to talk about higher ed [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1585.64s)]
*  through the language of class struggle, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1590.0400000000002s)]
*  but we have these institutions that are, first of all, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1591.92s)]
*  academics, there are no jobs anymore. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1597.16s)]
*  And so for the jobs that are not even good jobs, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1600.6000000000001s)]
*  you have hundreds of people [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1604.16s)]
*  who are trying to get these jobs. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1605.0s)]
*  There's always this sense that we're in competition [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1606.24s)]
*  with each other and that we're disposable and replaceable. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1608.98s)]
*  And I think, Muenberg really crystallized that [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1612.1200000000001s)]
*  in the sense that morale had been low with faculty [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1616.3200000000002s)]
*  and staff for years to a devastating degree. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1620.3600000000001s)]
*  I think the administration had really, [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1623.16s)]
*  because of financial crisis that was even before COVID, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1625.06s)]
*  I think the faculty in particular [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1628.94s)]
*  had really been made to feel, [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1631.12s)]
*  especially faculty and the humanities and social sciences, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1632.58s)]
*  that not only were we all replaceable, [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1635.5s)]
*  but our departments were in danger of being downsized [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1637.32s)]
*  or collapsed into others. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1641.78s)]
*  And so I think even before the fall of last year, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1646.26s)]
*  it was really hard to get faculty to do anything [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1651.1s)]
*  other than do their job right in front of them [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1653.7s)]
*  because that fear of drawing attention to oneself [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1656.38s)]
*  could actually risk one's job and evidence of that. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1659.14s)]
*  And so I think within that environment, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1663.42s)]
*  it's really hard to have any kind of solidarity. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1665.3s)]
*  I think people are just really scared. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1668.8600000000001s)]
*  My college doesn't pay particularly well. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1672.1000000000001s)]
*  It's a pretty terrible economy. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1674.78s)]
*  I think people were just overwhelmed and scared. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1677.98s)]
*  I do think, I don't believe in silver linings [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1680.5s)]
*  and it's a genocide, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1684.1000000000001s)]
*  but I do think one of the things that has been at least [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1685.46s)]
*  a small source of comfort is that at least on campuses, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1690.42s)]
*  I've been involved in Palestinian liberation work [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1695.1200000000001s)]
*  since 2003 when I was a master's student at Columbia. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1697.3s)]
*  And I've never seen a global movement [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1700.8s)]
*  in support of Palestinian liberation like I do now. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1705.72s)]
*  And I think a lot of that is not enough, [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1708.78s)]
*  but a lot of that is happening [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1710.94s)]
*  on college and university campuses. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1712.14s)]
*  And there are so many faculty [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1714.02s)]
*  who are protecting their students and encampments [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1716.22s)]
*  who are putting their neck out on their line [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1719.3s)]
*  to push for divestment, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1721.76s)]
*  who are challenging administrators who are going to actions. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1722.94s)]
*  And so, while maybe it's hard to find [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1726.6200000000001s)]
*  at our individual institutions, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1729.42s)]
*  I do think that there's a movement [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1731.38s)]
*  that I couldn't imagine five years ago [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1734.6200000000001s)]
*  that we're seeing now, unfortunately, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1737.6200000000001s)]
*  our political leaders and our university [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1740.6200000000001s)]
*  and college leaders are Zionists or they're cowards. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1743.14s)]
*  And so we're seeing pretty devastating policies, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1747.14s)]
*  but in terms of solidarity, I wish it was bigger [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1750.66s)]
*  and also it's bigger than I ever could have imagined. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1754.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, indeed. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1758.7800000000002s)]
*  And yeah, the tenacity of these students who are, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1759.6599999999999s)]
*  but yeah, the administrations keep calling the cops [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1762.6599999999999s)]
*  and they keep coming back. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1767.6599999999999s)]
*  And it's not just in the US, [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1770.9799999999998s)]
*  but across North America, in Europe, [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1773.02s)]
*  it's pretty remarkable. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1777.2199999999998s)]
*  And yeah, I wanted to, [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1778.58s)]
*  I think it's a really important thing [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1784.54s)]
*  yeah, I wanted to kind of ask about [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1788.54s)]
*  what your options are at this point. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1791.54s)]
*  I mean, are you pursuing any legal cases? [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1794.06s)]
*  Do you even want to get your job back at Muenberg [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1800.26s)]
*  after the way that they treated you [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1803.62s)]
*  and denigrated your scholarship [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1805.86s)]
*  and the reason why anthropology [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1808.6s)]
*  even exists in the first place? [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1811.46s)]
*  What are the next steps for you? [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1814.74s)]
*  Yeah, so I would like the choice. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1817.86s)]
*  And I also think, we're in appeals [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1822.46s)]
*  and I'm really hoping that because it is a faculty panel, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1825.22s)]
*  I'm really hoping that the faculty will see that, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1829.5s)]
*  regardless of what you think about me, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1833.54s)]
*  I'm pretty insignificant when it really comes down to it. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1835.98s)]
*  If you don't have to like me, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1839.06s)]
*  you don't have to support my work, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1840.06s)]
*  but this sets a really terrifying precedent. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1841.1s)]
*  And I'm really hoping that the faculty will see [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1844.78s)]
*  that and they will go against the provost's decision. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1848.5s)]
*  And then it would go to the president [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1853.66s)]
*  and who knows from there, [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1856.46s)]
*  but I'm hoping that at least on the level of faculty, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1857.3s)]
*  I see a different move than the various processes [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1860.38s)]
*  that have happened so far. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1865.14s)]
*  In terms of the future, I think that for me, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1867.18s)]
*  it's about doing the work. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1872.02s)]
*  And I think that the classroom, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1874.34s)]
*  I think the university or the college [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1875.86s)]
*  is one place to do the work. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1878.5s)]
*  I don't think it's the only place to do the work. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1879.78s)]
*  And it's a really terrifying time to imagine [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1881.9399999999998s)]
*  both the present and future of academia [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1886.02s)]
*  and higher ed in the United States. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1888.34s)]
*  I mean, I feel like every week [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1891.1799999999998s)]
*  I hear from a new faculty member, [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1892.86s)]
*  either someone I know or a stranger who reaches out [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1894.62s)]
*  or is connected to me through mutual friends, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1897.1399999999999s)]
*  who's being sanctioned, suspended, threatened. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1900.06s)]
*  And what does it mean to work in environment like that? [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1903.04s)]
*  What are our jobs as educators [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1908.32s)]
*  if we cannot teach about the world? [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1910.96s)]
*  And I'm pretty narrow visioned right now, [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1913.68s)]
*  but I mean, there is nothing that I can imagine [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1918.6399999999999s)]
*  talking or thinking about [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1921.36s)]
*  that isn't beginning and ending with Palestine right now [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1922.56s)]
*  and isn't beginning and ending with a genocide [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1925.12s)]
*  that we're funding that I've seen so many, [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1927.3999999999999s)]
*  comrades in the 24th hour get on board [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1933.92s)]
*  with the Harris campaign and thinking about, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1937.52s)]
*  no matter what happens tomorrow, [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1940.04s)]
*  funding a genocide continues to be in our future. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1944.68s)]
*  And if we can't talk about that, [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1947.72s)]
*  if we can't push against that, [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1949.1599999999999s)]
*  if we can't organize against that, [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1950.24s)]
*  if we can't teach against that, [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1951.56s)]
*  then I don't know what the college or university is. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1953.04s)]
*  I feel very scared and pessimistic [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1956.24s)]
*  about the future of higher ed in this country right now. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1960.8s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1965.68s)]
*  Right, and as we were saying, [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1967.32s)]
*  I mean, this could be seen as like the first shot [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1968.72s)]
*  across the bow in terms of like open season [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1973.0s)]
*  on tenured professors teaching, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1976.32s)]
*  God forbid about the world, like you said, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1979.52s)]
*  and understanding things in this global context [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1982.68s)]
*  and in this context of imperialism and capitalism [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1987.0s)]
*  and how Palestine, as you said, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1991.72s)]
*  we have to talk about it as the beginning [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1995.28s)]
*  and the end of all of these social machinations. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=1998.1200000000001s)]
*  Everything that we see going on here in the US [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2005.4s)]
*  is directly related to what's happening in Palestine. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2009.4s)]
*  And yeah, I mean, what is the say [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2012.44s)]
*  about academia itself, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2018.28s)]
*  about even the study, the field of anthropology, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2022.44s)]
*  if it's being watered down, [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2027.56s)]
*  if it's being kind of eviscerated [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2030.2s)]
*  of its purpose in higher education? [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2032.8400000000001s)]
*  I mean, what kinds of conversations are you having [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2036.72s)]
*  with yourself and with your colleagues and friends [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2041.04s)]
*  about what this means for higher ed in general? [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2044.04s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, one of the, there's so many, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2051.08s)]
*  I mean, one of the big questions that is coming up, [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2053.2799999999997s)]
*  especially for faculty who teach at large universities [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2059.24s)]
*  in which they may have a class with 10 or 30 students, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2064.2799999999997s)]
*  they might also have a class with 300 students. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2068.74s)]
*  And I think, we can't trust the classroom. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2071.24s)]
*  We, I had the benefit for a long time [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2075.4799999999996s)]
*  of teaching at small liberal arts college [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2078.64s)]
*  in which I felt like I was really building relationships [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2081.08s)]
*  with my students. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2083.4399999999996s)]
*  Clearly, there are limits to that project. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2084.9599999999996s)]
*  But I also think that the idea of going into a classroom [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2089.08s)]
*  and knowing that your students could be recording you, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2093.3599999999997s)]
*  they could be working with faculty staff administrators [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2097.08s)]
*  who are trying to get faculty on record [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2104.52s)]
*  who are talking about Palestine. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2107.08s)]
*  I mean, I haven't said too much about this yet, [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2108.42s)]
*  but I was fired because of work that was being done [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2110.36s)]
*  by Hillel International. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2114.3199999999997s)]
*  The student who filed the complaint [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2115.74s)]
*  was a leader in Hillel International [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2118.0s)]
*  and was supported by the two staff members who did that work. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2120.96s)]
*  And we're really seeing, [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2124.08s)]
*  for people who've been paying attention, [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2127.2s)]
*  we've seen this for a really long time, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2128.6s)]
*  but Hillel International has really presented itself [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2130.16s)]
*  as the space for Jewish life on campus. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2132.72s)]
*  And perhaps that was true 50 years ago, [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2135.3199999999997s)]
*  but now Hillel is very explicitly a Zionist organization. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2137.68s)]
*  Their website says that Israel is the center of their work. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2141.56s)]
*  They are often the space in which students [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2144.5s)]
*  are getting radicalized through like Hezbollah fellowships [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2150.04s)]
*  or birthright. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2153.4s)]
*  A lot of the students that I was aware of at Nuremberg [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2155.08s)]
*  moved to Israel after they graduated [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2159.32s)]
*  or they joined the Israeli military [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2161.56s)]
*  or they had their sights on that [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2163.7000000000003s)]
*  because of programming that Hillel International was doing. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2166.08s)]
*  And this sort of provides support for students [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2169.64s)]
*  to be targeting their professors, [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2172.36s)]
*  recording their professors, going after their professors [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2175.2400000000002s)]
*  to the point in which it is very scary [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2177.92s)]
*  for folks to go into the classroom [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2181.62s)]
*  and teach about this material [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2183.42s)]
*  because we don't know who's in our classrooms. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2185.2799999999997s)]
*  We don't know who's watching and listening. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2188.16s)]
*  And I think that the power of institutions like Hillel, [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2190.16s)]
*  the ways in which donor money is operating on campuses [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2193.54s)]
*  creates an environment in which I, you know, [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2197.2999999999997s)]
*  I on the one hand believe that the way to fight this [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2200.8199999999997s)]
*  is for everyone to be teaching about Palestine, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2204.62s)]
*  to have that be like a critical mass. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2207.12s)]
*  But I also understand that, you know, [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2209.18s)]
*  a lot of my colleagues, a lot of my friends, [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2212.5s)]
*  a lot of academics who are struggling to make, you know, [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2214.4199999999996s)]
*  this job work for them, they don't have the support [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2218.2999999999997s)]
*  that they need in order to lose their jobs. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2223.1s)]
*  You know, it might jeopardize their citizenship. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2225.54s)]
*  They might be supporting a family. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2227.7s)]
*  They might, you know, be in a situation in which like [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2229.06s)]
*  this job is making or breaking their existence. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2232.1s)]
*  And so I can't judge people who are scared [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2234.62s)]
*  because it really makes sense. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2237.8399999999997s)]
*  But I think, you know, from my perspective, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2240.1s)]
*  we all need to be talking about Palestine. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2241.3799999999997s)]
*  We all need to be teaching about Palestine [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2243.02s)]
*  because, you know, in an ideal world, they can't fire us all. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2245.1s)]
*  And this kind of solidarity work, [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2248.5s)]
*  I think is really necessary. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2250.66s)]
*  And I can't really imagine that happening [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2252.54s)]
*  in a country like the United States. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2254.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2256.8599999999997s)]
*  Maybe one day. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2259.7s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2261.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2262.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2266.62s)]
*  I, you know, kind of finally, I wanna ask you about [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2267.46s)]
*  advice that you have for other professors, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2272.58s)]
*  tenured or adjunct or, you know, contract, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2275.54s)]
*  but also students who are watching what's happened to you [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2279.5s)]
*  and Steve Saleta and so many professors and academics [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2285.14s)]
*  and scholars over the years, students who, you know, [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2290.3399999999997s)]
*  have been suspended or put on academic probation [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2295.5s)]
*  for attending a protest. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2298.98s)]
*  What's your advice as someone who has been [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2302.74s)]
*  through that process and has been fired [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2306.14s)]
*  over your, you know, political, moral, ethical stance? [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2310.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2315.8599999999997s)]
*  So this may seem like a detour, but I was really lucky. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2316.7s)]
*  I had some incredible teachers when I was in high school [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2320.5s)]
*  that were sort of non-traditional, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2323.66s)]
*  even at a public high school like my own. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2325.66s)]
*  And one of them was this really incredible, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2327.58s)]
*  I mean, you know, probably complicated, [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2331.4199999999996s)]
*  but really incredible anarchist, vegan, [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2333.3399999999997s)]
*  Washington Post reporter named Coleman McCarthy [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2337.22s)]
*  who taught this class called Peace Studies. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2340.54s)]
*  And he really taught me so much. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2343.38s)]
*  I mean, when I was 16 years old, [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2347.7400000000002s)]
*  he was taking me to Lockheed Martin on the weekends [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2349.26s)]
*  to protest. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2352.38s)]
*  He was teaching me about these connections. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2353.44s)]
*  He was really incredible. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2355.42s)]
*  He also didn't always stop at red lights, [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2357.3s)]
*  which was an interesting lesson for a teenager like me. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2359.6800000000003s)]
*  But he told me, you know, when you're doing this work, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2363.78s)]
*  you have to be prepared for the loss that it will entail. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2366.54s)]
*  Like we never get rewarded for this work, [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2370.12s)]
*  at least not by those with power. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2373.4s)]
*  We do by our communities. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2375.1s)]
*  We do through our, you know, collective connections, [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2376.56s)]
*  but we, you know, there will always be loss [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2379.96s)]
*  associated with this work. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2383.12s)]
*  We do not get rewarded for challenging power. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2385.08s)]
*  And I think, you know, I am seeing students [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2387.72s)]
*  across the country who really understand this [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2390.3199999999997s)]
*  and really feel like the loss is worth it [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2393.4s)]
*  because what on earth are they inheriting? [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2396.92s)]
*  I mean, the world is such a disaster right now [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2399.7200000000003s)]
*  and these young people are inheriting it [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2403.56s)]
*  and they are imagining it otherwise. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2405.32s)]
*  They're imagining a better future. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2407.52s)]
*  And the only way that they're going to get it [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2409.2000000000003s)]
*  is by putting themselves on the line. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2411.28s)]
*  It's really been inspiring. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2412.82s)]
*  And I think a lot of my colleagues get that too, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2414.2400000000002s)]
*  that there is loss associated with this work. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2416.28s)]
*  But I think it's really important for us to think about [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2418.36s)]
*  what we have and what we can afford to lose [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2421.18s)]
*  and how we can show up with those understandings [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2424.7400000000002s)]
*  really clearly articulated to ourselves [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2427.7599999999998s)]
*  because I think there's so many different ways [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2430.08s)]
*  to be in the movement. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2432.2599999999998s)]
*  We don't all have to be doing the same kind of thing. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2433.3999999999996s)]
*  You know, I was just at University of Michigan [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2436.12s)]
*  talking to some incredible faculty and students [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2438.2s)]
*  and staff last week. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2440.72s)]
*  And, you know, one of the things that someone told me [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2442.3799999999997s)]
*  that I hadn't really thought about before, [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2445.08s)]
*  but, you know, they were saying, you know, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2447.08s)]
*  we're hearing about what happened to you. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2449.56s)]
*  We're thinking about all of the statutes [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2451.2s)]
*  that have been changed. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2452.8799999999997s)]
*  Like one thing that faculty can be doing right now [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2453.9599999999996s)]
*  is really getting clarity on the shifting procedures [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2457.28s)]
*  that are being used to target students, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2461.6400000000003s)]
*  target faculty and staff as well, [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2464.5s)]
*  to put pressure on institutions to be more transparent. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2466.52s)]
*  And there's ways to do that work [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2469.76s)]
*  without taking the kinds of risks [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2471.6400000000003s)]
*  that, you know, other people are doing [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2474.5600000000004s)]
*  that are more visible, that are more politicized. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2476.6600000000003s)]
*  I think there's so many different ways [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2479.0400000000004s)]
*  to be supporting this project. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2480.96s)]
*  And I think it's about having a real clarity [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2482.9s)]
*  over what you have, what you can lose [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2485.4s)]
*  and how to sort of use that information [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2488.36s)]
*  to get the keyed into being part of [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2492.86s)]
*  what is a growing movement invested [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2496.12s)]
*  in all kinds of liberation. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2499.64s)]
*  I mean, I think Palestine shines a mirror on empire. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2501.14s)]
*  And what we are seeing is the underbelly [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2504.92s)]
*  of so many aspects of, you know, liberal democracy [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2508.76s)]
*  that people have been turning their heads away [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2512.8s)]
*  from for a really, really long time [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2516.1600000000003s)]
*  and we can't do that anymore. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2517.0s)]
*  And so I think there's just so many different ways [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2518.44s)]
*  to, you know, use the skills and the tools [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2520.88s)]
*  and the sort of positions that we have [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2524.84s)]
*  to be involved and do the work. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2528.32s)]
*  But it also involves, you know, [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2529.92s)]
*  it always involves giving up something, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2531.32s)]
*  whether it be time or energy or job. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2533.0s)]
*  Yeah, there are many sacrifices [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2538.0800000000004s)]
*  and it is all important to, yeah, as you said, [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2544.08s)]
*  to find your place in the movement and keep going. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2548.3199999999997s)]
*  And I mean, I will say like, you know, [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2552.6s)]
*  I didn't have, you know, the best year, but I also, [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2554.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm in the United States. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2562.96s)]
*  I'm, you know, living what is a pretty safe [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2564.08s)]
*  and comfortable life. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2567.68s)]
*  I lost my job, but I actually haven't really lost that much. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2569.72s)]
*  And I think we just have to keep our eye on Gaza. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2573.9199999999996s)]
*  We have to keep our eye on the occupied West bank. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2576.68s)]
*  We have to keep our eye on Lebanon. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2578.6s)]
*  And remember that we owe Palestinians, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2580.52s)]
*  we owe folks in Lebanon, we owe folks [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2584.52s)]
*  who are actually being annihilated. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2587.24s)]
*  We owe them our attention. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2590.3999999999996s)]
*  We owe them our time. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2592.16s)]
*  We owe them our work. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2593.24s)]
*  I mean, this is, I think what it means [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2594.52s)]
*  to be a person who is paying attention, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2598.32s)]
*  to realize that, you know, we have sacrifices to make [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2601.1200000000003s)]
*  because, you know, at least here in the United States, [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2605.48s)]
*  everything that I have is the result of extraction [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2608.0800000000004s)]
*  and theft. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2611.7200000000003s)]
*  And, you know, I might not be directly involved in that, [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2612.84s)]
*  but we're living very comfortable lives in the US [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2616.28s)]
*  in comparison to people who are living through genocide. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2619.1200000000003s)]
*  So I keep that in mind when I think about the things [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2621.36s)]
*  that I've lost. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2623.4s)]
*  It's incredibly important. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2625.28s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2626.88s)]
*  Maura, where can people find your work? [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2628.96s)]
*  I spend far too much time on Twitter and Instagram. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2632.92s)]
*  So I'm there, I have a website. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xs8c1nh2tA&t=2639.96s)]
