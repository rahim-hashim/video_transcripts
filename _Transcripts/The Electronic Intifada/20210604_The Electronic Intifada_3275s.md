Video Description: On episode 39, Nora, Asa and Tamara discuss ongoing Silicon Valley tech censorship of Palestine-related speech.
We are joined by Omar Zahzah, a member of the US Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (USACBI) and the Palestinian Youth Movement, and Saliem Shehadeh, a graduate student at the University of California, Los Angeles.
In late April, Zoom, Facebook and YouTube blocked a live-streamed event featuring prominent activists from Palestine and South Africa.
They included Palestinian resistance icon Leila Khaled and Ronnie Kasrils, formerly a leading figure in the military wing of the African National Congress.
The University of California at Merced event, “Whose Narratives? What Free Speech for Palestine?,” was organized to discuss ongoing attacks on critics of Israel in academia and the dangers of censorship.
The event management platform Eventbrite also pulled the publicity page from its website.
“We are in a moment where profit-driven, private tech companies have taken it upon themselves to directly censor a classroom – and give themselves the authority to do that,” Zahzah says.
Earlier in April, Facebook deleted the entire account page of San Francisco State University’s Arab and Muslim Ethnicities and Diasporas (AMED) program, a co-sponsor of the event.
Facebook claimed that content posted to the event page violated its “community standards.”
Israel lobby organizations – and the Israeli government itself, through the Act.IL app it funds to harass and threaten university administrations – have tried to convince universities and the tech companies that hosting Khaled, who is in her seventies and lives in Jordan, would constitute “material support” to US-designated “terrorists.”
These groups have also waged a multi-year attack campaign against Rabab Abdulhadi, director of the AMED program.
“The attacks are not accidental – they are going after the AMED program, and they are going after Dr. Abdulhadi,” Shehadeh says.
“They’re going after her because of her Palestine advocacy work.”
Since the interview was recorded, just before Israel’s attacks on Gaza in May, Facebook has admitted to censoring the AMED page, saying it “indeed goes against our policies.”
Jewish Voice for Peace has organized an online action to demand that Facebook restore the AMED account.
Silicon Valley firms have won a number of lucrative contracts from the Israeli government and military in recent times.
Efforts to end the tech giants’ support for Israel have been stepped up in the last few weeks, following the attacks on the Gaza Strip and amid continuing settler-colonial violence in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem and inside Israel.
There have also been reports that many tech workers oppose doing business with Israel and have been mobilizing inside Silicon Valley corporations.
“What’s happening right now is a broader reckoning within the technology industry about its involvement in Israel,” an anonymous Google employee who is involved in organizing efforts at the company told Politico.

# Fighting censorship of Palestine with Omar Zahzah and Saliem Shehadeh | EI Podcast
**The Electronic Intifada:** [June 04, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g)
*  It's also about the erasure of Palestinian voices. It's also about the erasure of Palestinian [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=0.0s)]
*  stories. The complete deletion, right, of Palestine from the landmass, from the map, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=14.6s)]
*  and from ultimately the political imaginary. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  The electronic intifada. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=24.96s)]

*  Today on the Electronic Intifada Podcast, we're talking about what happened in late [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=40.44s)]
*  April when major tech companies yet again shut down an event featuring the Palestinian [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=44.72s)]
*  resistance icon Leila Khaled and others, this time at UC Merced. And the university has [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=49.8s)]
*  so far refused to challenge the censorship by these private corporations. We're joined [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=55.92s)]
*  today by Omar Zaza. They're a member of US ACPI, the US Campaign for the Academic and [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=61.2s)]
*  Cultural Boycott of Israel, and the Palestinian Youth Movement. And they've been following [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=67.24000000000001s)]
*  this issue for a while. Also with us is Saleem Shahadeh, a grad student at UCLA and a former [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=71.84s)]
*  student at San Francisco State. Omar and Saleem, thank you so much for being with us today [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=79.52000000000001s)]

*  Thank you for having us. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=88.04s)]
*  So bring us up to date on what happened in late April at UC Merced. Earlier, seven months [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=90.52s)]
*  ago in September of 2020, Zoom, YouTube and Facebook deleted and would not allow, you [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=99.60000000000001s)]
*  know, the pre-event page and then the event itself to go ahead. And this was an event [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=112.28s)]
*  with Leila Khaled, Ronnie Kastrules and other members of anti-apartheid activist movement [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=117.52s)]
*  scholars. Talk about what happened just, you know, a week or so ago and, you know, the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=124.03999999999999s)]
*  kind of the general atmosphere of like these Silicon Valley tech companies being able to [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=134.07999999999998s)]
*  censor events at public universities. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=140.04s)]
*  Yeah, thanks. Maybe Omar, I'll start here. So, yeah, so my connection to San Francisco [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=144.04s)]
*  State UCS, I graduated back in 2017, but I've stayed on board as part of the Arab and Muslim [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  Ethnicities and Diaspora program working with Dr. Abab Abdelhadi. So these, so the event [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=156.64s)]
*  the events that you're referencing started back in the fall. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=162.56s)]
*  They actually have an earlier history and I guess I've mentioned it briefly to get into how [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=170.0s)]
*  it formed is that there were a series of, we have a series of open classrooms under the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=176.96s)]
*  title of teaching Palestine at San Francisco State University in the AAMD program under [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=183.76000000000002s)]
*  Dr. Abdelhadi. So she incorporates it as part of the AAMD curriculum, as part of her [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=189.16s)]
*  scholarship and public advocacy and all these different works. And she collaborates as [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=193.32s)]
*  within the teaching Palestine project with other activists, scholars, you name it, right. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=199.32s)]
*  And one of these iterations was a joint program with Dr. Tomomi Kinakawa from Women and Gender [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=205.64s)]
*  Studies at San Francisco State University. And there were a series of events that were [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=212.84s)]
*  put together and the students absolutely loved it. So the event that was supposed to take place [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=217.48s)]
*  in September of 2020 was under the umbrella of critical women and gender studies mixing it with [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=225.23999999999998s)]
*  AAMD studies as part and parcel of like what AAMD studies does. And it wasn't the first [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=236.92s)]
*  collaboration they had done. They've done others in the past. This was the first that was targeted [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=241.72s)]
*  by the Zionist pressures and by the resulting huge tech companies. And kind of sick, what happened [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=246.84s)]
*  in the fall also happened last week where first we produced the flyer, we sent it out. There's [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=258.92s)]
*  noise being made about it. People are signing up. I believe in September we had over 1,500 [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=269.64s)]
*  people sign up before Zoom canceled the event. And what happened was a lot of these Zionist [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=274.20000000000005s)]
*  organizations started just smearing, just absolutely smearing the event, smearing Leila Khaled, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=285.16s)]
*  smearing Dr. Blahadi, smearing the AAMD program for putting it together. And they started writing [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=293.08000000000004s)]
*  letters to everybody, right. So they would send letters to San Francisco State. They would send [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=298.12s)]
*  letters to Zoom. They would send letters to Facebook. They would send letters to the [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=302.44s)]
*  congressional members. They would send letters to, you know, you name it. They were writing op-eds. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=305.96000000000004s)]
*  They were going all out. We ended up finding out that among one of the strategies they've taken is [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=311.16s)]
*  that there's this like, this app called Act IL. And essentially what it is, is it gets this huge [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=317.56s)]
*  database of people or huge listserv of people to, you just click a button and then it auto-sends [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=327.16s)]
*  whatever kind of- They call them missions. Yeah. Yeah. I believe there were, I think the last [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=333.72s)]
*  figure we saw on it was about 19,000 kind of active users engaged in the Leila Khaled event. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=340.44000000000005s)]
*  The Who's Narrative event. So 19,000 people on the Act IL website were sending in all these [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=350.28000000000003s)]
*  missions, as you said. And it had an impact, right. So what ended up happening first was Zoom's [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=357.40000000000003s)]
*  lawyers contacts, the CSU systems lawyers, and then it goes down the chain of command, if you will, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=365.40000000000003s)]
*  because, you know, these universities are corporate structures at this point, public or not, right. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=372.52s)]
*  And it goes to the provost of San Francisco State University, then sends a joint email to Dr. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=376.28s)]
*  Abdelhadi and Dr. Kinakawa. Actually, I don't know if it's the same email or in the same thread or [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=382.84s)]
*  two emails, but in any case, the provost sends the email informing them that Zoom's lawyers has [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=387.96s)]
*  contacted the CSU and informing them of the allegations of material support for terrorism [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=394.36s)]
*  and suggests that both of them seek legal counsel. Not that the university is going to provide the [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=401.4s)]
*  legal counsel, that they seek independent legal counsel. Okay, so multiple issues going on. One, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=406.36s)]
*  it's the fear tactic. It's the, you know, we're accusing you of material support for terrorism. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=411.88s)]
*  The second is you better lawyer up. And the third is we're not going to provide you that lawyer. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=418.12s)]
*  And so kind of then, you know, there's a large, the legal attacks against Palestine scholars and [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=423.16s)]
*  activists is not new. So there's a body, right, that, you know, people are aware of these situations. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=429.96000000000004s)]
*  So, you know, the call was made for legal support. There were, you know, a number of, you know, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=434.52000000000004s)]
*  activists, lawyers got on board and began kind of interpreting the matter. And they said, listen, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=442.84s)]
*  like, there is absolutely no crime being done. This is meritless. These accusations are absolutely [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=446.28s)]
*  meritless. And not only that, the material support clause is in and of itself, like, you know, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=451.96s)]
*  it's a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=459.55999999999995s)]
*  And not only that, the material support clause is in and of itself, like, you know, this, this [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=467.08000000000004s)]
*  egregious, you know, you know, relic of the USA Patriot Act, right. And we know, we know the [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=474.44s)]
*  terrible things that the USA Patriot Act has done, right. It is, you know, it's not a good [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=481.0s)]
*  thing to say the least, right. It has led to mass incarceration, mass surveillance, mass policing, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=487.72s)]
*  you know, mass death. I mean, it's, you know, these things are being used as kind of legitimizing of [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=493.32s)]
*  kind of the violent apparatus of the state force, which, you know, Omar, you can talk more about. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=499.32s)]
*  But in any case, so they're trying to bring it here. So the university's response was [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=503.56s)]
*  the San Francisco states. And I say this because you, Seymour said, followed the pattern exactly. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=513.56s)]
*  The academic approach was that this is academic freedom. We will let the event go on with caveat, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=518.68s)]
*  because the other academic approach was we don't agree with their speech. Their speech is anti-Semitic. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=531.4799999999999s)]
*  Their speech is hatred, but we're going to protect the speech. And this is the same thing that they [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=538.12s)]
*  do with white supremacy on campus, right. It's the same. And so in that one stroke, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=543.16s)]
*  you know, they say they're going to protect our academic freedom and people congratulate them for, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=549.8s)]
*  but at what cost? Because they're saying that these people are terrorists, these people are [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=553.0s)]
*  terrorist supporters, and these people are anti-Semite, but we're going to accept them [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=556.36s)]
*  nonetheless, right. So it was a completely, completely inappropriate response in terms of [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=560.4399999999999s)]
*  how they conceptualize our narratives, right, and what we were teaching. On top of that, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=567.48s)]
*  what the university then did was held a vigil for Jewish students to discuss anti-Semitism, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=574.9200000000001s)]
*  where they invited, I think like ADL, Campus Hallel, I believe the Israeli consulate also was part of [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=582.9200000000001s)]
*  it. The university provost was a provost, the president spoke at the provost office, as well [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=590.6800000000001s)]
*  as the equity, diversity and inclusion office co-sponsored this event. Right. So essentially [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=596.52s)]
*  the university is pushing that line is that we hate what they're saying, you know, we hate what [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=600.92s)]
*  these Palestinians are saying. We hate, you know, don't support the Palestinians, but we're going [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=607.0s)]
*  to let it happen because we're so, we're so, we're so, you know, whatever they want to call themselves, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=612.84s)]
*  right. It's a free speech, allegedly. Right. Yeah. While they're smearing us and basically [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=619.8s)]
*  putting us in the same box as white supremacists. They're delegitimizing you is what they're doing. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=627.16s)]
*  Right. Exactly. Exactly. And so then what happened was we decided to push the university on many [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=631.16s)]
*  fronts, but one of the fronts was to say, give us an alternative platform. Okay. We said if we were [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=640.04s)]
*  in person and let's say, you know, a water pipe breaks in the building, you're going to relocate [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=644.52s)]
*  my classroom. You're going to give me another classroom. Okay. We don't agree with Zoom, what [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=650.36s)]
*  was Zoom said about shutting down our event because they shut down the event the morning of, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=655.0799999999999s)]
*  but we're going to say, give us an alternative platform that has the same capacities that can [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=661.4s)]
*  reach the 1500 people that all the, the university's response was we don't have the technological [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=665.64s)]
*  capacity to do that. You can't use their, their contracted was with, I think Microsoft teams. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=672.92s)]
*  So we can't use teams for San Francisco's policies. You can't use teams for course [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=680.12s)]
*  instruction. Yeah. It's not, it's not intended for that. It's intended for like team building [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=690.28s)]
*  or whatever. So they said, why don't you use your personal Microsoft, Microsoft Skype account, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=693.7199999999999s)]
*  use your personal Skype account and then go ahead and get a third party system or download [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=699.32s)]
*  a third party software integrated into the Skype, your personal Skype that would allow for streaming [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=705.48s)]
*  and then stream it to your personal, you know, social media site, like Facebook or whatever. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=711.32s)]
*  And we're like, listen, this is the morning of the event. What? I don't know how to integrate [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=716.7600000000001s)]
*  third party software to allow Skype to go and like, I don't know how to do this, right? Do it [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=723.96s)]
*  for us. They can't do it for us because it's not technically, then they say, well, they can't do [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=731.4000000000001s)]
*  it because it's not technically San Francisco property because it's not San Francisco software. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=735.08s)]
*  Right. So now they, it becomes outside of the bounds of the AT. So now they've done their duty [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=738.84s)]
*  by giving us alternative that has, but then they also have done it in a way that they actually [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=743.72s)]
*  don't have to provide any support whatsoever because they don't own any of the software rights [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=748.52s)]
*  to the things that they've just suggested to us. So now basically they've done nothing, right? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=753.4s)]
*  They've done nothing to help us. And so what we ended up doing was we're like, okay, we're just [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=758.76s)]
*  going to go, we ended up buying another software out of our own pocket that had these things [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=764.36s)]
*  integrated and stream yard. And what we ended up doing was using that to then go through [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=771.8s)]
*  Facebook and YouTube channel. And we got all of our morning up, we're texting everybody, can we get [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=780.04s)]
*  your login information? Your cohost of this event, can we go ahead and broadcast on your YouTube [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=786.04s)]
*  channel, on your face, everybody, right? All these different orgs. Everybody's like, yes, go, go, go, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=791.3199999999999s)]
*  go do it. We start 23 minutes into it. They just shut it down. They pull it from Facebook. They [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=795.3199999999999s)]
*  pull it from YouTube. They pull it from all these different things. Till this day, they're like, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=803.56s)]
*  they pull it from all these different things till this day. So then what ended up happening was we [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=807.88s)]
*  got all these warnings, right? Facebook sent me all these warnings. YouTube didn't even send a [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=811.56s)]
*  warning. YouTube froze us. It's been months till this day. The Aamid YouTube channel is frozen. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=817.0s)]
*  I cannot live stream on the YouTube channel on Aamid for six months and more. And what was [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=828.6s)]
*  interesting was we went through every process. So we got the notification. I appealed it. The [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=834.92s)]
*  appeal was denied. Then we went through and they said that their judgment is that they're going to [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=839.56s)]
*  freeze our live stream for I think like 30 days or some period of time. The day after I went in, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=845.4s)]
*  tried the live stream, nothing. Six months later, tried live, nothing. What they've told us they're [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=852.04s)]
*  going to do isn't even what they've done. It's just been a perpetual freeze. So now what they did, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=857.8s)]
*  fast forward to last week, is we went through the same process. We're like, okay, we'll do the same [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=864.44s)]
*  thing we did last time. We'll go on Facebook. We can't use YouTube, but we'll go on our Facebook [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=871.72s)]
*  page. We didn't want to use Zoom, but we wanted to have some sort of place where we could collect [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=876.36s)]
*  names so that we could email them, say, go to this link. Eventbrite shut us down. We tried the UC [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=883.72s)]
*  Merced Zoom first. UC Merced Zoom account shut us down. I'll go back to this because there was a [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=891.4s)]
*  new contract that Zoom signed with the UC that should have actually prevented this, but it [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=899.72s)]
*  actually shouldn't have because the way that they structured it was intentional so that when it came [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=904.4399999999999s)]
*  about Palestine again, they could censor it. They did it to protect other issues, but when it came [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=908.84s)]
*  to Palestine, it was strategic in that they wrote in an exception so they could literally do this [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=916.76s)]
*  again. But anyway, Eventbrite got taken down. Zoom got taken down. Facebook, now our whole channel on [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=922.6s)]
*  Facebook is gone. It's not frozen. It's not like we can't even edit it. It's gone. They deleted it. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=932.28s)]
*  They unpublished it. So that means the years of archive that we have on the Facebook channel [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=938.52s)]
*  is gone. And you're like, well, why would an academic program use Facebook as an academic [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=944.92s)]
*  archive? That's what it's come to in the sense that there has been years and years and years [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=950.36s)]
*  and years of attacks and undermining of the AAMC program and Dr. Blahati where in order for us to [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=957.16s)]
*  get our content out there, in order for us to actually use things that are to reach our [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=962.1999999999999s)]
*  audiences, reach those who are part of our classrooms, is we went to social media. So we [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=969.64s)]
*  would have a webinar. We'd have an event. And this is even pre-COVID. We'd do an event online [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=976.1999999999999s)]
*  because there are people from across the world who watch these things. It's not just those who have [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=982.12s)]
*  access to San Francisco State on a nine-to-five schedule. We're like, no, no, that's not the way [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=986.92s)]
*  the world works. Right. So years of video archives just removed, taken down, unpublished, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=991.48s)]
*  gone. And so now there's a push to get Facebook to reinstate the AAMC page, not only so that we can [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=999.5600000000001s)]
*  reach our audiences again through that platform, but also to get back the archive that's now gone. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1007.08s)]
*  I mean, interviews, webinars, everything, everything's gone. Omar, did you want to [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1013.64s)]
*  Well, maybe Omar, you can talk a little bit about the Zoom guidelines that Salim just mentioned and [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1021.48s)]
*  the caveat that they inserted in there for Palestine-related issues. Yeah, that's [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1031.72s)]
*  significant. Tell us a little bit about that. Yeah. So what's interesting about this whole thing is [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1038.3600000000001s)]
*  the initial reason given for not letting the event proceed as Salim mentioned was [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1047.8s)]
*  Leila Khaled's presence and her affiliation with a quote unquote known terrorist organization. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1053.0s)]
*  In reality, again, for the reasons Salim mentioned, like this argument and application [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1058.68s)]
*  of potential material support charges and enforcement of censorship based on that is [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1063.6399999999999s)]
*  completely baseless because the event itself is whose narrative is gender justice and liberation. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1067.3999999999999s)]
*  So Leila Khaled, along with all the other panelists, is coming to talk about the [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1073.08s)]
*  interconnection between the anti-colonial liberation, gender justice and liberation, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1077.0s)]
*  and ultimately the interconnections across different movements for anti-colonial [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1082.6799999999998s)]
*  liberation throughout history. But secondly, because these things were ultimately baseless [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1087.48s)]
*  at the legal level, what had happened was you sort of Zoom had crossed this Rubicon where they became [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1095.32s)]
*  ultimately the content sensor of academic speech, of academic programming. And that's why I think [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1100.36s)]
*  in September after this happened, you had a big mobilization obviously from those of us in the [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1108.1999999999998s)]
*  Palestine movement, Palestine's solidarity movement, we're trying to promote it and talk about it as [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1112.9199999999998s)]
*  much as we could. But you also had places like the AAUP talking about how this is a huge infringement [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1116.6799999999998s)]
*  on academic speech because what you had was a private tech company saying what can and cannot [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1121.8799999999999s)]
*  be allowed to proceed as pedagogical material, which is a very, very dangerous precedent to set. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1127.32s)]
*  Now the other kind of frustrating irony of all of this is that as this initially, when it seemed [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1135.24s)]
*  like the UC Merced event might be allowed to proceed, maybe there was a day or so where [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1144.04s)]
*  there was a bit of uncertainty about that, it seemed like, okay, maybe finally there's a [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1148.6s)]
*  realization that something has been transgressed, this was an overstep, we can kind of go back to [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1152.6s)]
*  the days of no more content moderation. And indeed, Zoom released a statement saying we're [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1159.08s)]
*  going to refrain from content moderation when it comes to academic programming. But they had three [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1163.0s)]
*  caveats actually, and I actually have them right in front of me. So what they said was Zoom will [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1169.7199999999998s)]
*  only act on reports alleging content-related violations of our community standards or terms [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1175.8799999999999s)]
*  of service that come from the meetings hosted by the account owners. So it'll only act on content-related [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1180.52s)]
*  violations unless, three points, the first point, Zoom determines there is legal or regulatory risk [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1186.04s)]
*  to Zoom if it does not act. Point two, the report alleges an immediate threat to the physical safety [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1191.72s)]
*  of any person. Or point three, the meeting or webinar is unrelated to the institution's academics [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1197.0s)]
*  or operations. And to me in particular, the third one is especially astounding because this is Zoom [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1202.12s)]
*  assuming the authority to say what is and is not relevant to an academic institution. So again, I [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1207.56s)]
*  can't say enough. I really think we should not decenter Palestine from this because this is first [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1214.84s)]
*  and foremost about Palestine. But the implications of this I think are very, very staggering because [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1219.24s)]
*  we are in a moment where private tech companies, profit-driven private tech companies, have taken [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1224.44s)]
*  it upon themselves to directly censor a classroom and give themselves the authority to do that. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1230.52s)]
*  And lastly, I think the interconnection to the deletion of the Amid Studies Facebook page, as [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1234.76s)]
*  Salim mentioned also on April 13th, is very important when we think of the question of [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1242.76s)]
*  Palestine because as you know, the Zionist colonization of Palestine, obviously it's about [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1247.64s)]
*  the elimination of Palestinians. It's about the physical removal of Palestinians and ethnic [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1253.0s)]
*  cleansing, but it's also about the erasure of Palestinian voices. It's also about the erasure [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1257.72s)]
*  of Palestinian stories, the complete deletion of Palestine from the landmass, from the map, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1261.8s)]
*  and from ultimately the political imaginary. And so what's happening now as these technologies become [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1268.84s)]
*  more streamlined, as the forces of surveillance, capitalism, and for-profit white supremacy become [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1274.28s)]
*  more and more entrenched, they are directly acting on this imperative in sort of ways that utilize [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1279.56s)]
*  new technology for the same kind of violent means of resistance and erasure, those who resist [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1285.24s)]
*  the erasure, I should say. Let's talk a little bit about how, I mean, what, you know, maybe people [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1291.16s)]
*  like don't grasp enough the significance of these private corporations being able to be arbiters of [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1301.96s)]
*  what can and cannot be taught or talked about in academic settings. And if Zoom and Facebook and [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1311.88s)]
*  YouTube continue to get away with this and be so, you know, like they capitulate so easily to, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1320.92s)]
*  you know, the Israeli government, for example, which funds that app that Celine was talking [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1332.92s)]
*  about earlier, Act.IL, Israel lobby groups here in the U.S., and lawmakers who, you know, are [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1338.76s)]
*  allied with Israel lobby organizations, like if those, if that becomes kind of a standard, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1347.88s)]
*  what does that mean for other liberation movements and other topics that, you know, that might not [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1358.8400000000001s)]
*  be favorable to these like corporate tech giants? [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1367.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, so, I mean, I would say, and then, Celine, if you'd like to add, feel free to jump in, but for [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1372.6s)]
*  me, it's really going to be a domino effect. I mean, you know, what we've seen from this new [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1377.72s)]
*  statement that Zoom released is they've already effectively codified their ability to decide what [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1382.2s)]
*  is and isn't relevant to academic programming. So, you know, and I think really we're going to see, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1386.68s)]
*  you know, sort of an ongoing policing, repression, and silencing of genuine anti-colonial [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1393.32s)]
*  knowledge production, right? And, you know, what's I think so important about, you know, a project [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1399.0800000000002s)]
*  like Aamid Studies and about, you know, the collaborations that Aamid Studies has had with [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1405.72s)]
*  programs like, you know, Women and Gender Studies program at San Francisco State and all of the [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1409.64s)]
*  amazing panelists is that also that this was free, right? But let's not forget that this was [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1414.1200000000001s)]
*  programming that was open to anybody who just wanted to see it, who wanted to learn, who wanted [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1417.8000000000002s)]
*  to hear about these histories. So, you know, when I say anti-colonial programming and [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1421.3200000000002s)]
*  pedagogy, I don't just mean, you know, in content, something that talks about a history of liberation. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1425.96s)]
*  It's also something that tries to realize through praxis, right? Kind of challenge the stranglehold [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1429.4s)]
*  that private companies have, you know, that copyrights have, that all of these forces that [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1435.0s)]
*  try to really instill a kind of intellectual and educational apartheid in the larger culture at [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1440.44s)]
*  large, challenging that through a praxis that's also anti-colonial. I think we're going to continue [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1446.76s)]
*  to see a repression in the future. And I think that's something that we're going to see in the [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1450.76s)]
*  repression and the policing of that. You know, if anything, efforts like this need to be lauded [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1454.76s)]
*  and they need to be seen as really at the forefront of challenging, you know, the ongoing [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1458.92s)]
*  privatization of, you know, intellectual work of education and of academia, you know. But I [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1463.64s)]
*  definitely think, you know, it's not going to bode well for anything that is inherently anti-colonial, [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1470.12s)]
*  you know, in its bent moving forward. So I definitely think now is the time more than ever [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1475.8799999999999s)]
*  for all of us who profess to have anti-colonial ethos to do any kind of work that is sufficiently [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1481.8s)]
*  challenging, Alicinian colonization, you know, the colonization of black and indigenous peoples all [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1488.04s)]
*  across the world. The time is now to really stand against this repression. Yeah. Yeah, Salim, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1494.36s)]
*  did you want to add to that? Yeah, I just think that also when we're talking about like what's [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1500.6s)]
*  happening in the classroom is that this is, it is a fight to even have those classrooms in the first [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1506.12s)]
*  place, right? And I think that this is what's, you know, when we're talking about these private [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1511.48s)]
*  companies and as Omar, you were talking about the privatization of the university is that Ahmed [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1518.76s)]
*  started in 2006, 2007. And when Dr. Blahedi came there, she signed, you know, a memorandum of [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1524.68s)]
*  understanding part of like her hiring contract with the university that she would come with [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1534.76s)]
*  three faculty members that the university would hire to build up the Ahmed program, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1541.16s)]
*  because we understand that one person is not a program. It cannot be, right? You need a body, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1546.1200000000001s)]
*  you need a collective to constitute a program. We're in 2021. She's the only professor [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1554.04s)]
*  in Ahmed studies. We have a few lecturers, you know, sometimes, you know, other times they fire [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1563.24s)]
*  lecturers at heart in a second, right? Which happened, you know, especially, which has been [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1569.32s)]
*  happening over time, right? So why I say this is because like, for instance, they just cut [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1574.76s)]
*  Ahmed summer classes. We're not going to, there are not going to be, the university has officially [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1579.8s)]
*  cut the Ahmed classes for the summer, right? So now when we're talking about what is, what [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1586.76s)]
*  Zoom is doing to censor a webinar, it's very important, but it's part of the larger web of [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1592.12s)]
*  what the universities are doing, right? They have essentially like, they've defunded the [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1597.88s)]
*  Ahmed studies program. They've refused to hire tenure track faculty members. In 2009, we were [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1604.6000000000001s)]
*  so close to getting a tenure track faculty member. Searches went out for the hire. Searches went out [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1610.3600000000001s)]
*  for the hire. Then what ended up happening, there was an event, a joint event of the Edward Said [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1616.1200000000001s)]
*  mural that we have at San Francisco state. And part of the mural celebration was Gapsa [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1622.1200000000001s)]
*  Jano Union of Palestine students invited Omar Barhouti to come and give remarks at the ceremony. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1626.2s)]
*  Zionists attacked the event. I mean, they smeared the event. They smeared Omar Barhouti. They [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1633.0800000000002s)]
*  smeared the Ahmed program. They smeared Dr. Blatty. They smeared Gaps. The university president [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1637.56s)]
*  Corrigan, Robert Corrigan at the time, his response was to cut the searches for the hires in 2009. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1641.48s)]
*  Under the pretext that it was because the 2008 economic crash that the university was cash [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1650.8400000000001s)]
*  strapped and they could no longer afford hiring a new professor. Supposed this was over 10 years ago. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1658.3600000000001s)]
*  There was an economic recovery. Position was never reassigned. These are not financial decisions that [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1666.68s)]
*  these are political decisions that they're using the finance to legitimize their decisions. This [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1676.2s)]
*  is the same thing they did with COVID. Under COVID, they cut Ahmed classes by 66%. The course [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1682.1200000000001s)]
*  offerings, what courses Dr. Blatty taught as the only professor at the department, they ended up [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1687.48s)]
*  forcibly, she had to teach courses outside of the Ahmed program. For the first time, they forced her [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1692.92s)]
*  to teach classes outside of the Ahmed program in the fall. She's the only Ahmed professor. Now, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1702.84s)]
*  she can't even teach an Ahmed class. She has to teach a different class. Then what they ended up [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1709.56s)]
*  doing was they're firing all the lectures that we had lined up. They're not allowing the program to [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1714.1999999999998s)]
*  grow. When we're talking about they're canceling a classroom, yes, it's significant, it's huge. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1721.8799999999999s)]
*  The implications, I'm not trying to diminish them, they're huge. They're part and parcel of [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1728.68s)]
*  the fact that they're also canceling entire courses, canceling entire programs. We know that under, [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1733.0800000000002s)]
*  by the way, just to finish the narrative here, California governor issued a statement saying [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1739.0800000000002s)]
*  that all university funding will be restored to 2020 levels, essentially saying that the huge [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1750.12s)]
*  scare, the huge financial divestment that are, what's that divestment, what's it called? They [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1760.68s)]
*  were trying to undertake yet more austerity measures, defund public spending and all this [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1772.68s)]
*  stuff. He said that actually they're reversing course and they're not going to defund the [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1778.2s)]
*  university. They're going to restore the funding. They're going to restore all the classes. They [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1782.2s)]
*  haven't done that. As I said, even though they announced that they're restoring all the funding, [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1785.24s)]
*  the Ahmed summer classes are gone. They cut them from the books. There are talks about how we can [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1790.1200000000001s)]
*  respond to that. I'm not going to go into it because they're not done yet, but we may do [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1796.2s)]
*  something outside of the, we may not. I don't know. I don't want to go into it yet because [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1800.44s)]
*  there's still so many decisions, but even one of the things that we were actually discussing [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1806.28s)]
*  before getting on the call was one of the options that we had was, okay, they canceled the formal [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1811.96s)]
*  official Ahmed summer classes. We can do open classes on Facebook because we've known about [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1817.16s)]
*  this before they canceled. Well, now they canceled the Facebook page. Now we can't even do that. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1822.2s)]
*  Do you see? It's so embedded. I'll just stop there, but I think that I also wanted to, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1827.08s)]
*  actually it won't because I wanted to talk about the UC's academic Senate because they have taken [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1835.72s)]
*  action. Yeah. So the UC, University of California is separate from CSU, which is the California [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1844.3600000000001s)]
*  state university system. And SF state, just for our listeners and viewers, SF state is part of the [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1849.56s)]
*  California state university system. UC Merced is part of the university of California. So yeah, [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1855.72s)]
*  talk about what the university of California did recently. Yeah. And I think that it's significant [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1861.56s)]
*  because the first thing that happened is they, I guess, and one thing I wanted to say about the [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1871.3999999999999s)]
*  way the UCs operate is that they operate as one university with multiple campuses. So this is their [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1877.6399999999999s)]
*  logic, right? So like it's the university of California and then the various, like Berkeley, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1884.12s)]
*  LA, Riverside, Davis, all of them, right? So Merced, so what they do is they have these like [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1889.4s)]
*  joint committees and councils. So the university committee on academic freedom, this is the [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1896.0400000000002s)]
*  university wide, issued a statement to their subcommittee of the academic Senate. So that [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1902.2800000000002s)]
*  committee issued a statement to the whole academic Senate. And in it, I just want to read their [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1915.16s)]
*  concluding paragraph where they say, as UCAF, so the university of California academic freedom, [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1919.24s)]
*  has said before, and it's quote, the university's responsibility to protect academic freedom and [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1925.64s)]
*  freedom of expression cannot be outsourced, close quote, taking the legal steps necessary to provide [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1932.28s)]
*  clarity about what kinds of academic activities the law allows is ultimately the university's [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1939.8799999999999s)]
*  responsibility, not that of Zoom or any other private company. And the, another section is [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1946.04s)]
*  our faculty and students quote, should not be required to await and undergo criminal prosecution [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1958.2s)]
*  to know whether their academic activities are protected by the first amendment or criminalized [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1967.0s)]
*  under the material support law. And this is key. They're basically saying to the provost of the [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1972.76s)]
*  university, how dare you? Like, A, how dare you take these steps that essentially [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1978.04s)]
*  move forward as if these students are engaging in these crimes, which they're not. In fact, nobody [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1986.04s)]
*  is, right? Nobody's doing that. That's not even a question that the lawyers are entertaining. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1990.76s)]
*  The lawyers, legal counsel that we've discussed that this is ridiculous, right? So I want to make [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1995.48s)]
*  that very clear. These are meritless accusations, but despite their meritlessness, they're still [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=1999.4s)]
*  being operated on by university officials and corporate officials as if they are fact, [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2005.56s)]
*  and they are not. And that, you know, that is, that is what's kind of underpinning all of this, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2012.44s)]
*  is they are moving forward as if we have already committed a crime when no crime has been committed. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2018.52s)]
*  Right. And, you know, that's not new, right? We know that this is the unfortunate reality of how [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2025.8s)]
*  this, of how our society's, you know, how power operates in our society, right? And as Omar, you [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2031.96s)]
*  were talking about, and I think you can talk more about, but what ended up happening was then the [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2039.0s)]
*  academic Senate took the statement that the UC, the academic freedom committee issued, and they [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2044.3600000000001s)]
*  forwarded it to, they forwarded it with their own statements. They added another statement, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2051.96s)]
*  and they sent it to Michael Drake, the president of the university of California. And in it, they [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2057.32s)]
*  lay out the concerns, they lay out all of the concerns that have been presented by the academic [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2064.04s)]
*  freedom committee, and they are pushing now the university president, UC president to take action [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2071.32s)]
*  to prevent these sorts of things from happening again. At the, you know, not only the accusations [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2079.64s)]
*  of criminal activity, but also the censorship. So the two parts here. And might as we add that [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2086.28s)]
*  these accusations are rooted in Islamophobia. I mean, you know, they're, this is very self-evident, [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2092.44s)]
*  right? The accusation of Islamophobia is sufficient to mark one as, you know, the, I know, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2098.36s)]
*  the accusation of terrorism is enough to mark one as terrorism, right? You are guilty upon accusation, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2103.4s)]
*  like why? Because our names are, you know, the Ombud program, like, you know, it's anyway. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2108.2s)]
*  Right. And, and yeah, I mean, the university of California and most other university systems [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2115.72s)]
*  and administrations have been, you know, like very quick to do these preemptive censorship acts [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2122.52s)]
*  because they're scared of losing federal funding, because Israel lobby groups, you know, threaten [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2133.4s)]
*  them with all sorts of litigation. They say that, you know, for example, if you have a Palestine [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2139.3199999999997s)]
*  centered event on campus, you know, it could make some Jewish students feel uncomfortable and [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2145.08s)]
*  therefore would violate title six of the 1964 civil rights act, you know, for discrimination. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2150.52s)]
*  And completely baseless accusations that, you know, have been thrown out by the department of [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2156.68s)]
*  education when they've been fighting, you know, when these complaints have been filed, but nonetheless, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2163.4s)]
*  you know, these university administrations are very scared of litigation. They listen [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2169.88s)]
*  to their donors first and, and they're very happy to kind of accommodate Israel lobby requests. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2177.24s)]
*  Even when it comes to censoring their own members of faculty. And it's, it's just, it's phenomenal. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2186.04s)]
*  With that said, what, how are academics and students fighting back and what is the recourse, [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2196.12s)]
*  you know, after the event in September and now just, you know, very recently at UC Merced. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2203.96s)]
*  One more, do you want to take this one? [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2209.88s)]
*  Sure. Yeah, I'll, I'll get it started. And then if there's anything I leave out, you know, [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2217.2400000000002s)]
*  feel free to jump in. I mean, definitely, you know, we've seen, so, you know, what happened after [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2221.2400000000002s)]
*  September, for example, you know, there was the, basically there was a sort of a US [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2230.84s)]
*  ACBE kind of week of action, you know, where basically universities all over the country [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2235.56s)]
*  sort of staged their own open classrooms, you know, along with a video, you know, of Leila Khaled, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2242.04s)]
*  basically challenging this, you know, and on zoom, the point is do it on zoom, sort of challenge [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2248.84s)]
*  the censorship and several were censored, you know, as I believe even electronic and to further [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2252.52s)]
*  reported, right? You saw that New York university, I think was one of the most prominent ones. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2257.08s)]
*  And so, you know, which was interesting because, you know, on the one hand, their solidarity events, [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2261.4s)]
*  but they also show that this is kind of an ongoing campaign, right? But at least I think in a sense, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2268.04s)]
*  there was something in the public record, you know, that that was happening. There were academic [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2273.1600000000003s)]
*  organizations who signed on to statements, basically protesting, you know, this is a violation [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2277.7200000000003s)]
*  of academic speech, you had a UP coming out, you know, when really criticizing, you know, what zoom [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2283.1600000000003s)]
*  and what tech companies were doing. And so I think, you know, really academically, there was a movement [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2288.44s)]
*  of recognizing the larger significance of what was happening. I should say the specific and larger [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2295.0s)]
*  significance, because I think both contexts should not be displaced. So I think the mobilization on [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2299.16s)]
*  this and also, you know, you had organizations like the fire, which, you know, I think politically is [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2304.2000000000003s)]
*  a little bit back and forth, but ultimately they did defend this as, you know, being very much a [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2308.92s)]
*  first amendment. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. So I think that, you know, there was kind of a strength in [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2313.0s)]
*  that mobilization because, you know, it really allowed for something that a lot of different [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2319.4s)]
*  forces and organizations could plug into. Meanwhile, you know, as Palestinian and Palestinian [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2323.32s)]
*  led organizations, you know, we also sort of tried to challenge this, you know, as directly a violation [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2328.12s)]
*  or an attack really upon Palestinian peoplehood, Palestinian identity, and collectivities, you know, [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2334.04s)]
*  such as the Palestine Feminist Working Group, you know, released an important statement about how [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2340.44s)]
*  this is not just the silencing of, you know, one open classroom. It's not just the silencing of [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2344.36s)]
*  Leila Khalid. It's really, you know, a reinforcement of the patriarchal violence, you know, that Zionism [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2349.4s)]
*  ultimately upholds. So it's not just the silencing of Palestinian voices. It's the silencing of [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2356.28s)]
*  Palestinian feminist voices and narratives. So it's an ongoing kind of symbolic recreation and [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2360.2000000000003s)]
*  reinfliction of the very, you know, kind of founding violence that Zionism initiates, you know, [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2365.56s)]
*  with its ethnic cleansing, with its colonization, and with its, you know, machinations of apartheid. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2370.68s)]
*  So really, this is, you know, at the lexical level, at the symbolic level, the violence of Zionism [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2376.28s)]
*  being reinforced all over again. So I think, you know, while there's a lot of emphasis put into [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2381.2400000000002s)]
*  challenging narratives, I think that there is a kind of power in that because a lot of times [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2387.64s)]
*  what these institutions will rely on is this kind of, you know, our hands are tied, you know, [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2392.44s)]
*  there's an official sort of decree and we just have to follow it. In reality, they don't have [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2396.84s)]
*  to follow anything. They're making their own choices. And so when people push back and say, [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2400.76s)]
*  this is actually not the full story, there's something that's being left out. There's people [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2404.6800000000003s)]
*  that are being silenced. You know, then really there's something larger that I think acts on [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2408.36s)]
*  the public imagination. And I think that allows for greater mobilization. Yeah. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2412.6s)]
*  It just, this whole thing just seems really, once again, Palestine is the sort of canary in the [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2417.72s)]
*  coal mine, because it's a complete corporate takeover really on every level. Like, I mean, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2426.12s)]
*  you know, I mean, you know, we're supposed to be in the future, we're in the future, we have [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2433.16s)]
*  video phones. But these, you know, these corporations are just using the new technology [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2438.92s)]
*  and to basically aggregate more power to themselves, you know. So it's a really scary [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2446.36s)]
*  time really in a lot of ways. And I find it really interesting as well how Act.IL has got involved, [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2455.16s)]
*  one of Israel's troll armies, essentially, you know, they're funded. It's a big organization, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2465.72s)]
*  you know, it is an app, but I think it's almost downplaying it to just describe it as an app, [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2473.96s)]
*  because it's an organization which is founded, which is funded to the tune of a million dollars [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2480.6s)]
*  a year that we know of, partly by the state of Israel, partly by the Adelsons, the casino billionaires, [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2488.7599999999998s)]
*  and Israel lobby funders. And it is run and coordinated by Israel's Ministry of Strategic [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2495.08s)]
*  Affairs. So it's very much linked to the state of Israel, it very much pushes the agenda of the [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2502.52s)]
*  state of Israel. So we can see that this is something that, you know, is important for, [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2507.48s)]
*  it's important enough that the state of Israel feels like it's a priority that they should be [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2518.36s)]
*  trying to sabotage. So yeah, there's a lot of issues here that, you know, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2522.28s)]
*  not that people in general should be concerned about, not only Palestine solidarity activists. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2528.44s)]
*  Yeah, I think you're right about that. If I can just chime in really quickly, I mean, I think that [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2537.5600000000004s)]
*  that is the other factor, you know, in sort of some of the statements that we tried to put together [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2542.44s)]
*  for support for Amid studies, we did note that this is always tied to Israeli government aligned [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2548.6s)]
*  organizations, you know, but we also know, as you're saying, you know, I believe since 2016, [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2553.56s)]
*  the Intercept was reporting that Facebook was working with the Israeli government to silence, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2558.36s)]
*  to censor Palestinian content, right? And if anything, this idea, you know, the so-called [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2562.44s)]
*  content violations where people are getting their posts taken down, their pages deleted for temporary, [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2567.64s)]
*  usually amounts of time, is only increasing, right? And you saw recently there was the petition from [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2572.6s)]
*  Jewish voice for peace, you know, to oppose the word Zionist being included, you know, as sort of [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2578.12s)]
*  interchangeable with Jewish person and Facebook's hate speech policies. And of course, you know, [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2583.4s)]
*  you see reporting from Al-Shebaka about how YouTube has also been collaborating in the censorship, [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2587.72s)]
*  you know, in addition to what we've seen specifically in the case of Ahmed, which I think is [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2592.3599999999997s)]
*  very much at the crux of all of this, we know that the Israeli government has been working [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2596.2799999999997s)]
*  with tech companies to censor this content for years now. So I think you're right to flag that, [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2599.7999999999997s)]
*  and it is very important for people to be aware of, you know, but also to realize that, you know, [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2606.04s)]
*  it's a huge problem when things that should be open source, when things that are supposed to be [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2610.92s)]
*  about communication are really being so regulated both by the profit margin and, you know, by various [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2614.84s)]
*  forces of, you know, colonial supremacy, of white supremacy and of political repression. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2621.72s)]
*  You know, people, I think there's a kind of dialectical nature to social media where people [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2627.96s)]
*  rightly point out that it allowed for a lot of inroads in terms of how you could challenge [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2632.76s)]
*  official narratives. Now you can record yourself, now you can upload things, now you can show videos, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2636.76s)]
*  you know, of things that the state otherwise wants covered up. All that's true, but over the years, [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2641.8s)]
*  I think the companies have also found ways to really refine the profit margin, refine the [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2646.2000000000003s)]
*  surveillance margin, and really refine, you know, their hold and their stranglehold on what people [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2650.1200000000003s)]
*  can and can't say on who should and shouldn't be watched and who should and shouldn't be censored. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2655.7200000000003s)]
*  I think that, you know, if we don't fight back, these types of things are only going to become [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2660.2s)]
*  more entrenched, more invasive, and more politically repressive, even than we're seeing now. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2664.52s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think they really are expanding their power because, you know, in previous [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2670.52s)]
*  generations of technology, you know, just telephones, mobile phones, yeah, they were all owned by [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2675.24s)]
*  corporations, but by and large, states still had the power over what can and can't be said over the [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2680.68s)]
*  telephone, you know, within certain margins, at least anyway. But now we're reaching the stage [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2690.8399999999997s)]
*  where corporations, these massive unaccountable Silicon Valley corporations, are just entrenching [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2695.8799999999997s)]
*  more power to themselves, really. So it's very dangerous. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2703.8s)]
*  That's all terms of service. That's the thing, you know, we can't have Leila Khaled because of our [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2710.44s)]
*  quote unquote terms of service. You can't do this class because of our terms of service. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2714.6000000000004s)]
*  And ultimately, what is the political subtext in terms of service? We know what it is, and the more [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2718.44s)]
*  institutions under this neoliberal moment continue to outsource themselves to the private interests [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2722.6000000000004s)]
*  of capital and repression, the more we're going to see these types of things. And ultimately, [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2728.04s)]
*  everything is going to become, you know, quotidian as who can and can't say what to things even more [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2736.68s)]
*  dystopian to, you know, what is and isn't permitted sort of political life. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2741.96s)]
*  If I may say one thing, I think, I mean, it has to be said that this is kind of the result of [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2748.92s)]
*  an increased, you know, calls for censorship, which has been supported not only by [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2757.4s)]
*  political elites in the United States, but also the media. And it's, you know, we saw it like a [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2763.08s)]
*  climax during the 2016 US presidential elections. But now you've got like a bipartisan chorus [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2768.76s)]
*  that's begging Silicon Valley overlords to do their authoritarian bidding in the name of [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2777.8s)]
*  fact checking and in the name of political ads and so on. And even people like, you know, New York [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2783.48s)]
*  Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have joined these calls. And so it's always, you know, and [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2788.76s)]
*  when you actually look at these oversight boards that have been hired by, for example, Facebook, [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2796.68s)]
*  you see, I mean, at least in Facebook's example, Facebook hired the former director general of [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2803.0s)]
*  Israel's justice ministry in that oversight board that determines what content to censor or permit [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2808.28s)]
*  on its social media platform. And, you know, this former director general, Amy Palmer, [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2815.96s)]
*  she headed the justice ministry when, I'm sure you remember, Nora and Asa, when Ayelet [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2822.44s)]
*  Shaqed became notorious for making a Facebook post inciting the genocide of Palestinians. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2832.76s)]
*  And so this is the person that's on the Facebook oversight board. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2840.84s)]
*  That's crazy. I mean, yeah, I didn't realize she was at that time. Yeah. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2847.5600000000004s)]
*  It's pretty astonishing. Omar and Saleem, if people want to learn more, especially about [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2854.6800000000003s)]
*  AIMED studies, the Arab and Muslim ethnicities and diaspora program at San Francisco state, [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2862.6s)]
*  or what's happening around the UC Merced event, where can people go? It's kind of like, [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2870.6s)]
*  you know, I know that, you know, you've been censored from all of these regular platforms, [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2879.0s)]
*  but how can people kind of stay abreast of what's happening? [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2884.2s)]
*  Nora, I think you just published an article in Electronic Intifada. So that came out today. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2886.68s)]
*  So that's a, I mean, and then there's another article coming out tomorrow. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2899.56s)]
*  We're in by Dr. Blahari, Dr. Shalmaloi, who's a professor at UC Merced, Dr. Kinakawa, who I [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2907.8799999999997s)]
*  discussed myself, I believe is coming out in Mondowise sometime this week, maybe today or [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2915.72s)]
*  tomorrow. Jewish Voice for Peace issued a call to action regarding Facebook. So there's an action [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2920.12s)]
*  alert going around JVP. Maybe we can kind of share the links and it can go on the podcast when you [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2929.7999999999997s)]
*  all upload it. Yeah. Regarding Facebook, we, so I'll tell you what we did, because this [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2935.64s)]
*  what happened was the week before the event, Facebook had already taken down our Facebook page, [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2946.04s)]
*  okay? Downman says Facebook page, but it was Palestine Prisoners' Day, April 17th, and we had [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2954.68s)]
*  an event. And what we ended up doing was we worked with our orgs. We worked with kind of orgs that we [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2959.96s)]
*  historically work with, and we used their, not used, but we collaborated on their social media [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2971.4s)]
*  platforms and we sent out the live stream on their platforms, like their Facebook page and [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2978.84s)]
*  their YouTube page. And we've done it historically with a number of different orgs. It's not just [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2987.2400000000002s)]
*  that one time. Even a lot of our webinars, like, for instance, Salmori, you're part of PYM, PYM has [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2991.7200000000003s)]
*  hosted a number of these things. Eyewitness Palestine, National SJP, Sami Dune, like a lot of [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=2999.3199999999997s)]
*  these, a lot of different orgs kind of like will also use their presence to do that. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=3006.2s)]
*  That may be the route that we have to take into the immediate future until we can get our Facebook [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=3012.36s)]
*  page back, because mind you, it's not just the Facebook page they took down. They also took down [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=3016.12s)]
*  our YouTube page months ago. So we, like, what we have left is we have a Twitter page, so you can [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=3019.48s)]
*  follow us on Twitter, Amid Studies, and we have a, I believe, Instagram. I believe Instagram is [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=3027.88s)]
*  owned by Facebook. The irony is that they didn't take down the Instagram page, but they took down [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=3036.04s)]
*  the Facebook page. Like, okay. Which also raises something that Omar was talking about earlier, [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=3040.12s)]
*  about Leila Khaled actually spoke on Zoom a week after our event in September. I think she spoke [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=3050.12s)]
*  October 1st or something like that. So Dr. Bledeo always asks, what happened between September 23rd [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=3054.68s)]
*  and October 1st, where Zoom said that she was a terrorist and couldn't speak on September 23rd, [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=3060.9199999999996s)]
*  but she wasn't a terrorist on October 1st and she could speak? Like, what kind of ridiculousness is [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=3068.3599999999997s)]
*  this, right? So I think part of why I also want to raise that is the attacks are not accidental. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=3074.2799999999997s)]
*  They are going after the Ahmed program and they are going after Dr. Bledeo. Like, this is not the [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=3081.88s)]
*  first time that they have attacked and undermined the program. Let's not forget they filed two [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=3087.32s)]
*  lawsuits against San Francisco State, naming the actions of the Ahmed program, Dr. Bledeo, and [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=3092.1200000000003s)]
*  GUPS as primary grievances, if you will, that they filed in the lawsuit. One was in federal court, [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=3100.2000000000003s)]
*  one was in state court. One Dr. Bledeo was named explicitly as she was the only faculty member who [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=3107.72s)]
*  was named in the lawsuit. Like, she had to get a lawyer because they targeted her in the lawsuit, [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=3113.48s)]
*  right? Everybody else was university administrators. She was the only one that was a university [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=3119.8799999999997s)]
*  faculty that was named. So let's not forget, they're going after her, right? They're going [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=3124.9199999999996s)]
*  after her because of her policy and advocacy work. So yeah, I mean, we're fighting the good fight. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=3129.9599999999996s)]
*  We're pushing back. We're trying to get our platforms back. We're trying to use alternative [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=3136.92s)]
*  platforms. The thing is that we shouldn't be excluded from these spaces, which is what we're [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=3142.12s)]
*  all talking about now. These companies shouldn't have the authority that they have. But we're also [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=3149.48s)]
*  talking about these companies are rotten to the core, right? It's not like if once they restore [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=3155.2400000000002s)]
*  the Ahmed Facebook page that we're all going to den it. No, Facebook is rotten. Google Alphabet, [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=3160.6800000000003s)]
*  they're rotten. These things, these corporations, these monopolies, they're not a good, right? [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=3165.96s)]
*  So we could talk more and more about that, but it's not that once we get it, everything is... No, [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=3175.56s)]
*  no, the fight continues. But in the meantime, we demand our page back. We demand our archive back. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=3183.08s)]
*  We demand... This is a platform that people use, right? Hopefully Facebook is a passing phenomenon, [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=3189.48s)]
*  right? As Dr. Batia always says, Zionism is a passing phenomenon. Hopefully, [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=3197.32s)]
*  empires have come and gone, right? The Roman Empire fell, right? So these things don't last [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=3203.48s)]
*  forever. So in the meantime, we're sticking it out. Well, thank you. And we will put all of those [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=3212.28s)]
*  links on the podcast post that accompanies this podcast on the Electronic Intifada. Omar Zaza [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J9jEM0zL7g&t=3222.0400000000004s)]
