Video Description: On episode 72, we speak about the current situation in the occupied West Bank with Abdaljawad Omar from Palestine‚Äôs Birzeit University. 
In January alone, Israeli police, soldiers and settlers killed at least 35 Palestinians, including seven children, in the West Bank, as the violent repression in the territory that escalated throughout 2022 carried into the new year.
Those deaths include 10 Palestinians who were fatally injured during a raid in Jenin refugee camp ‚Äì the single deadliest operation in the West Bank since at least 2005, according to a UN official.
Israel‚Äôs escalation of violence and collective punishment is targeted against a new generation of Palestinian fighters who, Omar explains, are rising to challenge Israel‚Äôs power in the West Bank.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a rise of new spaces of resistance, if you want to call them ‚Äì they have made life harder for the Israeli military to enter and arrest and exercise the power of arrest, which has been going on for the past decade or so without much resistance,‚Äù he says.
He explains that in addition to Israel‚Äôs usual raids and arrest campaigns, the army is using its full force to quell this new generation of Palestinians.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre seeing self-defense zones defending themselves against an Israeli military that is attempting to kill them,‚Äù he says.
We also talk about the role of the Palestinian Authority, and its role as subcontractor to Israel‚Äôs occupation in the context of its diminishing economic and political power amongst Palestinians.
There is a ‚Äúform of ideological power that maintains the PA,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúbut still, there‚Äôs a process of unbinding happening, a process where people are rejecting that."

# New generation of resistance does not fear Israel, with Abdaljawad Omar | EI Podcast
**The Electronic Intifada:** [February 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8)
*  Because this kind of acceptance of death makes them outside the ability of Israeli power [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=0.0s)]
*  to enact itself. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=16.1s)]
*  So the intensity of violence actually represents Israel losing control. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=17.1s)]
*  It doesn't represent Israel actually maintaining. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=20.64s)]

*  This is the electronic intifada podcast. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=28.96s)]
*  I'm Nora Barrows Friedman. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=31.96s)]
*  And I'm Asa Winstanley. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=33.96s)]
*  Welcome back to the electronic intifada podcast and welcome to our first episode of 2023. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=39.96s)]
*  Today we're joined by Abdeljawad Hamayel, a PhD student and lecturer in the philosophy [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=45.96s)]
*  and cultural studies department at Birzeit University in Palestine to talk about the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=51.96s)]
*  current situation on the ground in the occupied West Bank. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=56.96s)]
*  As our senior editor Maureen Murphy reported, in January alone, Israeli police, soldiers [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=59.96s)]
*  and settlers killed at least 35 Palestinians, including seven children in the West Bank, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  as the violent repression in the territory that escalated throughout 2022 carried into [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  the new year. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  Those deaths include 10 Palestinians who were fatally injured during a raid in Janine refugee [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  camp, the single deadliest operation in the West Bank since at least 2005, according to [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=84.96s)]
*  a UN official. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=89.96s)]
*  The uptick in fatalities followed a series of deadly attacks in Israel during March of [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=91.96s)]
*  2022, several of them carried out by Palestinians from the Janine area of the northern West [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=96.96s)]
*  Bank, which has seen a resurgence in armed resistance against Israel's regime of apartheid [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=102.96s)]
*  occupation and settler colonization. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=107.96s)]
*  Since then, the Janine area has endured almost daily raids, resulting in dozens of deaths. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=111.96s)]
*  On January 26th, Israeli forces killed nine Palestinians during a raid in Janine refugee [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=117.96s)]
*  camp, a tenth Palestinian died from his injuries days later. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=123.96s)]
*  Two children and a 61-year-old woman were among those killed in the Janine raid. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=128.95999999999998s)]
*  Twenty Palestinians were injured, four of them critically, according to the health ministry. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=133.95999999999998s)]
*  Al Haq, a Palestinian human rights group, said that the raid began with a siege on a [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=138.96s)]
*  home in the camp. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=143.96s)]
*  Three occupants of the building were killed by Israeli shelling. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=145.96s)]
*  The military also bulldozed part of a community organization in the camp and targeted [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=149.96s)]
*  electricity generators, cutting off power and internet in the area, including to the main [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=153.96s)]
*  hospital in Janine, according to the rights group. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=159.96s)]
*  Palestinians in Gaza fired rockets toward Israel following the deadly Janine raid, and [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=162.96s)]
*  Israel hit sites in Gaza that it claimed were used to manufacture rockets. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=167.96s)]
*  That was from our Palestine in Pictures monthly report by our editor Maureen Murphy. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=172.96s)]
*  We'll have the link to that in the blog post that accompanies this episode. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=177.96s)]
*  Aboud Hamayel, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=181.96s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me. I'm glad to be here. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=185.96s)]
*  We're really glad you're here, too. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=189.96s)]
*  Can you talk about the last month in the West Bank in particular and what you've observed [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=191.96s)]
*  yourself in terms of the escalation in Israeli attacks and the current atmosphere on the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=196.96s)]
*  ground? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=201.96s)]
*  I think, I mean, the current situation is as follows, is that we in the West Bank, there's [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=203.96s)]
*  a rise of new spaces of resistance, if you want to call them like they have made life [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=209.96s)]
*  harder for the Israeli military to enter and arrest and exercise the power of arrest, which [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=218.96s)]
*  has been going on for the past decade or so without much resistance. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=223.96s)]
*  And these spaces have mostly been basically self-defense type of like, you know, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=228.96s)]
*  revolutionary positioning. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=237.96s)]
*  So they're not acting or enacting a lot of offensive operations. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=239.96s)]
*  They mostly handle the military when they enter these areas. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=244.96s)]
*  And this has created a situation where Israel is just not having it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=248.96s)]
*  So they're going in and exercising instead of the power of the arrest, the power of death, of killing [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=253.96s)]
*  and of creating this, what you rendered just previously, the intensity of death that is [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=260.96000000000004s)]
*  happening in the West Bank is a direct result of that. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=266.96000000000004s)]
*  So this is what's happening at this point. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=269.96000000000004s)]
*  I mean, we can talk about why these spaces are so large. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=272.96000000000004s)]
*  And what they tell us about the economics, et cetera. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=275.96s)]
*  But at least in terms of the tactical and military conversation, we're seeing basically [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=280.96s)]
*  self-defense zones defending themselves against an Israeli military that is attempting to kill [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=287.96s)]
*  them. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=293.96s)]
*  Yeah, let's talk about why they've reappeared in Israel. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=294.96s)]
*  Let's talk about why they've reappeared in especially areas in the Northern West Bank, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=300.96s)]
*  in Jenin and in Nablus, where the lion's den is located and is defending the communities there. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=307.96s)]
*  You know, especially like in terms of the lack of real defense by the Palestinian authority, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=315.96s)]
*  which is supposed to be in charge of defending Palestinians in the West Bank. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=323.96s)]
*  But as we all know, the Palestinian authority has remained basically a subcontractor of the Israeli [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=329.96s)]
*  occupation. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=337.96s)]
*  In the last week or so, we saw the PA announce that it would be pausing its so-called security [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=338.96s)]
*  coordination with Israel. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=347.96s)]
*  They've said that before, and of course, no pause happened. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=348.96s)]
*  Can you talk about what it really is, the role of the Palestinian authority and how [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=356.96s)]
*  that fits into the context of what we're seeing with the lion's den, for example, other resistance [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=362.96s)]
*  factions really stepping in to provide civilian defense? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=370.96s)]
*  I mean, it's a long story, but to make it short, I mean, I think the PA is central to all of this. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=376.96s)]
*  The PA, since 2006, because in the second Intifada, it was basically mostly destroyed as at least an [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=383.96s)]
*  institutional existence and was resurrected in an attempt to provide, again, the Israelis with the [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=391.96s)]
*  power to expand in terms of territorial settlement expansion, et cetera, while the PA handles the [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=399.96s)]
*  people, the Palestinian people living in the West Bank specifically, excluding Jerusalem, of course. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=405.96s)]
*  So in this sense, what we had is this kind of dual role where you have a military occupation that [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=411.96s)]
*  enables settlement expansion and a PA which deals with the people, civil issues, security coordination, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=417.96s)]
*  and other realm. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=424.96s)]
*  But the PA has almost always sold the Palestinians a very ideological stance that this current situation is [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=425.96s)]
*  only temporary, that it's working towards a realization of a state and that its realization of the state is [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=433.96s)]
*  built on the strategy of legal international lawfare, that it's built on pressuring the US to interfere [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=441.96s)]
*  in the conflict by proving their ability to maintain security on the ground. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=453.96s)]
*  The idea was that eventually the Europeans and Americans will come in and give us a state, and that never [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=459.96s)]
*  really, no, I mean, since 2012, the EU, the UN, a lot of international organizations declared Palestine [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=465.96s)]
*  ready to become a state, but the state never actually born food. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=474.96s)]
*  So you have the situation where it's basic ideological premise that it sells to the people basically [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=478.96s)]
*  is crumbling. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=484.96s)]
*  Therefore, we're seeing this kind of unbinding process, if you want, from the PA, even among [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=485.96s)]
*  Fatah caters who are somewhat tied to the PA, at least present or represent the social base on which the [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=491.96s)]
*  PA relies to maintain its control, its social power in society. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=499.96s)]
*  And particularly the north of the West Bank, beyond its long history of resistance to the Israelis [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=504.96s)]
*  and the Zionist colonization, I mean, it goes back before 48, beyond that memory of resistance that plays [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=511.96s)]
*  a role in its resurgence today, has not been really essential part of PA planning, economic development, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=519.96s)]
*  institutional building. So you also have this kind of neglect that are also, you know, have a lot of [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=529.96s)]
*  social antagonisms about how the PA dealt with its, you know, placing Ramallah as a central place for its [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=536.96s)]
*  existence, where all the ministries are, where most of its developmental aid goes to, and actually drawing a [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=542.96s)]
*  lot of people from areas like Jenin and Nablus to work into Ramallah. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=549.96s)]
*  So actually the people who might serve as, let's say, an echo of PA ideology in the north of the West Bank [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=554.96s)]
*  are mostly living in Ramallah, which means that we can see the north of the West Bank as one of the areas [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=563.96s)]
*  where PA ideological power, social presence is the weakest. And therefore it provides under the current [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=570.96s)]
*  situation on the ground, the pretext for why a lot of these new movements are rising and, you know, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=580.96s)]
*  holding arms, developing the self-defense strategy that I talked about. I mean, it goes also to the presence of [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=588.96s)]
*  other Palestinian militant group like the Islamic Jihad, Hamas, people who are in Fatah but are unhappy about [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=598.96s)]
*  the current leadership or other parts of Palestinian political parties that are basically pushing for a new [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=606.96s)]
*  configuration and new presence on the ground, one that is built generally speaking on a new generation of [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=615.96s)]
*  Palestinians, people from 18 to 35 who are willing to take up arms and who are presenting or representing [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=621.96s)]
*  this kind of new spirit of resistance in different ways. We can also talk about that later, but at least my [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=628.96s)]
*  reading is that the north of the West Bank seems a logical place for such a resistance in its current form as a [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=635.96s)]
*  self-defense zone. I mean, because remember resistance that exists everywhere else, but it takes just different forms. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=644.96s)]
*  But in the north of the West Bank, it's one of these places where the social marginalization of these places, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=652.96s)]
*  including the ideological unbinding from the PA, but also a hugely important point, which is the existence of a lot of refugee camps, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=661.96s)]
*  old cities, and these are very narrow spaces or cramped spaces if you want, which enable the development of like a [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=671.96s)]
*  self-defense, civilians, armed and capable of engagement, military engagement with the Israeli army. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=681.96s)]
*  So, I mean, these cramped spaces are the hot resistance right now because they present like a cover, a social, but also an urban cover [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=690.96s)]
*  for these resistance fighters who are attempting this kind of self-defense zone making in the north of the West Bank. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=700.96s)]
*  Right. And consequently, Israel is doing, I mean, the massacre that happened in Jenin just a few weeks ago, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=707.96s)]
*  where Israeli jets were dropping missiles on Jenin, which hasn't happened for more than a decade and a half. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=718.96s)]
*  The reaction by the Israeli apartheid government and also the PA has been pretty vicious. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=730.96s)]
*  And what happens during a massacre like that? What is the intention of Israel? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=744.96s)]
*  And how is the resistance, you know, maintaining despite all of these attacks against it? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=753.96s)]
*  I mean, what enables resistance is this like position that the resistance fighter is taking in the Palestinian context right now. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=763.96s)]
*  I mean, what we see with this new generation is this unwillingness to actually surrender or negotiate. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=773.96s)]
*  I mean, it does happen sometimes, but mostly they're or unafraid of that. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=779.96s)]
*  They have this wager with death. They accept that they might die. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=786.96s)]
*  They accept this probability. And that's what makes them very sub and perhaps revolutionary, you know, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=791.96s)]
*  like because this kind of acceptance of this makes them outside the ability of Israeli power to enact itself. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=797.96s)]
*  So the intensity of violence actually represents Israel losing control. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=804.96s)]
*  It doesn't represent Israel actually maintaining control. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=808.96s)]
*  I mean, to retain control, it uses this, you know, Israeli power, air power and discussions over how to tactically kill these groups, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=811.96s)]
*  intelligence information on these groups, special forces and the use of it, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=822.96s)]
*  whether there should be a large scale military operation or whether they should just sustain this kind of like pressure on these groups by creating like, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=827.96s)]
*  you know, a special type of operations that they enter refugee camps or the old city in Nablus, you know, targeting a specific, let's say, cell and then they leave. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=838.96s)]
*  The Israelis are attempting different mix of tactics. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=854.96s)]
*  But what is essential here is that for the first time, at least in 16 years, you have hundreds of Palestinians, if not more, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=858.96s)]
*  and a surrounding environment that accepts this wager with death. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=868.96s)]
*  And that's why that, you know, you see Israelis acting the way they act. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=873.96s)]
*  I think it also has reasons with Israeli mentality when it comes to like enacting military operations. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=879.96s)]
*  They don't want to lose any soldier. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=884.96s)]
*  They want to go in without having anybody killed. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=886.96s)]
*  So they enact operations where they use heavy fire, have heavy firepower. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=890.96s)]
*  Remember, most of these fighters didn't ever actually kill an Israeli, didn't ever actually commit operations that actually led to any Israeli death. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=895.96s)]
*  But despite that, they're treated with this kind of heavy handed military, you know, and security mentality by the Israelis. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=908.96s)]
*  This is assistance in Israel, like protecting its soldiers means that when they enter in any area, they're willing to use firepower, mostly indiscriminate. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=918.96s)]
*  And it leads to these to what happened a week ago or 10 days ago, in Jenin of 10 people being killed in one operation and a lot of other people being injured severely, etc. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=929.96s)]
*  So this is the problem. This is the dynamic that is happening. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=942.96s)]
*  I think, you know, historically, Israel has lost some of its, let's say, you know, heroism, its capability of entering areas, land areas. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=945.96s)]
*  There's an Israeli insecurity about this, you know, in Lebanon, they were defeated in Gaza, it wasn't easy. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=960.96s)]
*  And therefore, this type of heavy handed approach policy comes also from this long history of actually meeting resistance fighters in Lebanon, Gaza and other places and being defeated on the ground. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=966.96s)]
*  So I mean, this reliance on like firepower, on air power is partially the result of this failure of this historical failure. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=979.96s)]
*  So they're using their technologies, their good intelligence, special operations, go in and out without any injuries on their soldiers and therefore they're willing to commit whatever is necessary to do that. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=989.96s)]
*  Right. I mean, they thought that they had successfully quelled the resistance in the West Bank, you know, for the last 16, 17 years. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1006.96s)]
*  Can you talk about the this new generation of fighters that you mentioned and and how these factions are emerging with with, you know, relative success at this at this point? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1017.96s)]
*  I mean, yeah, I mean, there's a lot of the in about, you know, how you can measure success because success always is like a very, let's say, instrumental rationalist type of like thinking, no. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1035.96s)]
*  It comes to the rise of this new generation, I think, and this is actually an Israeli reading. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1047.96s)]
*  The Israelis read this as this is a generational fighter. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1054.96s)]
*  We have a new generation of Palestinians. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1058.96s)]
*  These guys are not scared to die, and we need to remind them of Israeli power and we need to remind them of what Israel could do. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1060.96s)]
*  We need to create yet another trauma and and and therefore, again, this goes back to our earlier question of why the use of, you know, firepower in the way Israel is using. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1067.96s)]
*  I mean, this new generation of Palestinians that has not been a witness to the second Intifada or the first Intifada has not been truly arrested or gone through the motions of warning or gone through the motions of interrogations in Israeli prisons. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1082.96s)]
*  This new fresh, if we want to say, generation of people that, you know, they that has this like will to power will to engage the Israel meter need to be reminded of Israel's power of Israel's military capabilities of intelligence of Israel's ability to kill to choose who to kill to choose who not to kill. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1098.96s)]
*  And therefore you see this kind of like also enactment of trauma on the, you know, why Israelis are, you know, excessively using firepower and not only in Geneva Nablus actually all over, you know, the West Bank because they're reading it somewhat as a generational fight that they need to win. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1120.96s)]
*  They need to make sure that this new generation of Palestinians also understand that they cannot be successful, that they cannot challenge Israel's power in the West Bank, that they cannot make a difference and and therefore this excessive use of killing arrest, etc. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1142.96s)]
*  And I mean if you look at the last year the policy has been an expansion of arrests, even what is called in Israel like you know, attention was as a form of preventive arrest. It's attempting to kill any form of political leadership arising around this form of struggle by you know, choosing [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1160.96s)]
*  people who they think might provide, you know, the infrastructure for the rise of a new leadership, a leadership that could prove an alternative to the current PA leadership and the class interests it represents. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1180.96s)]
*  So at this moment, the Israeli strategy of containment and of maintaining pressure on the self defense zones of these new spaces of resistance and attempting to close you know the wall at the beginning of the year, make sure the security walls actually security [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1193.96s)]
*  like that no Palestinian could enter into the heart of the settlement in 1948. This whole policy that they see it as something that is going to escalate, as something that is going to you know, roll on in the next couple of months, even years. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1210.96s)]
*  And therefore they need to be ready and and and therefore they're kind of like you know, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1230.96s)]
*  trying to eat Palestinians for lunch before Palestinians eat them for dinner. I mean that's the logic, you know, I'm not sure if it's going to work because they're also creating the space and escalation in the conflict. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1238.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1254.96s)]
*  I would have my part of part of this like, you know, this, this escalation of violence is, I mean it's part and parcel of like what a settler colony does, you know deputizes its citizens to be to be part of the, you know, security apparatus. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1256.96s)]
*  We see this now just in the, in the last week. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1279.96s)]
*  The Israeli government announced that it would be expanding licenses for personal firearms for Israeli settlers. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1283.96s)]
*  You know, and this is, I actually was surprised I didn't think there were many licenses to begin with or, you know, or restrictions on like how many firearms Israelis can carry. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1292.96s)]
*  But what is the signify in terms of like national and political policy with this new Israeli government and and what could be the result of like the the escalation of literal firearms in the hands of Israeli settlers. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1304.96s)]
*  It's actually ironic because in many cases where they expanded the existence of firepower you saw Israelis killing Israelis know, I mean, and mistaking. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1320.96s)]
*  You know, another. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1331.96s)]
*  You know, Israeli society is also like conflicted it has different ethnicities and groups and you know, a Yemenite Jew or, you know, as far as I think Jew is different than Ashkenazi and, and this creates a lot of different problems and it happened actually repeatedly, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1333.96s)]
*  where, you know, this fear of the rise of let's say another form of resistance in the past couple of years which was based on what is called in like, let's say military, like the lone wolf phenomenon. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1348.96s)]
*  I mean, I think it's a it's a wrong description of this phenomenon. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1362.96s)]
*  But what's happening is that beyond these self defense zones. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1366.96s)]
*  And this is what happened after Jeanine. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1371.96s)]
*  You saw operations happening in the heart of Jerusalem know in East Jerusalem, the settlement of your Navy are coven and other places. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1374.96s)]
*  So Israelis in their war in the north of the West Bank are getting also, you know, attacks by Palestinians in the south of, you know, in the negative in the heart of Tel Aviv in Jerusalem, in other places and one of the most important elements of that is that they cannot actually [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1382.96s)]
*  actually predict that intelligence doesn't work here, you know, because it's not an organized phenomenon, it's not actually have, you know, predictive capacity or infiltrate a specific group or understand the specific, you know, organization and its network of operations. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1404.96s)]
*  It's somebody who has the will to go and act, you know, an operation and Israel just doesn't have a real response for that. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1420.96s)]
*  So you see this kind of like, you know, spiraling of different policies, where Israel is trying to maintain what it calls her time Hebrew or, or what is it called, you know, deterrence, you know, so, you know, if somebody attacks Israelis or settlements or settlers or, or soldiers. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1429.96s)]
*  We're gonna like kidnap his body. That's the first thing we're gonna make his family pay a price you know, a very tribal approach as well, you know, you killed one of us so we're gonna like make your family hurt it's also something that is under international law you know, rejected under any law actually is also collective punishment right like the punishment. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1450.96s)]
*  Closing or destroying somebody's house. Now they're talking about maybe deporting people or doing other type of stuff, increasing the presence of what you just said, you know, and licenses for guns. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1475.96s)]
*  So this kind of like this kind of spiraling of policy of trying to maintain like some sort of deterrence, despite its failure historically despite that it didn't really actually create the deterrence that they wanted to create means they're in a very hard position. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1489.96s)]
*  It means that they're, you know, they don't really know what they don't really know how to solve this problem they don't really know how to solve this phenomenon. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1508.96s)]
*  And, and, and that shows a, you know, the weakness of the currents. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1515.96s)]
*  Israeli mentality of dealing with the Palestinian issue, only on a security military basis. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1522.96s)]
*  So, it's not a political issue with just a security issue. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1528.96s)]
*  And, and they can enact whatever security issue they want. But as we see over and over again, throughout the history of passing confrontation with Israeli colonialism since the first Zionist sector came in resistance has just a way of coming back in different forms in [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1532.96s)]
*  different generations, different Palestinians, and it has a way of, you know, of exploiting these type of weaknesses, even on the level of what we just said, this lone wolf phenomenon that that and they have no real answer to. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1553.96s)]
*  Finally, let's talk a little bit about, you know, how, how you're seeing the situation kind of unfolding, I know it's, it's impossible to predict or to speculate. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1573.96s)]
*  But, you know, based on what we're seeing with, you know, as we mentioned, like the resurgence of these West Bank factions with Gaza, continuing to be, you know, a pretty strong force against Israeli colonization. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1588.96s)]
*  And with this new generation, being willing to fight. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1606.96s)]
*  How do you see the, you know, also and and with the Palestinian Authority in the state that it is, you know, continuing to sell out, continuing to work with Israel and the EU and US and Canada. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1612.96s)]
*  How do you see the situation playing out as you know as best as best you can predict at this point. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1627.96s)]
*  I think this is the, this is the problem of the space that we are in historically it's it's one where, you know, you see resistance resurgent, but you don't see, at least in current discourse around resistance and even among the resistance by themselves or among the wider society. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1634.96s)]
*  A sort of futurity like some, we can actually build on. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1654.96s)]
*  Where does this lead us, you know, what is possible politically to achieve. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1659.96s)]
*  So this is one of the problems of fighting in the current moment and this is why I think it's also like one of these unique moments that people are fighting despite the fact that these large scale narrative of retaining Palestine or liberation or, you know, it's, it's, it's, you know, these type of, you know, metanarratives [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1666.96s)]
*  have, you know, have lost their capacity and power to ignite people's imagination. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1686.96s)]
*  Remember that, you know, there is that one of the, you know, we can read resistance currently developing as a symptom of PA weakness, you know, on a social level on an economic level on an ideological level, but it still retains a lot of its power. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1694.96s)]
*  As two things going on for it. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1712.96s)]
*  The incapacity of Palestinians to think of an alternative to the PA. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1717.96s)]
*  It's a it's a very crippling. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1722.96s)]
*  We just don't have an answer, a concrete answer of what to do if the PA doesn't exist anymore, specifically on an economic level specifically because it, it employs 32% of the Palestinian workforce. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1724.96s)]
*  And this type of economic power and incapacity to think of an alternative [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1742.96s)]
*  is quite crippling on a political level. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1749.96s)]
*  What do you do without the PA? How would you organize society without the PA? I mean, this is one of the elements that makes this moment a moment where I think we're going to see kind of resistance coexisting with another form of, you know, continuity in the, in the, in the [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1752.96s)]
*  the current, you know, horizon of a consumer society that has malls in Palestine of day to day life that people are basically clinging on a sense of like clinging to the PA because at least we can survive Israeli power. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1773.96s)]
*  And you can see it in order because I mean, even the PA discourse coming from its leaders, justifying security coordination at this moment is one where it says like, look, security coordination protects you from Israeli debt, protects you from Israeli power, protects you from Israeli ability to go crazy.

*  And this is something where what we can do is only cooperate with the enemy to maintain our bare existence, you know, and this is something, this is also a form of ideological power that maintains the PA, you know, but still there's a process of unbinding happening, a process where people are rejecting that, a process that we can see, you know, becoming material in terms of like the rise of resisting groups and their power. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1813.96s)]
*  So I see them kind of coexisting together. I see resistance and the day to day life moving on, at least for the moment. I don't see Intifada in the way we saw it historically in this first Intifada or even in the second Intifada. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1842.96s)]
*  I see a reluctance among people to go all in, you know, but I see also a willingness of these that the return of this capacity to act in the world, this capacity to resist, what will it actually lead to? [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1859.96s)]
*  So I think this is the type of like, you know, scenario that I see at least for the next couple of months or the next year or so. I mean, but you know, anything could happen, you know, predicting the future is always, you know, something. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1879.96s)]
*  You have to go with caution on that one. Yeah, of course. Especially in Palestine, things can change in an instant. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1895.96s)]
*  I mean, but it also doesn't mean that we don't have, you know, these flashes, you know, this spontaneous rise of like large scale rebellions. But the problem is how do you sustain them? That's a different question. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1904.96s)]
*  They could rise, but they could also, you know, easily fade away. I mean, and I see that also reappearing, but I don't see it necessarily being able to fade itself in a very, you know, uniform way, in a different rhythm. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1920.96s)]
*  But I think things have been since 2012, you know, in 2012, there was not a single operation or Israeli killed or injured in a single operation coming from the West Bank the whole year. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1936.96s)]
*  You know, it was one of the quietest years in the history of the Israeli occupation from the eyes of, let's say, Israeli intelligence and Israeli military and Israeli security establishment. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1948.96s)]
*  And since 2012, we have this slow but intensifying resurgence of resistance in different forms, you know, in terms of demonstrations, large scale rebellions in Jerusalem, within even 1948, among 1948 Palestinians, and also in the West Bank taking these varied forms. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1960.96s)]
*  And it's rapidly increasing. The PA is losing power every day. It's infighting is also making it even weaker. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1985.96s)]
*  But still, I still think that the PA is more powerful than people give it, you know, give it credence. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=1995.96s)]
*  It has this economic power. It has this binding power to it, and it has this capacity to make us not think of an alternative to it. So this is one of the problems that we have on at least on a political level. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=2006.96s)]
*  How can we fill, you know, our imagination? What could we do politically? What is possible? [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=2020.96s)]
*  There's still something that nobody can really answer. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmYklEAFfN8&t=2027.96s)]
*  I think that's a good place to leave it. Abdeljawad Hamayel, you are a PhD student and a lecturer at Beer's Eight University in the West Bank in Palestine. We'd love to have you on again.
