# Weaponizing anti-Semitism, with Ali Abunimah and Asa Winstanley | EI Podcast
**The Electronic Intifada:** [June 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs)
*  And this is a weapon that the Israel lobby has given the right, given the right around [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=0.0s)]
*  the world and it's such a useful weapon that it won't ever be abandoned. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=14.6s)]
*  It's going to be used over and over again. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=18.6s)]
*  It can't be swept under it will never go away. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=20.68s)]
*  It can only be defeated. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  The electronic intifada. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=24.96s)]
*  The electronic intifada. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=25.96s)]
*  The electronic intifada. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=26.96s)]
*  This is the electronic intifada podcast. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=28.96s)]
*  I'm Nora Barrows Friedman. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=31.96s)]
*  And I'm Asa Winstanley. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=34.24s)]
*  Welcome back to the electronic intifada podcast. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=40.64s)]
*  Today our executive director Ali Abunimah is here to co-host the episode and we have a [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=43.56s)]
*  very special guest, our colleague and this podcast co-host Asa Winstanley. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=48.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's great to be a guest for once. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it's a nice little role reversal. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=56.279999999999994s)]
*  I love it. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=58.28s)]
*  Asa has a brand new book out, Weaponizing Anti-Semitism. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=59.28s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=63.28s)]
*  How the Israel lobby brought down Jeremy Corbyn, which is a culmination of the investigative [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=65.88s)]
*  work Asa has been known for into the campaign to sabotage Jeremy Corbyn with a ton of new [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=70.8s)]
*  details and the kind of sharp analysis that has made him the preeminent expert on this [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=76.64s)]
*  story. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=81.68s)]
*  We are so proud of you Asa. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=82.68s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=83.68s)]
*  I'm already blushing guys. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=85.24000000000001s)]
*  Well, I'll just say, first of all, it's a role reversal for me because now I'm the co-host [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=88.24000000000001s)]
*  and I don't know how to do that very well. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=96.56s)]
*  But I'll be fine. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=98.52000000000001s)]
*  Well, thank you. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=100.52000000000001s)]
*  But it's wonderful to have to have this conversation. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=102.0s)]
*  First Asa, congratulations. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=106.64000000000001s)]
*  I've just finished reading the book. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=109.28s)]
*  Actually, I'm lying. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=111.16000000000001s)]
*  I've got like less than a chapter left and I was trying to finish it before the podcast [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=112.64s)]
*  and I can't wait to get back to it because honestly, it's a page turner. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=118.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=123.28s)]
*  And I'm not surprised because you're a fantastic storyteller. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=124.28s)]
*  But I was a little bit surprised because I know this story. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=130.08s)]
*  You know, I've obviously edited many of your stories on the labor anti-Semitism crisis [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=135.16s)]
*  over what has it been now? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=142.48s)]
*  Eight years? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=144.0s)]
*  Yeah, eight years. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=145.0s)]
*  And so you'd think I know the story inside out, probably second only to you. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=146.67999999999998s)]
*  But I was learning new things every day on almost every page. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=154.6s)]
*  And the way you brought it together as a story, really just telling the story, almost like [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=160.72s)]
*  a novel in a way and really making it accessible for everyone. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=168.72s)]
*  And I don't want to preempt our discussion, but I want to say it's such an important story, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=174.96s)]
*  Asa, because this was, I mean, this was the sabotage of one of supposedly the world's [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=180.88s)]
*  most established democracies. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=192.4s)]
*  Britain boasts that it's the world's oldest parliamentary democracy and a lobby for a [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=194.23999999999998s)]
*  foreign state managed to subvert the democracy of the UK. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=203.6s)]
*  I don't, I mean, this is my opinion. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=209.12s)]
*  People could disagree with it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=211.76s)]
*  But I think that if the Israel lobby had not waged this campaign of lies, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=213.44s)]
*  Jeremy Corbyn would have been prime minister. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=220.48s)]
*  And if that had happened, it would have had a profound political effect, I think, not just [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=224.16s)]
*  in the UK, but across Europe and perhaps around the world. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=230.48000000000002s)]
*  So congratulations, because you've told a monumental story with global relevance in a [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=235.12s)]
*  way that is just a joy to read. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=245.2s)]
*  And we're very, very proud of you. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=247.92s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=249.92s)]
*  And I think we can end the podcast. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=251.11999999999998s)]
*  I guess that's it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=254.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=255.6s)]
*  Well done. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=257.92s)]
*  Well, thanks for saying all that. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=258.48s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of people, a lot of the first reactions I've had of people have said that [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=262.71999999999997s)]
*  I've had a similar experience to you, people who know the story, people who [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=267.68s)]
*  I've been on podcasts with over the last couple of weeks, people at the book launch who [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=272.8s)]
*  are in the book who have said to me, like Jackie Walker said to me, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=278.88s)]
*  you know, I thought I knew this story, but there was a lot that I didn't realize. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=282.88s)]
*  And, you know, I'm not trying to be falsely modest, but, you know, when you, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=287.52s)]
*  I had the same experience when I sat down to write the book, because a lot of it was [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=294.64s)]
*  drawing on my reporting, our reporting over the last eight years. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=301.6s)]
*  But when I came to string it all together into a coherent narrative, there was a lot [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=307.6s)]
*  that I realized and a lot that you just add in and you realize, yes, this is significant. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=311.12s)]
*  When you look at the individual pieces over the years, you don't necessarily [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=317.84000000000003s)]
*  see the whole until you put it all together. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=321.52000000000004s)]
*  And I think we're at this moment where this lesson has to be learned, you know, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=324.72s)]
*  and the British left, unfortunately, I mean, I would say the majority of [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=330.32s)]
*  certainly the publicly facing British left or the official British left is adamantly [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=335.44s)]
*  refusing to learn the lessons of this. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=340.48s)]
*  They're still in deep denial about what happened, I would say. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=342.4s)]
*  And you summed it up there really well, Annie, that, you know, and even, I mean, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=346.56s)]
*  even among some friendly people, people responses to the book, there is this debate of, well, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=352.0s)]
*  was it really the anti-Semitism smears? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=360.0s)]
*  Of course, the friendly people accept that there was, it played a major role, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=363.2s)]
*  but there's this debate over whether it was Brexit or it was anti-Semitism, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=367.68s)]
*  the anti-Semitism smears that played the key role. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=373.84s)]
*  And I think it's kind of, kind of doesn't really matter because I think that's the key point is [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=376.64s)]
*  what you said, Ali, that if Israel hadn't done this, Israel, the state of Israel and its lobby [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=381.36s)]
*  hadn't done this or hadn't been allowed to do this, hadn't been able to do this [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=388.72s)]
*  politically for whatever reason, it is highly likely that Jeremy Corbyn would have been [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=392.40000000000003s)]
*  prime minister, you know, whether he would have lasted long is another question, but [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=398.08s)]
*  at least he wouldn't have been able to have a shot at it. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=403.04s)]
*  I think that's absolutely true. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=405.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=407.36s)]
*  But I think for those who don't know sort of all the political history that well, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=407.92s)]
*  the Brexit vote happened in 2016. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=415.35999999999996s)]
*  And then there was a UK general election in 2017 when Jeremy Corbyn was still leader of the Labour [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=419.67999999999995s)]
*  Party. And at that election, the Labour Party got its highest share of the vote in decades and had [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=428.15999999999997s)]
*  actually gained seats when everyone expected it would be a disaster. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=440.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=448.0s)]
*  And Theresa May, who was the Conservative Prime Minister at the time, had called the election [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=448.72s)]
*  thinking that she would be able to increase her majority. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=455.52s)]
*  And in fact, she lost it. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=458.4s)]
*  And so the reason I'm saying that is not to get down into the weeds too much. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=460.88s)]
*  But the point is that in 2017, Jeremy Corbyn had already been the target of two years of relentless [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=466.56s)]
*  anti-Semitism smears and right-wing coup attempts within the Labour Party. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=478.08s)]
*  Internal sabotage. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=484.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=486.32s)]
*  Internal sabotage. The whole of the British press were against him. You know, all of the [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=486.64s)]
*  mainstream press, the government media, the BBC were against him. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=493.12s)]
*  And yet that's how close he came to pulling off a stunning victory while increasing the Labour [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=498.16s)]
*  share of the vote under Tony Blair, who is still remembered by some as this political genius, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=507.04s)]
*  a la Bill Clinton, who sort of turned the fortunes of the Labour Party around, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=513.28s)]
*  you know, from the in the 1990s and won power. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=519.36s)]
*  Tony Blair won in a landslide in 1997, but the Labour Party lost votes every single election [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=524.72s)]
*  from 1997, including under Tony Blair and then Gordon Brown and then who came after Gordon Brown. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=534.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, these people are so forgettable. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=544.0s)]
*  And Jeremy Corbyn increased Labour's share of the vote by this historic margin. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=546.88s)]
*  He brought hundreds of thousands of new people, particularly young, energised people, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=555.36s)]
*  into the Labour Party. And he almost won despite being the target of this smear campaign. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=561.4399999999999s)]
*  So that's why I think it's it's fair to say he would have won had had they not done this, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=569.9200000000001s)]
*  because he didn't need that much more. Yeah. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=577.44s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know if you think about that. I'm sitting thousands of miles away from [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=581.84s)]
*  the UK. So but that's my reading. Yeah, no, I absolutely agree with that, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=586.08s)]
*  because I think that it was so close. You know, it was only there was one study which showed that he [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=591.6800000000001s)]
*  came within a few thousand votes of becoming prime minister in 2017. You know, it would have [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=598.4s)]
*  been probably a hung parliament. It would have been had to have been some sort of coalition. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=605.36s)]
*  And it would have been difficult to manage, but he could have done it. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=611.68s)]
*  I mean, even so we're dealing in hypotheticals. But if there hadn't been this internal sabotage [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=614.8s)]
*  campaign, if Jeremy Corbyn had had more ruthless advisors around him, or if he'd allowed [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=622.24s)]
*  people like Ken Livingston and Chris Williamson are free arraying to be enforcers, while he's [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=628.64s)]
*  still carried on being the nice, friendly person that he is, and kick out all these saboteurs from [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=633.1999999999999s)]
*  the Labour Party, then you know, they wouldn't have been able to do the job that they did [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=639.12s)]
*  in coordination with the state of Israel. You know, this is a really, it's a really important [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=647.28s)]
*  thing, which I tried to bring out in the book. I mean, and I think that is something that is [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=651.68s)]
*  really being underplayed, you know, it is sabotage from a hostile foreign power. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=658.32s)]
*  At the end of the day, that's that is that is what it was. It was a hostile foreign power. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=665.2s)]
*  Yes, of course, Britain is supposed to supposedly a friendly nation to Israel is supposedly a [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=670.08s)]
*  friendly nation to the state to to Britain. But it was certainly hostile foreign power to the [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=675.6s)]
*  Labour Party and to Jeremy Corbyn. And we saw in the others, I mean, I have a whole chapter dedicated [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=681.44s)]
*  to it in the book, as you know, that we saw in those Al Jazeera documentaries in 2017. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=687.36s)]
*  And 2018, the the way the Israel lobby works closely together with the actual state of Israel, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=694.8000000000001s)]
*  and they do so in very, very deceptive fashion. You know, they they they do it through front [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=704.0s)]
*  groups, they do it through cutouts. And they do it even worse, they present themselves as the [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=710.32s)]
*  Jewish community. Right. They present themselves and they claim to represent the Jewish community. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=716.08s)]
*  So it's a real kind of dangerous sectarian educate agitation in that respect. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=720.96s)]
*  Yeah, you mentioned Jackie Walker at the beginning. I mean, you know, can you talk about her as an [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=727.12s)]
*  example of how the the Israel lobby saboteurs that that were able to to infiltrate and influence the [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=733.36s)]
*  Labour Party went after Jewish anti Zionists, calling them anti Semites and lumping them in [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=744.56s)]
*  with, you know, it's it's it's absolutely I mean, it's stunning. When you think about it, and how [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=753.52s)]
*  you talk about it in the book, it's really like a true crime thriller, you know. But this was the [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=759.5999999999999s)]
*  tactic that they employed and it worked. Talk a little bit about how, you know, how that kind of [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=766.64s)]
*  the efficacy of that sabotage tactic and how it has played out, not just in the UK, but we're seeing [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=776.24s)]
*  it, of course, across the US and Canada, elsewhere. Yes, it's been put into operation all over the [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=783.84s)]
*  Western nations, really. So Jackie Walker is a black woman. She's a black woman who is of [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=792.16s)]
*  also of Jewish heritage on both sides of her family. And she was and is an anti racist educator, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=801.36s)]
*  an author, you know, she wrote a memoir some years ago. She is was like a lot of people, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=814.4s)]
*  someone on the left of the Labour Party who was either rejoined or was newly reinvigorated [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=823.52s)]
*  in the Labour Party when Jeremy Corbyn became the leader of the Labour Party in 2015, because there [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=833.84s)]
*  was this nobody expected it. And it was a kind of semi spontaneous, popular movement to get [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=838.88s)]
*  Jeremy Corbyn elected to be the leader of the Labour Party. And there was, you know, there was [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=847.76s)]
*  a lot of enthusiasm, there was a lot of hope. You know, I remember it was really kind of cringe, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=854.96s)]
*  but there was in 2015, I remember there was this poster that had Jeremy Corbyn in the colours of [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=860.48s)]
*  the old Obama poster that said hope. It was really kind of cringe, but there was hope, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=866.88s)]
*  there was hope, you know, and it was like, well, actually, this, unlike Obama, Jeremy Corbyn is [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=875.28s)]
*  actually, he does have good politics. And he was always someone who in the years when like, I hated [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=880.0s)]
*  the Labour Party, because it was the party of war, it was the party of invading Iraq, it was a party [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=886.24s)]
*  of Tony Blair, it was a party of privatisation. There would always be one or two Labour MPs around [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=890.88s)]
*  these movements, around the anti war movement, around the Palestine Solidarity Movement. And [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=897.4399999999999s)]
*  there was just a very small number of them. And it was always Jeremy Corbyn, Diane Abbott, and a [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=902.56s)]
*  couple of others. And those are the people who you thought, okay, well, you know, the Labour Party is [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=907.12s)]
*  terrible, but there's one or two people in it who are okay. And so, you know, because he was not [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=911.84s)]
*  a career politician, he didn't have any kind of ambitions to be one of these drones in suits, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=919.28s)]
*  who these corporates drones who went from this poisonous right wing student politics, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=927.76s)]
*  quite often into the new Labour Party, and then just saw themselves as entitled to run the [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=934.9599999999999s)]
*  the country and the world really, he was the polar opposite of that, you know, he was this rebel [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=941.92s)]
*  from war time. And that, you know, always voting against Tony Blair, voting against the war, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=948.8s)]
*  voting against privatisation, all these things, there was just a lot of hope. And so Jackie Walker [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=954.16s)]
*  was involved in trying to create a popular basis and a movement behind Jeremy Corbyn that could [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=959.68s)]
*  sustain him, because everyone could see from the beginning, he was going to be and he was being [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=968.0s)]
*  adamantly opposed by his own party, by the vast majority of his MPs, by the bureaucracy, by the [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=972.24s)]
*  apparatus by the by the Labour Party establishment, you know, they were, you know, they were never [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=980.16s)]
*  gonna accept it. I mean, I mentioned there's one phrase in the book that I'm quite proud of, which [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=985.76s)]
*  is that they were like the contras in suits, you know, that there was a kind of uprising, a kind of [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=990.96s)]
*  political revolution within the Labour Party from below from from outside the Labour Party, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=996.24s)]
*  or from partially from outside, partially from the membership base of the Labour Party. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1001.84s)]
*  And so there was a kind of Corbyn coming to the leadership of the party was a kind of political [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1007.6800000000001s)]
*  revolution in that way. And but of course, you know, the contras were never going to accept that. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1012.8000000000001s)]
*  And it reminded me a lot earlier of your work about I think we even had conversations of it [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1020.5600000000001s)]
*  this at the time if memory serves that your work on the Palestine papers and the Gaza coup [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1027.04s)]
*  of how, you know, different, a lot of differences, different politics and so forth. But [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1032.48s)]
*  there was a kind of there was a kind of popular support for Hamas within Palestine within the [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1038.08s)]
*  West Bank. I remember I mean, I was in the West Bank in in 2006. I remember very secular people [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1044.3999999999999s)]
*  saying, Well, you know, Hamas, Hamas is resistance, Hamas is armed resistance to Israel, they should [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1049.84s)]
*  get a chance to govern the PA, you know, but FETA backed by the US backed by Israel, never accepted [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1055.36s)]
*  that. And I remember you calling them the Palestinian contras on democracy now way back when [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1063.6s)]
*  democracy now used to invite you on. And so, you know, these kinds of these kind of Labour MPs [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1068.8s)]
*  were the contras in suits where they were just not going to accept of course, you know, thankfully, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1076.1599999999999s)]
*  there was no guns involved, but there was very dirty politics going on. And it was all done in [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1080.56s)]
*  in a kind of unity with there's no other phrase for it really, but the British deep state and [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1088.0s)]
*  and with the Israel lobby and indirectly with the state of Israel. So you know, this this was a kind [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1095.28s)]
*  of really unholy Alliance that was carried out. And what happened was they picked off Jeremy's [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1102.0s)]
*  Corbyn supporters one by one his most high profile supporters one by one. And Jackie Walker was a [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1108.08s)]
*  was a relative was fairly early. One of those relatively high profile supporters who was picked [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1114.8799999999999s)]
*  off and who was attacked. And despite the fact that she, like I said, is of Jewish heritage on [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1121.84s)]
*  both sides of her family. You know, she's a mixed race woman, but the the white side and the black [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1127.12s)]
*  side, if you will both have Jewish heritage. She was made out to be this violent anti-Semite, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1132.96s)]
*  you know, and that was a pattern then that was repeated in different ways where, you know, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1139.92s)]
*  there's the chapter seven of the book, Jews and undue is where I talk about how [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1146.08s)]
*  Jewish supporters of Corbyn were really sort of de jude and the fact that they were ignored, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1152.08s)]
*  that their their their status as as Jewish people was often completely ignored by mainstream media [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1158.08s)]
*  reports, they would they would just be some comment taken out of context where they said, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1166.24s)]
*  oh, there's this terrible anti-Semitic comment that was made at Labour Party Conference by a [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1170.08s)]
*  supporter of Jeremy Corbyn. And they don't even mention the name of the person quite often, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1175.6s)]
*  because they would have a Jewish name, someone like Moshe Makover, who is actually an Israeli, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1180.32s)]
*  or I guess you could say former Israeli in a way. You know, he lives in London and so forth. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1186.56s)]
*  An Israeli dissident, certainly. And it wasn't even an anti-Semitic comment. It was an anti-Zionist [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1193.36s)]
*  comment, you know. You point out, Asa, in the book, this absurd situation that occurred again and [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1198.8799999999999s)]
*  again of Jewish grassroots activists, Jewish Palestine solidarity activists being accused of [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1207.6s)]
*  anti-Semitism by non-Jewish party officials, non-Jewish pundits. So completely absurd [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1217.1999999999998s)]
*  situation. I mean, it's just the mind boggles when it's the stuff we knew that was happening, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1226.7199999999998s)]
*  we were reporting on. But again, when you lay it all out in the book like that, it just sort of [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1233.84s)]
*  hits you again, how just poisonous this was. And you say, how did it happen? And there's this quite [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1239.1999999999998s)]
*  moving passage in the book where you compare the, and it's a comparison others have rightly made too, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1248.08s)]
*  because there was a group founded called Labour Against the Witch Hunt. It was a witch hunt. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1257.28s)]
*  And when we say witch hunt, what comes to mind? The Salem witch trials of the 17th century colonial [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1264.24s)]
*  America. And then of course, the McCarthyite period in the 1950s, which were linked by Arthur Miller's [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1273.12s)]
*  famous and fantastic play, The Crucible, which I think like many of us, I read in secondary school. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1280.8000000000002s)]
*  And it was a very profound book. It's one of those things that stuck with me all my life. And you [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1288.3200000000002s)]
*  have a, I don't know, maybe I can just read a couple of sentences that really stuck with me. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1295.6000000000001s)]
*  You say, yeah, you talk about how just the mere fact of being accused made you guilty. And denying [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1302.32s)]
*  and saying that accusations were false was further proof of your guilt. And you have this [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1313.04s)]
*  just a sentence, these two sentences, which are just the same. And you have a very, very [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1320.96s)]
*  further proof of your guilt. And you have this, this just a sentence, these two sentences that [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1327.68s)]
*  stuck with me. Confessing to the sin of witchcraft meant you are damned by your own word, but pleading [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1333.2s)]
*  your innocence also condemned you to death. It showed an unwillingness to repent to most grievous [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1339.92s)]
*  sin. There was no right answer. The starting point was always to assume the accusations were [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1345.8400000000001s)]
*  correct. Of course, that's in the context of the crucible of Arthur Miller's play, but that [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1352.56s)]
*  translates exactly to what was happening in the Labour Party. And you mentioned, we've talked about [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1358.1599999999999s)]
*  Jackie Miller, but another person you mentioned earlier that not everyone will know about is Ken [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1366.72s)]
*  Livingston. So Ken Livingston was a towering figure in the 1980s. He was elected the head of the [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1372.6399999999999s)]
*  London Council, the city government of London, and was so popular and so successful that [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1380.6399999999999s)]
*  Margaret Thatcher abolished the government of London to prevent Ken Livingston from [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1387.52s)]
*  winning elections. And by the way, he supported some really at the time unpopular causes that [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1394.8s)]
*  are now just considered mainstream. These terrible things like gay rights and equality for black and [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1402.3999999999999s)]
*  brown people and so forth, which he was constantly demonised for at the time, but now is just [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1408.8s)]
*  considered so mainstream that corporations are sort of endorsing it. And also, of course, he was in [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1413.6s)]
*  the forefront within the UK of the solidarity movement against apartheid in South Africa. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1421.12s)]
*  And at the time, I remember the BBC was very much part of this campaign against what was dubbed [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1429.36s)]
*  the loony left. In other words, these people like Ken Livingston with positions that are now [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1435.76s)]
*  considered mainstream were demonised in a very similar way to Jeremy Corbyn, but without so much [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1442.8s)]
*  the Israel factor coming in at that time. But then Ken Livingston, who, and then when [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1452.56s)]
*  the Tony Blair came in and they re-established a government for the [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1459.28s)]
*  city of London, Ken Livingston won again. He became mayor again, you know, however- [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1466.08s)]
*  As an independent, he had to rebel against Tony Blair because they've [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1471.12s)]
*  gerrymandered the internal election against him. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1475.36s)]
*  Right. So, I mean, my point is that Ken Livingston is a towering figure in Britain, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1478.32s)]
*  someone who was on the forefront of struggles against racism in solidarity with people [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1483.68s)]
*  struggling for rights that are considered fundamental now. And he was turned by the media, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1490.88s)]
*  by the Israel lobby into a Nazi, completely unjustly for stating the truth that there had been [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1498.88s)]
*  collaboration between Zionists and Nazis in the 1930s. And so you actually have to go into that [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1509.8400000000001s)]
*  to a certain extent in the book. And I have to say you do a brilliant job of kind of encapsulating [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1518.8000000000002s)]
*  that history of Zionist Nazi collaboration in a really meticulously documented but very digestible [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1526.16s)]
*  and readable way. I just wanted to put that out there. What do you think? I mean, [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1535.28s)]
*  did you think that you would have to sort of go back to the 1930s to be able to tell the story [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1541.6s)]
*  of what's happening now in the Labour Party? I think I planned that chapter quite early on [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1548.0s)]
*  from my in my earlier sketch of the book. But I remember at the time when it was all kicking [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1558.0s)]
*  off because in 2016 when there was this massive pressure on Corbyn and the Labour leadership at [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1566.64s)]
*  the time to ditch Ken Livingston and to expel him from the party and so forth. And he wasn't, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1574.64s)]
*  but he was suspended. And so, you know, this is the problem with social media, you know, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1584.24s)]
*  it has some benefits, but it can also lead to these kind of massive massive pylons and, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1592.32s)]
*  you know, it's hard to get out historical nuance and so forth. And I remember posting at the time, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1598.64s)]
*  well, what Ken Livingston said was right, you know, that our agreement is very well attested. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1603.44s)]
*  And I didn't know the full history of it, but I knew the basic outlines of it. And so when I came [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1608.96s)]
*  down to really do the book, I just I sat down and I read, I read most of Tom Sigev's book, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1615.2s)]
*  The Seventh Million, and I read that the book I rely on most in that chapter of my book is [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1621.1200000000001s)]
*  the The Third Reich and the Palestine Question, Francis Nicossia. And I did also read Lenny Brenner's [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1627.76s)]
*  book Zionism in the Age of the Dictators, although I relied on that less in the book. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1634.88s)]
*  I relied more on the Nicossia one because he's a historian who is, if not an outright Zionist, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1641.68s)]
*  he's certainly sympathetic to Zionism and he kind of ties himself in not really apologizing it for [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1650.0800000000002s)]
*  Zionism sometimes. But essentially, you know, none of that aside, the fact that he puts out in the [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1655.2800000000002s)]
*  book, I like, I just really undeniable, like there is this, there's, and I quote them in some [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1660.32s)]
*  detail in the book where I do just say, yeah, Ken Livingston was right. Hitler was supporting Zionism. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1665.9199999999998s)]
*  It is just, it's a fact, like it's there. And then other people say, well, you know, maybe you [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1673.52s)]
*  shouldn't have said it wasn't very diplomatic. Well, you know, that's okay, if that's your [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1680.24s)]
*  opinion, fine. But like, that's not really the point. Like he wasn't, he was being kicked out [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1686.08s)]
*  of the Labour Party. And in the end, he was basically forced to resign from the Labour Party. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1692.8799999999999s)]
*  He was effectively pushed out of the Labour Party for stating historical fact. I mean, that's what [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1699.04s)]
*  it comes down to, you know, and he was, it's not people accuse him of being weird. John Mann, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1704.96s)]
*  especially said, Oh, you've lost it, mate, you're, you're mental and you're, you know, [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1710.56s)]
*  you're, he was, he was using these kinds of mental health slurs in a way really, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1715.6799999999998s)]
*  and questioning his sanity and almost calling a ho, almost calling him a Holocaust denier, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1720.8s)]
*  essentially, because what he stated was historical fact, and he was asked about it. He was asked about, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1727.44s)]
*  he was asked about Hitler, and he was asked about social media posts about that Nash, [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1735.44s)]
*  Nassar had posted about what Hitler did being legal, quote unquote, legal. Well, that was, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1740.6399999999999s)]
*  you know, that was then presented as Nassar, this other Labour MP, that was then misreported in the [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1749.84s)]
*  media as Nassar, somehow being like a Nazi apologist or something. Well, no, it was a [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1755.68s)]
*  quote from Martin Luther King, where he was saying, never forget that what Hitler did was [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1760.24s)]
*  legal in the sense that yes, it was, it was, you know, they had the reins of power, they changed [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1765.36s)]
*  the laws, they, you know, they made anti Jewish laws. The Holocaust was was perpetrated, not by [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1769.76s)]
*  rogue elements, it was perpetrated by the state, you know, and so it Martin Luther King's point, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1776.56s)]
*  of course, was that what's being carried out, you know, I'm going to jail for standing up for [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1783.6s)]
*  equality for black people in America. But, you know, when there's an injustice, or you have to [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1789.76s)]
*  defy it. And you know, this is what Nassar had reposted on her Facebook. And it's been twist, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1794.8799999999999s)]
*  it was twisted in this kind of really insidious way. And we see the same thing happening time and [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1799.52s)]
*  time and time again, you know, Ken Loach as well, the filmmaker, the amazing filmmaker who's done [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1804.96s)]
*  so much. You know, I mean, I say Ken Loach spoke at my very kindly spoke at my book launch as we're [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1810.4s)]
*  filming this on on Friday after a few days after a few days before we're filming this. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1816.96s)]
*  And I said they're like, Ken Loach doesn't need to do this. He's, you know, he goes to Khan, the [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1824.4s)]
*  Khan Film Festival all the time. He's got a career as this mass, you know, filmmaker, you know, I'm [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1831.68s)]
*  sure he's quite wealthy. He doesn't need to do this kind of solidarity work that he does, but he [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1836.96s)]
*  always turns up to these things, because he feels it's the right thing to do. And in a similar way [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1843.2s)]
*  to Roger Waters, he uses his platform that he had to support people who need support, to support [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1848.8s)]
*  Palestinian rights to support working class struggles in this country. And, and the Israel [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1854.16s)]
*  lobby hates that they hate when they include Palestinians in struggles for equality in human [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1861.04s)]
*  rights and basic decency and basic dignity in the world. And they punish them by these [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1868.1599999999999s)]
*  false maliciously false allegations of anti-Semitism. Same things happen to Ken Loach, [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1875.9199999999998s)]
*  you know, he's, he said, there's currently a Labour, a local mayor, Jamie Driscoll, and he's [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1880.48s)]
*  kind of vaguely on the left. And, you know, and he and he's, to be honest, some of the things he [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1890.48s)]
*  said are not very good. Like he's, he supported the IHRA definition of anti-false Israel's [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1897.6s)]
*  favored definition of anti-Semitism and all this kind of stuff. And so he's gone along with some [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1903.6799999999998s)]
*  of what the Israel lobby wants, but nonetheless, he's still now being in the process of being purged [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1908.7199999999998s)]
*  from the Labour Party simply because he sat at an event with Ken Loach, who has supported Palestinians. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1912.8799999999999s)]
*  You know, it's crazy, you know, and it really is a witch hunt. And, you know, a lot of people [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1921.04s)]
*  warn these people from early on that it doesn't matter how many kind of, it doesn't matter how [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1926.24s)]
*  many people you throw under the bus, they're going to come for you eventually. And that's, [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1933.2s)]
*  that is what was happening. And this is another parallel with kind of the crucible and, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1936.96s)]
*  and the McCarthyist era is that, and this is something I mentioned in the book, like, [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1942.88s)]
*  this was one of the things that was done was that one of the, you know, one of the, one of the [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1951.28s)]
*  responses, and you see it in Arthur Miller's play that people who are accused sometimes, [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1957.12s)]
*  because, you know, they were in the case of what the historical events that are depicted in the [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1964.48s)]
*  crucible, they were facing death. And so the death penalty, you know, these young women [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1970.72s)]
*  for the, you know, alleged crime of being alleged witch and all this kind of stuff. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1976.8s)]
*  Sometimes people just got quite cowardly and they accused other people [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1982.72s)]
*  of the crime that they were being accused of. And this is what we saw in the Labour Party [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1987.28s)]
*  time and time again. I remember one post by a writer from Navarra Media, Ash Sarkar, who, [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=1992.48s)]
*  you know, is made famous by the being literally a communist, supposedly. I remember one really [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2000.72s)]
*  embarrassing tweet thread by her at one point where she was listing her, you know, her past [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2008.64s)]
*  thought crimes of antisemitism as a school child. And in order to kind of ingratiate herself to this, [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2014.08s)]
*  this kind of pro-Israel tendency, you know, it's just really embarrassing and disgusting. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2020.8s)]
*  Playing right into their hands. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2025.76s)]
*  It never protects them either, because they're then still accused of antisemitism anyway. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2027.36s)]
*  Well, and the one thing we know about the Israel lobby is they will never take yes for an answer, [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2032.1599999999999s)]
*  because none of this is actually about antisemitism. They're not trying to solve [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2037.6s)]
*  the problem they say they're trying to solve. They're trying to solve the problem of too many [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2044.2399999999998s)]
*  people supporting Palestinian rights and too many people seeing Israel for the brutal apartheid [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2050.4s)]
*  state that it is and demanding an end to whether it's British support for Israel or American [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2057.36s)]
*  support for Israel. That's the problem the Israel lobby wants to solve. So it doesn't matter how [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2062.96s)]
*  many times you confess to the sin of alleged antisemitism, as long as people are supporting [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2068.56s)]
*  Palestinian rights, they're going to keep it going. And you make this point in the book too, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2079.12s)]
*  Asa, about how there would be times when the crisis would seem to recede or just fade away, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2083.2799999999997s)]
*  and then it would come back in full force. And lo and behold, by coincidence, it would just be, [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2091.8399999999997s)]
*  you know, in the months before some important election. So it, which to me really illustrated [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2097.52s)]
*  just how manufactured it was and just how deliberate it was. One thing I'd love to hear you [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2104.64s)]
*  say a little bit about Asa is the role of the media, you just mentioned the left wing media, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2113.44s)]
*  which I'd love you to say more about too, but also just the mainstream UK media, what was their role [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2119.3599999999997s)]
*  in this? And what did we learn from that about the supposedly fiercely independent and, [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2127.92s)]
*  you know, feisty British press? Well, they don't exist. That's why [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2137.28s)]
*  the British media just really exposed itself as just the most vicious and vindictive propaganda [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2145.2000000000003s)]
*  system in existence, really, just the pure subservience to British authoritarianism, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2155.52s)]
*  to state power, to British capitalism. And just it was, it was quite stunning how uniform it was. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2163.28s)]
*  There was no support for Jeremy Corbyn whatsoever overall. I mean, there were certain times where [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2174.4s)]
*  you know, after there was a bit of an opening after the 2017 election advance, when there was [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2182.64s)]
*  a lot of people posting me a corpus saying, well, you know, I was wrong about saying that Jeremy [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2190.64s)]
*  Corbyn could never win an election and all this kind of stuff. But by and large, it was just vicious [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2195.04s)]
*  and vindictive. And I get into the detail of study in the book, I get into the detail of [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2202.08s)]
*  the studies that were done showing this, just how uniform it was. It was overwhelming and massive. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2209.12s)]
*  And the most hostile of all was The Guardian, this supposedly liberal newspaper, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2216.24s)]
*  which was the most opposed to Corbyn of all. The BBC was also very bad. I mean, you would expect [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2224.72s)]
*  you would expect the right wing media, of course, to be against him. But this, you know, [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2232.96s)]
*  the supposedly pro-Labour newspapers and the supposedly liberal newspapers. Well, yeah, [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2239.2s)]
*  okay, two newspapers. The BBC did that famous panorama episode, which was I think in 2019. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2246.4s)]
*  That's right. Yeah. And panorama is sort of this legendary BBC flagship news programme. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2255.04s)]
*  I think the equivalent would be something like 60 Minutes in the US. And they did this thing on [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2263.84s)]
*  Labour antisemitism, where they interviewed all these people, I think it was about eight, who [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2272.08s)]
*  claimed that they were victims of antisemitism and they're sort of giving their personal [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2279.36s)]
*  testimony of how awful things were in the Labour Party. And it was just [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2285.52s)]
*  unbelievable because the BBC, most of these people were actual staff members of [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2293.36s)]
*  Israel lobby groups that were fronts for the Israeli embassy, working hand in glove with [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2302.96s)]
*  the Israeli embassy. And they were not identified as such at all by the BBC. Their affiliation [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2309.6000000000004s)]
*  was not mentioned at all. One of them, of course, was Ella Rose, who she was literally the first [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2316.48s)]
*  person on screen. I mean, I sat down to watch it and I had to laugh. She was not before they said [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2322.48s)]
*  anything. There was Ella Rose right there. But she wasn't even identified. They didn't even give her [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2327.2000000000003s)]
*  name, let alone saying that she used to work for the Israeli embassy and was on the executive [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2331.76s)]
*  committee of the JLM, the Pro-Israel Zionist group. Which is also another front for the Israeli [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2336.4s)]
*  embassy. So she went from a position in the Israeli embassy to being director of the Jewish [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2342.48s)]
*  Labour Movement, which is a lobby group that works very closely with the Israeli embassy. So it was [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2350.5600000000004s)]
*  really a horizontal move, you could say. And the BBC didn't mention any of that. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2355.76s)]
*  I mean, it's been said so often, but you can imagine the response if this was Russia, you know, [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2362.6400000000003s)]
*  even before the war in Ukraine, before the all out, you know, before the invasion of Ukraine last [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2369.0400000000004s)]
*  year. Just imagine if it had been someone working for the Russian embassy who had made a sideways [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2375.2000000000003s)]
*  step to a pro-Russian group within the Labour Party. The response would have been absolute [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2382.16s)]
*  bedlam within the mainstream media. They would have raised hell about it. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2390.24s)]
*  But because it's Israel, it was like, oh, it's fine. Well, this is not even a story, basically. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2394.24s)]
*  And yeah, as you said, like the BBC, they weren't... So yeah, there was all these people who [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2401.44s)]
*  presented as these kind of brave members of the... Brave Jewish... [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2406.4s)]
*  Whistleblowers. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2411.36s)]
*  Yeah, brave Jewish youth from the Labour Party, sort of overcoming their fears of antisemitism and [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2412.0s)]
*  coming forward to blow the whistle on the Labour Party to the intrepid reporters of the BBC. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2419.6000000000004s)]
*  And it was never once stated that any of these people were on the executive committee. They were [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2426.1600000000003s)]
*  the leading activists. Most of them weren't... With the exception of Ella Rose, they weren't [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2433.84s)]
*  paid staffers as far as I know, but they were certainly the leading activists and the leaders [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2440.56s)]
*  of the Jewish Labour Movement, which is this pro-Israel organisation within the Labour Party, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2447.28s)]
*  which is essentially a proxy for the Israeli embassy, really. Which was really Corbyn's leading [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2453.04s)]
*  enemy, really, throughout his time in the leadership of the Labour Party. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2460.3999999999996s)]
*  And it was never disclosed. They didn't even give their names. It was ridiculous. And [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2464.56s)]
*  everyone sort of within the Corbynite movement, the grassroots, everyone recognised a lot of these [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2470.7999999999997s)]
*  people. But by and large, people watching at home in the wider electorate or just... And this was [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2476.72s)]
*  on mainstream TV. Like you said, I think 60 Minutes is a good comparison. This would be... [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2485.12s)]
*  Panorama is on just after dinner time. It's an early evening program that people will maybe watch [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2490.3199999999997s)]
*  over their dinner. And it's a mainstream thing in that way. And so it was very deceptive. The [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2496.64s)]
*  effect was very deceptive. And it came at a time... It was only a few months before the general [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2507.52s)]
*  election of 2019. But it was a time when there was a general election expected at any minute. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2513.44s)]
*  So it was... I mean, you could say it was in an indirect way, it was election interference [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2522.32s)]
*  with the involvement of a group certainly very close to the Israeli embassy that wasn't even [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2530.48s)]
*  disclosed. The JLM was... I forget if it was mentioned at all in the documentary, [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2536.48s)]
*  but certainly the role of these JLM activists was not disclosed within the documentary at all, [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2544.88s)]
*  not their position, not even their names. There was only one of them who gave her name, [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2550.4s)]
*  Izzy Lenga, who actually, it turned out, had trained. She's now a Labour Party councillor, [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2554.2400000000002s)]
*  and she's trained in the Israeli army. She actually paid to train in the Israeli army. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2561.28s)]
*  It was in this programme where she pays thousands of dollars to train with the Israeli army in this [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2565.76s)]
*  kind of paramilitary organisation. Very bizarre. And this is what the Labour Party is now. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2570.5600000000004s)]
*  And instead of calling out what had happened on Panorama, for example, instead of actively [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2576.8s)]
*  and emphatically denouncing this kind of weaponization of anti-Semitism in order to sabotage [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2587.92s)]
*  the Corbyn campaign, what did Corbyn and the people around him decide to do? What could they [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2593.36s)]
*  have done to save this campaign? And instead, what did they do? And how is that a lesson for [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2602.48s)]
*  how the left should respond to this kind of sabotage? Yeah, I think this is really the [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2612.88s)]
*  lesson that has to be learned. And unfortunately, what Corbyn and his team did far too more often [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2618.48s)]
*  than not was to essentially capitulate. They really embraced the Jewish Labour movement. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2625.44s)]
*  They made a show of really saying, oh, look, we don't have a problem with Jews. We're close to [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2630.32s)]
*  the JLM. But the left-wing non-Zionist Jews who were Corbyn's friends, who formed this group, [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2635.52s)]
*  Jewish Voice for Labour, to support Corbyn and to denounce the weaponized anti-Semitism, [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2643.2s)]
*  were persona non grata. I've heard from my sources that Corbyn, it's a fact that Corbyn never had any [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2649.2s)]
*  public meeting with them during his whole time. I still don't think he has. And I've heard from [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2657.8399999999997s)]
*  sources that there was sort of clandestine contacts going on between Corbyn's people and [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2665.68s)]
*  JVL, Jewish Voice for Labour. Well, why? It's completely insane. I mean, we know why, because [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2671.04s)]
*  the pro-Israel newspapers made them persona non grata. But why would Corbyn and his people [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2679.28s)]
*  have to play according to those rules? It was nonsense. By pandering to Israel and his lobby, [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2686.32s)]
*  as him and his team did, really, they only shot themselves in the foot. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2694.2400000000002s)]
*  You know, there was a small amount of independent media that was supportive of Jeremy Corbyn. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2698.56s)]
*  You know, there was us, there was websites like The Squawk Box and Canary, although Canary has [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2705.6800000000003s)]
*  gone in a very different direction these days. But at the time, they were very supportive of [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2715.6800000000003s)]
*  Jeremy Corbyn. And Corbyn didn't give interviews to them. He gave interviews instead to the Jewish [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2719.92s)]
*  Chronicle and the Jewish News, his supposed ally. Right. Yeah, his supposed ally, John [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2726.72s)]
*  McDonnell gave an interview to the Jewish News. And yes, nor as you say, these are two very [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2735.2799999999997s)]
*  right-wing newspapers who are incredibly anti-Palestinian, not just pro-Israel, [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2738.72s)]
*  but really quite racist towards Palestinians. And pretend to speak on behalf of all the Jews [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2743.6s)]
*  in the UK. Yeah, despite the fact of their tiny circulation. They're really kind of irrelevant. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2749.12s)]
*  This way, but they have this kind of mainstream clout in a way where mainstream journalists, [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2756.72s)]
*  corporate journalists will pick up on the Jewish Chronicle stories and they because they were [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2766.8799999999997s)]
*  handy to attack Corbyn with. So, look, I'm not saying you should never talk to any media ever [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2771.2799999999997s)]
*  that might be hostile, but why the hell would you, you know, make your friends persona non grata [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2776.9599999999996s)]
*  while trying to get, while giving exclusive interviews to enemy newspapers? They're not [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2783.92s)]
*  going to paint a favorable picture of in-group lives. They then had these front pages that said [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2791.28s)]
*  not good enough. And they, you know, it was just more bad headlines for him. It didn't work at all. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2796.96s)]
*  What they were trying to do. What sounds to me, I mean, no mystery here. I've said this too. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2801.76s)]
*  It was an appeasement strategy. It was the hope that if we throw enough people under the bus, [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2809.92s)]
*  eventually they'll be satisfied and they'll stop calling us antisemites and stop being mean to us [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2815.44s)]
*  and let us get on with things, which was just utterly delusional because that's not how the [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2821.6800000000003s)]
*  Israel lobby works. It's not how Israel works. Israel's strategy is always, you know, take [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2827.2000000000003s)]
*  whatever concession you get and then demand more. Never take, never take yes for an answer. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2833.92s)]
*  Exactly. How would someone like Jeremy Corbyn, who I personally have a great soft spot for. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2840.32s)]
*  Yeah, me too. He's a nice man. He's a decent man. I think he's one of the few very sincere [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2850.32s)]
*  people in politics, but as someone who had been a campaigner for Palestinian rights for decades, [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2856.4s)]
*  and presumably had therefore been exposed to the tactics of the Israel lobby, would he not know [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2863.92s)]
*  this? I mean, do you have any insight into what, why they took this route and what do you think [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2871.52s)]
*  would have been the alternative? What could have been an alternative that would have won? [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2881.04s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, those are really big questions. I think it's, it's difficult to say because Corbyn [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2887.4399999999996s)]
*  is still, I mean, look, I can say that I've spoken to people, you know, who were formerly [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2899.04s)]
*  very, quite high up within the former Labour leadership, who, one of them said in their words [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2910.32s)]
*  that they were still, well, they started to read my book and they said they were being triggered [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2919.6800000000003s)]
*  by it. And the person who said that was kind of half joking, but not joking. It is a traumatic, [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2927.2000000000003s)]
*  like what happened was a traumatic experience for a lot of people who, and it wasn't just people in [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2935.44s)]
*  within and around the leader, it was also, you know, there were some very serious things I [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2941.68s)]
*  didn't even get into in the book that happened to people, you know, there was one case of suicide [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2946.32s)]
*  where it was said that, and, you know, I haven't reported on it in detail because I wasn't able to [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2951.84s)]
*  verify it all, but it, you know, it was, it is understood by a lot of people within the, in the [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2958.72s)]
*  grassroots that the antisemitism smears against this particular person were a factor in their suicide. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2965.9199999999996s)]
*  I heard firsthand of a case of alcoholism that was caused by these kind of false allegations. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2972.08s)]
*  And so, you know, it's hard, you know, without a direct interview with Jeremy Corbyn and, you know, [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2979.8399999999997s)]
*  Jeremy Corbyn, if you're watching this, come on the electronic into father podcast. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2985.52s)]
*  Yes, seriously. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2989.44s)]
*  The door is open. Yeah. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2991.92s)]
*  Well, you know, we, we want to, you know, we really want to engage in a dialogue about this. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2993.12s)]
*  So it's hard to say without that. But what I would say, I mean, without, at the end of the day, [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=2999.04s)]
*  he was the leader. So that's, that's a fact. And, you know, without taking away from that, [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3005.68s)]
*  what I would say is that two individuals who were responsible for this appeasement strategy, [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3012.8s)]
*  probably more than any other, were John McDonnell, his, his shadow finance minister, [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3018.32s)]
*  and John Lansman, who is someone who previously regarded himself as a Zionist, [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3025.52s)]
*  and who became, he presented himself as this, and I get into it in the book, he presented himself [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3033.04s)]
*  as this kind of legendary, you know, fixer on the Labour Party left and all this kind of stuff, [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3039.28s)]
*  but he caused a massive amount of damage, a huge amount of damage. You know, every single, [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3044.2400000000002s)]
*  pretty much every single person who was falsely accused of antisemitism, he threw under the bus, [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3049.84s)]
*  starting with Jackie Walker, who was supposed to be his deputy in the momentum movement that he [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3056.2400000000002s)]
*  was involved in, which was a supposedly pro-Corbyn movement, which has now just gone completely [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3062.48s)]
*  ridiculous, and never, never really stood up for Corbyn when the chips were down, [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3068.0s)]
*  and started with Jackie Walker, you know, he denounced her. Chris Williamson, who really was [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3073.76s)]
*  the only MP to stand up to the smiths, you know, including Jeremy Corbyn, Chris Williamson, [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3079.68s)]
*  he ended up getting expelled from the Labour Party. He was technically not expelled in the end, [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3085.44s)]
*  he technically forced out, forced out, he was forced out, absolutely was forced out. And then [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3090.56s)]
*  he was suspended and then unsuspended and then resuspended after winning court case and so forth, [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3096.64s)]
*  because the Labour Party had illegally suspended him. He was absolutely forced out of the Labour [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3105.44s)]
*  Party, you know, and he was the only MP to openly say, these are smears, these are antisemitism. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3111.36s)]
*  You know, he said it in a very mild way at first, you know, he came in, he'd previously been an MP, [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3122.0s)]
*  he became more and more left-wing, he was always a lefty, but he became more and more enthused by [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3128.16s)]
*  the Corbyn movement, and he came in, and he was one of the MPs who came in in the 2017 elections, [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3132.64s)]
*  and you know, he is that strange thing in the so-called Party of Labour, [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3140.64s)]
*  an actual working class MP, who, you know, he was a bricklayer, and he was very open in saying, [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3148.2400000000002s)]
*  these are antisemitism smears. You know, he said it very mildly at first, he was very, you know, [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3156.4s)]
*  understanding and he said, look, I'm not saying it never exists, you know, there can be, you know, [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3161.2000000000003s)]
*  such a thing as antisemitism, the broad left, especially in a party of nearly 600,000 people, [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3166.56s)]
*  yeah, there could be some cases of it happening on the margins, of course that could happen, [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3173.6s)]
*  but what's being put out against Jeremy Corbyn and his supporters is a smear, like it's clearly, [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3179.44s)]
*  as if someone who's spent his whole career engaged in anti-racism, including being opposed to [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3187.2s)]
*  genuine cases of antisemitism, which is overwhelmingly from the right, from the fascist [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3193.52s)]
*  right, is clearly a smear campaign against him as punishment for his involvement in Palestine [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3198.24s)]
*  solidarity movements, and straight away his card was marked by the Israel lobby. He was visited by [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3205.04s)]
*  the JLM, by activists from the JLM, Jeremy Newmark, who was later involved in this corruption [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3210.7999999999997s)]
*  scandal. He's one of the top Israel lobbyists in the UK. 100%, and he's now set to be the leader [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3216.24s)]
*  of a council north of London, a labour leader of a council north of London, possibly, [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3224.88s)]
*  in the recent election there was no overall control in that particular council between labour [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3231.12s)]
*  and conservatives, but Jeremy Newark was this long-term Israel lobbyist, very close to the [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3238.2400000000002s)]
*  Israeli embassy, often on visits to Israel, and involved in the anti-boycott movement, which also [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3243.44s)]
*  had the involvement of the Israeli embassy, worked very closely with all these, he was a CEO [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3252.0s)]
*  of a particular Israel lobby group, going along with Adam Langelbren, who's still this, who's now [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3256.56s)]
*  the secretary of the Jewish labour movement, to lobby Chris Williamson essentially, and saying, [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3261.28s)]
*  look, we didn't agree with what you said about this being a smear in your interview with The Guardian, [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3265.92s)]
*  and you know, when you say something in the future about it, can you run it by us first? [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3272.32s)]
*  So they were trying to sound him out, but he, you know, he basically wasn't having that, and he was, [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3276.96s)]
*  became, you know, an increasingly strong anti-imperialist, and he talked about issues of, [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3283.44s)]
*  you know, against sanctions on Venezuela, things like that, and against the Integrity Initiative, [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3290.0s)]
*  which I didn't have time to get into in this book, which is really sort of spooky [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3295.7599999999998s)]
*  organization, very close to British, it's kind of a cut, it seems to be a kind of cut out for British [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3300.72s)]
*  spies essentially, which was, you know, involved in working against Jeremy Corbyn, and worked [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3306.3199999999997s)]
*  working for war around the world basically. He asked questions in parliament about it, [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3312.64s)]
*  which no one else would do, and he campaigned as well in the grassroots of the Labour Party [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3318.24s)]
*  for open selection, so that the Labour Party members could choose the candidates for MP, [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3323.92s)]
*  rather than them being all fixed by the bureaucracy who overwhelmingly put forward [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3330.08s)]
*  right-wing candidates by and large. And so, you know, because of all these things, but mostly [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3336.4s)]
*  because of the fact that he called the anti-Semitism smears, he was forced out of the Labour Party, [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3342.48s)]
*  and yeah, and Corbyn never stood up for him, which is a real shame, and it's ironic, because the [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3349.84s)]
*  position Chris Williamson was in is now exactly the position Jeremy Corbyn is in, because the way [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3359.04s)]
*  Chris Williamson was forced out of the party was that he was suspended as a Labour Party MP, [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3365.36s)]
*  which meant that he, because he was, you know, he was still an MP, because he'd been elected in a [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3373.84s)]
*  general election, but he no longer had the party's endorsement, so it meant that in the next election, [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3381.7599999999998s)]
*  which as I said in 2019, was expected at any time due to Brexit negotiations and all these [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3387.92s)]
*  kind of complications, and internal elections within the ruling Conservative Party, all this [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3392.7999999999997s)]
*  kind of stuff, so essentially a general election was expected at any time, it meant that Chris [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3398.56s)]
*  Williamson placed a really hard choice of he could stand as an independent in the next, in the [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3403.2s)]
*  upcoming general election, without the institutional backing of the UK's main opposition party, [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3408.72s)]
*  try and win as an insurgent independent, or just sort of back down, and so he just, he went for [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3415.6s)]
*  broke, and he quit the Labour Party and ran as an independent, and so Corbyn is now facing the exact [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3424.3199999999997s)]
*  same thing, he's still an MP, but he doesn't have in the next election, which could come as late as [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3429.8399999999997s)]
*  January 2025, but it could come any time between now and January 2025. Corbyn will not be the Labour [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3436.72s)]
*  Party's candidate in his local constituency, and as I mentioned in the book, and we haven't got to [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3447.3599999999997s)]
*  yet, is the fact that he's now been purged from within his own party, I think if he did choose to [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3457.2799999999997s)]
*  stand, he would have a good chance of winning, because he has a big profile, he's still got a [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3463.92s)]
*  lot of popular goodwill in the country, and he's got a lot of local goodwill as a constituent CMP, [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3467.84s)]
*  but the question is does he have the political will to fight as an independent, or as the leader [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3473.92s)]
*  of a new party? I don't know the answer to that. And if he can, you know, gather the will to [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3478.48s)]
*  stand up against these smears, you know, at the get-go and not- This is the thing, because if he [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3486.56s)]
*  does decide to do that, they're just going to remagnify these attacks. Exactly. I mean, it just- [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3491.92s)]
*  And his response, his response, according to the pattern that's gone so far, is going to be, [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3496.56s)]
*  I condemn antisemitism. Well, fine, you know, we all condemn antisemitism. You know, [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3502.4s)]
*  who could disagree with that? But the problem is if that's your response to a false [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3509.6800000000003s)]
*  allegation of antisemitism, you're then given the impression you do have something to apologize for, [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3514.7200000000003s)]
*  and that's not a winning strategy. No. No. And we're seeing that repeated. I mean, [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3520.16s)]
*  you just wrote in the last week, you appeared on an episode of the Katie Halper Show with Roger [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3526.96s)]
*  Waters, who, you know, you wrote about last week. The title of your story was, They're Trying to Do [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3534.72s)]
*  a Jeremy Corbyn on Roger Waters. This tactic is being repeated again and again and again, [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3540.64s)]
*  and you know, more viciously than ever, because it worked for them. And there wasn't a strong [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3546.64s)]
*  backlash against these tactics of weaponizing antisemitism. Can you talk about the political [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3556.0s)]
*  landscape right now, especially as these attacks continue? And, you know, Keir Starmer is the [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3565.2000000000003s)]
*  the leader of the Labour Party, who's just a stalwart for Israel. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3574.0s)]
*  Supporter of Zionism without qualification. That's right. That's his motto. Yeah, what does [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3579.84s)]
*  the landscape look like? And how are people fighting back if they are at all? Well, the [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3586.16s)]
*  landscape is really bleak, because this is such a useful political weapon. Like, yeah, [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3595.2s)]
*  people who have read my book have said, they have said like you, [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3603.6s)]
*  Ali and Nora, that, you know, they really enjoyed it. And it's, it's a true crime thriller. That's [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3608.0s)]
*  that is what I was going for. You know, I'm going for this kind of style of writing, I'm trying to [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3614.24s)]
*  make it engaging. And I it's good to hear that I was successful in that. But people have also said [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3618.24s)]
*  that they they found it hard to read at times, because it is the the truth isn't very pretty. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3623.68s)]
*  You know, this is what is happening. And this is this this weapon, and it is a good title. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3633.6s)]
*  The book title is a good one, which, you know, my, my publisher Colin came up with. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3640.48s)]
*  And it does encapsulate a lot of what is happening now, because it's such a useful weapon [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3647.84s)]
*  for the Israel lobby. And it's, it's such a useful weapon for the right in general, [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3656.08s)]
*  for everyone from the right wing of the Labour Party to the Conservative Party, [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3663.04s)]
*  to even the fascist right. The fascist right nowadays, which overwhelmingly supports Israel. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3667.92s)]
*  And historically, as you know, as you mentioned, Ali, as I get into in detail in chapter five of [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3675.44s)]
*  the book, Hitler's Nazis were supporting the Zionist movement in the night German Zionist [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3680.6400000000003s)]
*  movement in the 1930s as a way to remove German Jews from Germany to become forcibly to become [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3685.76s)]
*  settlers in Palestine. And so, you know, I've heard I've had I've heard stories of, [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3695.2s)]
*  of anti fascists who, you know, demonstrating against British fascists. And there's at the [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3705.44s)]
*  moment, there's a lot of media scare stories about refugees. And you get these small fascist groups [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3712.4s)]
*  like demonstrating against hotels that have that are putting up refugees who've crossed the, the, [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3718.72s)]
*  the, the, the so called English channel from from France. And when you get counter demonstration, [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3725.2s)]
*  anti fascist demonstrating against the fascists, the fascists will say, are you you lot are anti [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3734.72s)]
*  Semitic, Jeremy Corbyn's and anti semi your Jew haters. So everyone from the fascist right to [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3741.04s)]
*  the Labour Party right is using this false weaponized anti Semitism as a really useful [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3747.2s)]
*  political weapon against the left in general, you know, and this is a weapon that the Israel [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3753.2799999999997s)]
*  lobby has given the right given the right around the world. And it's such a useful weapon that it [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3759.4399999999996s)]
*  won't ever be abandoned. This idea that we can like sweep it under the carpet, and that we can [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3765.2799999999997s)]
*  just as john McDonald infamously said, Oh, we can cut the Gordian knots and we can endorse the IHRA [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3771.3599999999997s)]
*  definition and everything will be fine. And we'll move on from this. And I had people on Twitter, [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3777.04s)]
*  like telling me over and over again, oh, we just have to forget this and move on. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3781.44s)]
*  They won't let us forget it. It's going to be used over and over again. It can't be swept under. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3786.4s)]
*  It will never go away. It can only be defeated. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3791.7599999999998s)]
*  The feet that's that's the that's the crucial point. How do you defeat it? And I think what I [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3794.96s)]
*  mean, one of the lessons I take from this story, which by the way, is ongoing. I mean, it's Yeah, [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3801.2s)]
*  you know, you could say that that it's it's it's peaked in a sense, because the Israel lobby [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3807.9199999999996s)]
*  succeeded in getting rid of Jeremy Corbyn. And it is quite a tragic story for him personally. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3813.68s)]
*  Because now he is he went from being not just the leader of the Labour Party, but the leader of an [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3821.9199999999996s)]
*  historic mass movement that energised politics in the UK and in Europe and potentially with [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3828.0s)]
*  global implications in a way we hadn't seen in many, many decades to being now this marginal [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3837.36s)]
*  figure who has been exiled from his party, who, you know, may or may not retain his seat as an [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3844.48s)]
*  independent. But even if he does, is unlikely ever again to be in the position he was a few years ago. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3851.76s)]
*  But his allies are being purged one by one. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3860.96s)]
*  And his allies are being purged. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3863.0400000000004s)]
*  Dianne Abba is no longer. Yeah. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3864.8s)]
*  But but the to me, I do see and maybe I want to look for a silver lining. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3867.1200000000003s)]
*  So, you know, you can knock me down if you think I'm being too, too naive. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3880.08s)]
*  But I do see people fighting back now. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3885.68s)]
*  Maybe maybe not as much as you'd want in the UK. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3889.44s)]
*  But in the US, I think there was an effort to import the tactics that were used against Jeremy [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3892.56s)]
*  Corbyn wholesale. I think we saw this was this in the 2020. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3902.56s)]
*  It was during one of the election cycles in the US. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3907.2000000000003s)]
*  Of course, the US has election cycles every two years. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3910.4s)]
*  But there was an effort to do a Jeremy Corbyn on certain members of the Democratic Party, [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3914.0800000000004s)]
*  the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3922.8s)]
*  And it gained a little traction, but it did not. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3925.1200000000003s)]
*  It sort of flamed out. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3931.04s)]
*  And I think that there was a lot more pushback to it in the United States than even I expected. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3932.8s)]
*  And, you know, I think about this is one fact I learned in your book [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3942.6400000000003s)]
*  that may be significant, that maybe explains this difference to some extent is that in the UK, [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3949.2000000000003s)]
*  of course, there have always been British Jewish people at the forefront of the Labour movement, [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3957.04s)]
*  the trade union movement, the anti-fascist movement, the socialist movement. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3964.4799999999996s)]
*  But according to surveys, by and large, the vast majority of the British Jewish community [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3970.0s)]
*  vote conservative. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3976.56s)]
*  Whereas in the United States, the vast majority of the Jewish community vote Democrat. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3979.04s)]
*  Generally would identify as being much more liberal. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3985.52s)]
*  So the climate, I think, in the US was very different in that there was a much bigger [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3989.1200000000003s)]
*  pushback to the weaponization of anti-Semitism. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3996.4s)]
*  Of course, it's still going on, particularly on college campuses. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=3999.0400000000004s)]
*  And Nora is reporting on that all the time on the electronic inter-fada, the relentless. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4003.84s)]
*  And I just wrote about the Biden administration's new plan, which seems to endorse this approach of [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4010.7999999999997s)]
*  accusing students who campaign for Palestinian rights of anti-Semitism. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4017.2s)]
*  But that said, I don't think it got the same political purchase in the United States as it [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4021.9199999999996s)]
*  did in the UK. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4029.2799999999997s)]
*  And maybe that's something hopeful. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4030.72s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4032.3999999999996s)]
*  We also saw in last year's elections in France, there was another attempt to to [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4033.2s)]
*  Corbyn eyes. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4042.16s)]
*  Let's call it. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4042.96s)]
*  Is that a verb? [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4043.7599999999998s)]
*  Can I use the term? [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4044.56s)]
*  It is now. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4045.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4046.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4047.2s)]
*  To Corbyn eyes, Jean-Luc Melanchon, the head of the left wing movement in France. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4047.6s)]
*  And Melanchon is is kind of sort of a Corbyn like figure, but much more of a fighter. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4057.7599999999998s)]
*  And there was a strong attempt to paint the French left both in the presidential elections [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4063.8399999999997s)]
*  and in the parliamentary elections as being anti-Semitic because members specifically [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4072.7999999999997s)]
*  because members have supported Palestinian rights. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4080.48s)]
*  They made no bones about that. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4083.52s)]
*  And Melanchon came very close to, you know, in the first round of the presidential election, [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4085.68s)]
*  he was in the top three. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4095.12s)]
*  I mean, he was only, you know, the top three candidates. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4096.5599999999995s)]
*  And this includes McCall were all sort of in the 19, 20, 22 percent range or something [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4100.4s)]
*  like that. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4106.32s)]
*  Only the top two go through to the second round. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4107.5199999999995s)]
*  So that was an impressive performance. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4110.0s)]
*  And in the parliamentary elections, the French left did very well and they denied McCall [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4112.96s)]
*  and overall parliamentary majority. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4119.2s)]
*  So I haven't studied the French elections that closely, but I'm just saying at a very [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4121.76s)]
*  superficial level, these same tactics have not necessarily translated to other countries. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4129.6s)]
*  And I think we also see people pushing back against the IHRA definition in a way that [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4137.92s)]
*  is also, I think, very significant because the whole point of the IHRA definition and [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4146.96s)]
*  the way it has been marketed and pushed by Israel in the lobby is to say, oh, this is [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4154.88s)]
*  the international standard. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4160.96s)]
*  There's no debate about it. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4162.64s)]
*  Everybody accepts this definition. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4164.4s)]
*  Consensus. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4166.64s)]
*  Look, you know, these governments have accepted it. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4167.28s)]
*  These these prestigious institutions and universities have accepted it. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4170.16s)]
*  So the idea was just to sort of steamroll it across with no debate and by the force [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4174.8s)]
*  of just presenting it as this very respectable institutional thing that nobody disputes to [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4180.8s)]
*  impose it. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4188.96s)]
*  And of course, as we've reported many times, the IHRA definition is all about equating [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4190.32s)]
*  criticism of Israel and Zionism with anti-Jewish bigotry. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4196.64s)]
*  But that did not work in the sense that the IHRA definition has failed because it's [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4200.5599999999995s)]
*  controversial. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4209.12s)]
*  That's my view. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4210.0s)]
*  The only way it would have been really successful is by being non-controversial. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4213.04s)]
*  Like, I don't know, everyone agrees what a kilometer or a mile is. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4219.04s)]
*  It's a certain number of meters. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4225.5199999999995s)]
*  It's a certain number of yards. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4227.04s)]
*  We don't debate. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4229.36s)]
*  Don't debate what the real length of a mile is. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4230.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4234.5599999999995s)]
*  Now I'm going to find out in the comments. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4235.28s)]
*  Well, actually, yeah. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4238.48s)]
*  You see what I'm saying? [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4241.44s)]
*  So maybe. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4244.08s)]
*  So I do think there is important lessons in your book that go far beyond British politics. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4245.28s)]
*  That what's happening in Britain is an important story in itself. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4256.08s)]
*  But I think it has far broader relevance. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4259.84s)]
*  And for me, the key lesson is, as you put it, Asa, these things have to be confronted [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4262.4s)]
*  and defeated. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4269.599999999999s)]
*  And the way to confront them is with solidarity. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4271.2s)]
*  If Jeremy Corbyn had rallied the mass movement that had propelled him to the leadership of [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4275.92s)]
*  the Labour Party and said, look, we are an anti-racist party. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4285.44s)]
*  We oppose all forms of bigotry and racism, whether it's against black people or Jewish [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4290.639999999999s)]
*  people or Muslims or Asian people. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4296.639999999999s)]
*  Whatever it is, we stand with them against racism. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4300.799999999999s)]
*  But this is a smear campaign that is about attacking us for standing with the Palestinian [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4306.08s)]
*  people. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4314.32s)]
*  And we must confront it. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4315.04s)]
*  And we must not. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4316.719999999999s)]
*  And if he'd done that and rallied people, I think he would have won. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4317.679999999999s)]
*  I mean, maybe that's me being naive. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4322.639999999999s)]
*  But the lesson is you have to fight. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4324.719999999999s)]
*  You can't just. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4327.28s)]
*  You can't. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4329.599999999999s)]
*  This lobby is unappeasable. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4330.719999999999s)]
*  You have to fight. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4333.5199999999995s)]
*  You may lose. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4334.88s)]
*  You may fight and lose. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4336.16s)]
*  But if you don't fight, you're definitely going to lose. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4338.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4340.96s)]
*  I mean, I think we have to give Corbyn some credit. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4341.84s)]
*  You know, like you said, Ali, like I. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4345.280000000001s)]
*  I like the guy. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4349.04s)]
*  You know, I, you know, I've. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4350.400000000001s)]
*  I've spoken with him at events in the past, but I actually forgot about it. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4355.04s)]
*  But then, you know, these integrity initiative, spooky Twitter people brought it during the [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4359.76s)]
*  whole anti-Semitism campaign. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4364.4s)]
*  They posted on Twitter. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4366.08s)]
*  Oh, exclusive Jeremy Corbyn sat with Aesop and Stanley from Electronic [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4367.5199999999995s)]
*  Interfada, a Palestine Solidarity Conference a decade ago. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4372.0s)]
*  And I was like, oh, yeah, I did. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4376.5599999999995s)]
*  Didn't I? [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4377.759999999999s)]
*  And I forgot. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4378.4s)]
*  And the reason for that was because he was never a glory hunter. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4379.04s)]
*  He was always like he would chair the session and take notes. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4382.799999999999s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4386.16s)]
*  He was doing real work. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4386.879999999999s)]
*  And so. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4390.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4392.08s)]
*  You know, I still like the guy very much. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4392.48s)]
*  I think that he must have gone through some really hard times personally. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4394.639999999999s)]
*  I know the media were on his doorstep constantly harassing him [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4399.839999999999s)]
*  in a way they don't do to other political leaders. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4403.679999999999s)]
*  And, you know, it must have been very personally hurtful for him to be called an anti-Semite. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4408.08s)]
*  And I think he listened to really bad advice from some people who [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4414.0s)]
*  were really badly mistaken. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4418.08s)]
*  He did. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4419.76s)]
*  There was times when he did stand up to the anti-Semitism smears. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4421.280000000001s)]
*  You know, there was I mentioned a couple of them in my book. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4424.400000000001s)]
*  You know, there was in 2018 where Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted about what an anti-Semite he was. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4426.88s)]
*  And Corbyn did come back with a tweet that said Benjamin Netanyahu saying about me is [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4434.320000000001s)]
*  completely untrue. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4439.52s)]
*  But what should be condemned is the Israeli government gunning down all these Palestinian [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4440.400000000001s)]
*  and on demonstrators on the boundary line with Gaza. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4445.84s)]
*  That was quite good. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4449.04s)]
*  And then, you know, he did try and put up a fight against the HRA [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4451.200000000001s)]
*  document internally within the Labour Party. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4456.8s)]
*  Fortunately, he had no one inside the Labour Party to support him to do that. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4459.4400000000005s)]
*  And even his own people seemed to go along with it, especially his so-called ally, [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4463.12s)]
*  John McDonnell, who really kind of threw him under the bus over that issue. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4466.8s)]
*  So there was those kind of instances. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4473.280000000001s)]
*  But we would have, unfortunately, those were the minority of cases and there should have [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4475.84s)]
*  been a lot more of that. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4480.48s)]
*  That should have been the norm rather than exceptions on the issue. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4481.76s)]
*  Corbyn's political instincts are quite often more often than not right. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4487.76s)]
*  And you can not say that about politicians in general. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4492.8s)]
*  It's usually the other way around. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4496.8s)]
*  Politicians instincts are generally wrong. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4498.48s)]
*  And Corbyn's instincts are quite often right. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4500.96s)]
*  And when he stuck to his guns, he went on things. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4503.84s)]
*  So on other issues, he did fight a lot more like, and I've said this on other podcasts, [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4508.24s)]
*  in the 2017 election campaign, during the course of the election campaign, [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4513.68s)]
*  there was the horrific Manchester bombing, which, you know, this bombing of a con Ariana Grande [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4519.84s)]
*  pop concert. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4526.16s)]
*  And, you know, a lot of people supposedly on the left were like, oh, Jeremy Corbyn, [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4528.08s)]
*  he's going to have to back down with the anti war stuff now. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4532.24s)]
*  He's going to have to just condemn the terrorists and just leave it at that. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4535.12s)]
*  Well, he didn't to his credit. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4539.04s)]
*  He didn't do that. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4540.4s)]
*  You know, he came, he stuck to the traditional anti war argument, which is, yes, of course, [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4541.44s)]
*  the bombers are the ones responsible for the atrocity. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4548.16s)]
*  He didn't get into the culpability of the British security services, which is, you know, [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4551.44s)]
*  maybe another topic for another time. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4556.16s)]
*  But nonetheless, in terms of, you know, the bomber and his involvement in the war in Libya, [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4557.92s)]
*  but he stuck to the sort of simple anti anti war line, which is, yes, the bombers are [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4564.96s)]
*  responsible for the atrocity, but also British foreign policy of invading other countries [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4570.4800000000005s)]
*  and illegal wars has a major contributing factor in these things taking place. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4577.04s)]
*  And he did that quite openly, quite loudly, and it was massively popular. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4583.4400000000005s)]
*  You know, it was very, very popular within the general electorate, and it only increased his [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4588.400000000001s)]
*  polling. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4594.96s)]
*  And so, like you said, Ali, that if he'd stuck by his guns, rallied the troops and said, [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4595.84s)]
*  this is an act, this is a smear campaign. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4601.76s)]
*  It's not real anti-Semitism. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4603.52s)]
*  It's a smear campaign. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4604.72s)]
*  If he'd done that, he might not have won. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4605.92s)]
*  It might not have worked, but at least he would have made a stand and it would [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4608.8s)]
*  have set up a basis for the future. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4612.4s)]
*  You know, and that is the only possible way to win is to fight. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4614.879999999999s)]
*  Asa, your book is remarkable. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4621.2s)]
*  We wanted to close out by just talking about the role that, I mean, your reporting over [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4625.599999999999s)]
*  the last eight years on this issue could not have been possible without the electronic [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4632.5599999999995s)]
*  devata and independent media who was willing to take on the story and give a platform to those [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4638.88s)]
*  who were calling out the weaponization of anti-Jewish bigotry in order to sabotage the [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4648.88s)]
*  Corbyn campaign and smear the left as a whole. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4656.72s)]
*  You talked about the role of the establishment media taking their cue from right-wing, [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4661.04s)]
*  you know, rag, like the Jewish Chronicle, for example. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4668.400000000001s)]
*  What about the role of independent media and, you know, your work on EI in particular [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4675.280000000001s)]
*  was able to make this story even possible to publish? [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4682.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4686.4800000000005s)]
*  So the hardest part of this book was getting it published. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4687.2s)]
*  And still now, all books is not a British publisher. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4690.64s)]
*  They have a kind of transatlantic footprint in a way, but they're a New York publisher [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4695.52s)]
*  and all credit to them for publishing it. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4703.280000000001s)]
*  But, you know, the fact that not even the British left-wing press would publish this book, [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4708.4800000000005s)]
*  and I did approach them all, it just goes to show really that [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4713.4400000000005s)]
*  how successful this anti-Semitism smear campaign was, I think. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4719.92s)]
*  And that's number one. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4723.84s)]
*  But so getting it published was difficult, but writing it wasn't that hard. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4725.6s)]
*  You know, it didn't take me long to actually write the first draft at all. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4732.96s)]
*  And the reason for that is because I'd already done the reporting, the essential reporting [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4736.56s)]
*  for the electronic edifier, and that was only possible because we are completely independent [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4742.24s)]
*  and we are supported by our readers. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4748.32s)]
*  You know, we don't have any state or corporate donors. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4751.76s)]
*  We're completely independent and we're completely free to report these issues with our [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4756.4s)]
*  censorship except for the general internet tech censorship. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4762.56s)]
*  But in terms of our editorial and financial agenda, we have no, [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4767.84s)]
*  you know, censorship that the mainstream media has in that way. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4772.64s)]
*  And so, you know, and that is exactly why we are, you know, censored by the tech giants, [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4776.72s)]
*  as all the other independent media is. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4782.88s)]
*  And so, yes, this book is a real example of independent media, the funding of independent [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4787.44s)]
*  media being important because I was only able to follow this story for seven, eight years now [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4793.36s)]
*  and report on it in such detail because I was able to do so professionally for the [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4800.88s)]
*  electronic edifier. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4805.36s)]
*  And without the support of our readers and donors, that would have been impossible. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4807.12s)]
*  So this book, in a very real sense, only exists because people are willing to, [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4812.4s)]
*  you know, put their hands in their pockets and support independent journalism. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4818.96s)]
*  And that's, you know, that's really important. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4822.96s)]
*  Well, it is, it has been really amazing, Asa, to see the impact that your reporting has had. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4825.200000000001s)]
*  I can say that your stories following this fake anti-Semitism crisis have consistently been some [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4834.88s)]
*  of our most read stories over the years. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4846.8s)]
*  And I think that's not just because they were brilliantly written and investigated [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4849.84s)]
*  and fairly well edited. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4857.12s)]
*  I edited quite a few, so I'm going to give myself a pat on the back. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4859.679999999999s)]
*  You should, absolutely. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4863.28s)]
*  But it was always a pleasure. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4864.88s)]
*  It was always a feeling of excitement that we were doing something that had to be done [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4867.12s)]
*  and that really nobody else was doing. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4875.5199999999995s)]
*  You mentioned some other publications and credit to them, but I really don't think anyone else, [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4878.64s)]
*  whether as a journalist, meaning you, or as a publication, followed this story in the depth [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4885.280000000001s)]
*  and consistency that you did. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4892.160000000001s)]
*  And that's why I think that's a large part of why these stories were always so widely [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4897.76s)]
*  circulated and would go viral because there was a need that nobody else was willing to fill, [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4904.72s)]
*  not the Guardian, not the BBC, not the Times, not the London Review of Books. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4910.56s)]
*  Nobody was willing to do it. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4917.52s)]
*  And I think it's- [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4919.2s)]
*  People wanted to sweep it under the carpet and I just sort of couldn't let that happen, really. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4921.360000000001s)]
*  And I just felt like a duty to do it. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4925.52s)]
*  And I keep saying, like, okay, especially with the book published now, I'm done. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4928.240000000001s)]
*  That's it. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4933.04s)]
*  I've literally written the book on it, but the story isn't over. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4933.84s)]
*  I could probably do a volume two, really. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4937.12s)]
*  So if the book- [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4941.280000000001s)]
*  But buy the book. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4942.0s)]
*  If it's successful enough, I'll do a volume two because I unfortunately- [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4943.280000000001s)]
*  It sounds like a thread. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4947.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4948.56s)]
*  I really hope people will buy the book, Asa, and I hope they will not just buy it for themselves, [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4950.96s)]
*  but it's a fantastic gift to give. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4956.96s)]
*  People have been telling me they've ordered it for their local libraries, which is nice to hear. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4959.44s)]
*  And that's the other thing I want to say is people can urge their local libraries, [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4962.96s)]
*  not just in the UK, but in the US, you can request your local library to get it, [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4967.36s)]
*  or if you're in university, you can request your university or college library to get it. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4973.44s)]
*  And this story needs to be told and you've told it so well, Asa, and we're so proud. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4978.799999999999s)]
*  And it's exciting to see it picking up so well. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4983.759999999999s)]
*  And it's exciting to see it picking up steam. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4987.04s)]
*  And it's been, it is, it has been and continues to be a great pleasure [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4990.08s)]
*  to work with you on this story and others. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=4998.0s)]
*  And you used a word to say that it can be, you look at the political landscape and it can be bleak. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=5000.96s)]
*  But I find a lot of hope in seeing the reaction to your book and seeing people starting to [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=5010.08s)]
*  talk about these things again, as they should be talked about. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=5020.719999999999s)]
*  And honestly, we have a good time doing this work because it's important work. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=5024.24s)]
*  And I think these stories need to be told. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=5031.2s)]
*  So congratulations, Asa. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=5034.96s)]
*  It's really, I'm very proud to work with you and to see this book finally take physical form. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=5037.68s)]
*  I don't have my copy yet. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=5047.36s)]
*  It's on its way, but I've just finished reading the ebook [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=5049.4400000000005s)]
*  and I can't wait to get my hands on the copy as well. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=5053.04s)]
*  Great. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=5055.76s)]
*  Well, thank you very much. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=5056.400000000001s)]
*  And as I say in the acknowledgments, Ali, I don't think I could have done this book without, [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=5058.16s)]
*  well, I know I couldn't have done this, but without all my colleagues and specifically [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=5064.08s)]
*  without you, because there were several key points where I was kind of getting really [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=5068.16s)]
*  fatigued and thinking, I'm sick of this. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=5075.04s)]
*  I don't want to write about this and maybe questioning it. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=5077.76s)]
*  And you sort of said, no, look, this is all about Israel. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=5080.88s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, it is. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=5085.84s)]
*  So that was really important, I think. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=5087.76s)]
*  It's the motivator. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=5090.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=5091.28s)]
*  No, seriously, because you have the outside perspective, because this is why, [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=5092.24s)]
*  obviously, I live in London, I live in the UK and I'm affected by this terrible political [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=5100.8s)]
*  environment in this country. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=5105.68s)]
*  But the outside perspective of a US-based organization like EI was so important because [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=5107.52s)]
*  you were able to say, look, this is obviously rubbish and stick with it, keep going with it. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=5113.04s)]
*  And that was so important. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=5118.88s)]
*  So thank you. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=5121.92s)]
*  Well done, Asa. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=5123.92s)]
*  So proud. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=5125.36s)]
*  And of course, we'll have... [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=5126.56s)]
*  We all get a pat on the back. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=5127.52s)]
*  That's right. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=5129.84s)]
*  And we'll, of course, have all the info on how you can pick up a copy of this [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=5135.76s)]
*  fantastic book by our colleague on the podcast post that accompanies this episode. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=5140.0s)]
*  Ali, Asa, thank you. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZWN6X9CAs&t=5145.68s)]
