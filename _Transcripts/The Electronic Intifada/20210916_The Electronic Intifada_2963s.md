Video Description: On episode 44, Nora and Asa speak with the lead organizers of a new initiative calling on musicians to refuse to book shows in Israel and stand in solidarity with Palestinians. 
We also feature a conversation with author and educator Mona Hajjar Halaby about her new memoir.
Stefan Christoff and Jessie Lauren Stein of Musicians for Palestine explain why major artists signed their pledge to “speak together and demand justice, dignity and the right to self-determination for the Palestinian people and all who are fighting colonial dispossession and violence across the planet.”
Rage Against the Machine, Patti Smith, Noname, Vic Mensa, Thurston Moore and Run the Jewels are amongst the initial signatories.

Artists commit to being loud about their solidarity with Palestinians, which Stein says is “a little play on the act of being a musician – we’re noisemakers.”
“So that commitment to speaking out is a really important part of the letter, because it demands that each of us make noise in our own networks,” she adds.
The initiative, Christoff explains, “is about saying yes, okay, we don’t want to see artists being booked in concerts that are about creating cultural capital that covers Israeli war crimes.”
“But I think it’s also important to think about our power. And that’s really what this letter is about,” he added.
An updated list of signatories will be published this fall.
The Musicians for Palestine initiative has also launched a podcast featuring discussions with international artists who have taken a stand for justice in Palestine.
Tracing history in Jerusalem
Palestinian American author and educator Mona Hajjar Halaby joins us to talk about her new book In My Mother’s Foosteps: A Palestinian Refugee Returns Home.
Halaby was born in exile in Alexandria, Egypt, to a Syrian father and Palestinian mother from Jerusalem.
Growing up, she tells The Electronic Intifada Podcast, her mother, Zakia, told countless stories about her childhood in West Jerusalem and the violent loss of her home when Zionist militias forced Palestinians out in the late 1940s.
“Her home was taken away and she could never return to it after she had gone for what she thought was a couple of weeks until the bombing subsided … So in many ways, her story was a story of loss,” Halaby says.
Halaby returned to Palestine to teach at a school in Ramallah, and was eventually joined by her elderly mother. Together they retraced Zakia’s footsteps.
“She amazed me,” Halaby tells us.
“I thought [she] might become angry because you think about someone who returns to someplace that was taken away from her,” she says.
“But instead, she came with such an open heart that for her, it was like meeting again an old friend she hadn’t seen for years. She was touching the stones, rubbing her hands on the stones on the outside of the house.”
Halaby maintains a Facebook page focused on photographs of Jerusalem during the first half of the 20th century called British Mandate Jerusalemites Photo Library. She also collaborated on the interactive documentary Jerusalem We Are Here.

# Musicians make noise for Palestinian rights | EI Podcast
**The Electronic Intifada:** [September 16, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA)
*  The reality of living in Jerusalem also meant facing life under Israeli occupation, crossing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=0.0s)]
*  checkpoints, navigating the separation wall, witnessing my people brutalized and dehumanized. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=16.4s)]

*  This is the Electronic Intifada Podcast. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=28.8s)]
*  I'm Nora Beros Friedman. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=31.84s)]
*  And I'm Asa Winstanley. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=34.0s)]
*  Welcome back to the Electronic Intifada Podcast. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=40.16s)]
*  During the Israeli assault on Gaza this past May, hundreds of musicians from around the world [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=42.72s)]
*  pledged to refuse to book shows in Israel. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=49.2s)]
*  Major artists including Rage Against the Machine, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=52.32s)]
*  Patty Smith, No Name, Vic Mensah, Thurston Moore, and Run the Jewels [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=54.96s)]
*  signed the pledge to, quote, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=59.76s)]
*  speak together and demand justice, dignity, and the right to self-determination for the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=61.2s)]
*  Palestinian people and all who are fighting colonial dispossession and violence across the planet. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=65.76s)]
*  Today we'll be speaking with two musicians, activists, and leading organizers of the Musicians [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=72.32s)]
*  for Palestine Initiative, Stefan Kristof and Jesse Stein, to talk about the second wave of signatories [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=77.68s)]
*  and a new list of names that will be out very soon. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=84.16s)]
*  Stefan and Jesse, thank you so much for being with us on the Electronic Intifada Podcast. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=86.88s)]
*  Thank you for having us. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=92.0s)]
*  So, Stefan, let's start with you. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=94.24s)]
*  Talk about the initiative, what Musicians for Palestine is, and why it's significant [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=97.36s)]
*  that there are so many new names being added to this list. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=102.72s)]
*  Usually we see this very often. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=106.32s)]
*  When Israel attacks Gaza, there's a wave of activism, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=109.12s)]
*  and then the voices kind of die down as soon as there's a ceasefire. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=112.32s)]
*  But this is different. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=117.11999999999999s)]
*  Talk about this campaign. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=118.55999999999999s)]
*  Well, beyond simply responding to, say, for example, an artist that chose to break [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=122.0s)]
*  the boycott picket line and play a concert in Israel, that type of initiative is very important. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=130.64s)]
*  And appealing to artists to support the Palestinian call for boycott, divestment, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=137.52s)]
*  and sanctions against the Israeli state, that is super important. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=145.04000000000002s)]
*  This initiative is building on a lot of those efforts, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=148.4s)]
*  but is also very rooted in community and trying to sustain and to facilitate and to nurture [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  a global network of artists, musicians specifically around the world that can speak together [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  in support of Palestinian human rights within the context of very horrendous war crimes, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  which we saw in May against the Palestinian people in Gaza particularly. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=177.04s)]
*  Also beyond that, to think about the more systemic, long-term violence of Israeli [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=186.0s)]
*  state policies of apartheid and occupation. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=193.36s)]
*  So this is trying to, yes, respond to particular situations, but also to think in a constructive [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=195.92000000000002s)]
*  way as to what we can do together as musicians to speak to this reality in the long term, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=202.96s)]
*  and also outside of the news cycle headline. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=210.24s)]
*  Can you talk about the letter itself? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=214.56s)]
*  We'll show it here on the screen for our viewers. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=216.72s)]
*  Talk about what the pledge says and the process of getting these hundreds of artists, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=218.88s)]
*  some backed by large record companies and many independent artists to sign on. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=223.76s)]
*  Jessie, can you talk about that? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=228.0s)]
*  Certainly. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=230.64s)]
*  So the letter has this reiterated phrase where we say that we commit to not being silent, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=232.79999999999998s)]
*  which is a little play on the act of being a musician or noisemakers. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=243.12s)]
*  But in signing the Musicians for Palestine letter, musicians have committed to speaking out [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=249.04000000000002s)]
*  about what we know to have long been the case, which is the major oppression of Palestinian [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=256.32s)]
*  people, the occupation of their lands, and all of the nefarious forms that this takes, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=263.04s)]
*  as well as committing to the material action of not playing, as you mentioned earlier, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=269.52s)]
*  in institutions that are backed by the Israeli state or that are in Israel. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=274.8s)]
*  So that commitment to speaking out is a really important part of the letter, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=282.64s)]
*  because it demands that each of us make noise in our own networks. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=289.04s)]
*  And one of the really interesting and exciting things about this letter [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=294.8s)]
*  is that it attracted signatories from all over the world. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=298.24s)]
*  It really had quite a diverse body of musicians, not only in terms of genre, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=301.76000000000005s)]
*  but especially in terms of their geographic locale. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=306.96000000000004s)]
*  So people coming from all sorts of different places sign this letter, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=310.32000000000005s)]
*  and each of them are tapped into different communities of people. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=314.56s)]
*  And I think that that kind of gets to something that Stephane said earlier, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=317.76000000000005s)]
*  which is doing what we can as musicians. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=320.56s)]
*  It's not always a direct line from the art we make and the artistic communities in which we live, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=323.44s)]
*  and our politics, especially when we're speaking to an issue that [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=332.96s)]
*  may be far away from us personally. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=337.2s)]
*  So what's interesting is that as a kind of diffuse network of musicians, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=340.24s)]
*  if we use each of our spaces, both media spaces and our actual physical spaces in which we gather [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=345.76s)]
*  and play music, to have conversations about what's going on in Palestine and to take a stand on [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=351.68s)]
*  these issues, that is one of the things that we can do. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=357.92s)]
*  We can make a conversation that should long have been very much at the forefront of what people [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=361.12s)]
*  are thinking about and has been, certainly for many people. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=369.04s)]
*  But for those around the world who maybe have not been thinking about Palestine so much, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=371.92s)]
*  this is an opportunity to be introduced to what's going on there and to our perspective on it. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=379.2s)]
*  Jess, did you think since May, since Israel's last major attack on Gaza in May, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=389.03999999999996s)]
*  do you think there's been a shift in artists' attitudes more towards supporting BDS? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=394.32s)]
*  Do you think you've seen that more recently? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=400.15999999999997s)]
*  And if so, what do you attribute to that? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=403.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, certainly I do think that there has been an increase in support for BDS. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=406.24s)]
*  Just to be very clear, although personally I support BDS and many of the signatories do, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=413.76000000000005s)]
*  the letter doesn't explicitly engage with BDS as a framework, although we do share many [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=421.20000000000005s)]
*  very similar values. And like I said, I personally support BDS. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=428.96000000000004s)]
*  I have noticed that in the communities in which I have direct access, that there is an increase [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=434.72s)]
*  in visibility in BDS and people seem more comfortable with the idea. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=441.52000000000004s)]
*  I think that that definitely has to do with Black Lives Matter taking a stand and people [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=446.64000000000004s)]
*  becoming more politicized with the uprisings in the wake of the murder of George Floyd. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=452.64000000000004s)]
*  I think that it also has to do with obviously the very long-standing work that people in BDS have [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=458.64s)]
*  done to raise awareness of what's going on and the people on the ground in Palestine who have been [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=465.84s)]
*  showing up in Jerusalem, showing up every day to these protests and becoming a little bit more [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=471.84s)]
*  a forefront story in international media. I think also very important have been certain [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=478.88s)]
*  Jewish solidarity groups that have contested the notion that supporting Palestinian human [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=485.28s)]
*  rights is anti-Semitic, which is a very crucial work. Yeah, so that's how I would place it. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=492.08s)]
*  It's been nice to see people engaging with it a little bit more comfortably. I think it's very [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=499.76s)]
*  important. And Stefan, did you want to add to that? Well, yeah, I mean, I think it's important to [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=505.52s)]
*  always underline that whatever initiative takes place, Musicians for Palestine in this context [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=513.36s)]
*  builds on a history of organizing. And I think locating actions that are happening now within a [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=522.24s)]
*  trajectory allows us to see that, I mean, whether we're talking about the boycott, divestment, and [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=529.2s)]
*  sanctions movement that only launched in 2005 with the call of Palestinian Civil Society. But [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=536.72s)]
*  I mean, that's obviously rooted going back to the 1960s and 70s and the organizing of the [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=543.36s)]
*  Lebanese Communist Party, for example, or left organizations within the global south who pushed [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=554.64s)]
*  for many years to try to raise awareness globally around the importance of [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=561.28s)]
*  a collective economic action against the American National Congress, the ANC, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=571.04s)]
*  solidarity in the 1980s in Central America. So there's this context in history. And I think [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=576.64s)]
*  that that is really important in locating also our choice to really try through this letter to [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=583.36s)]
*  make sure that the geographical location of the artists is global. So I'll just highlight the [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=590.16s)]
*  fact that quite a few of the artists who signed were from Chile, for example, and like Las Dices [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=594.64s)]
*  Collective, for example, helped us in gathering is really important to underline. That's the [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=600.9599999999999s)]
*  collective, of course, that in Chile was central to raising the feminist critique of [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=609.04s)]
*  patriarchy and state violence in Chile, but was that the global nature of the signatories [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=620.0s)]
*  reflects also the global nature of solidarity efforts that have happened over generations. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=627.1999999999999s)]
*  And so it's really exciting in that sense that I do see also our capacity to speak with artists [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=632.8s)]
*  around the world and their interest in Palestine directly. And both of you talk a little bit about [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=639.4399999999999s)]
*  the so-called silent boycott, where artists just don't book gigs in Israel to begin with. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=646.4s)]
*  What the impact of that you think has been on Israeli cultural institutions, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=652.24s)]
*  as well as the impact of the very visible boycott campaigns where artists dump their gigs in [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=657.68s)]
*  Tel Aviv, for example, after global pressure, or sign a pledge like the Musicians for Palestine [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=663.04s)]
*  Letter and say, initially, we will never perform in Israel? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=669.76s)]
*  Yeah. So I think, like, I just want to be really clear, like, in terms of, like, also, like, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=675.68s)]
*  in Montreal locally, where I live, I worked on this concert series called Artists Against [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=683.76s)]
*  Apartheid, and we had 23 concerts over about five years, six years. And it was really about, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=690.96s)]
*  like, a creative response to the situation to be taking action, but also to create a space for [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=698.4000000000001s)]
*  musicians to express themselves, to create work for musicians from different bands to collaborate. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=706.32s)]
*  And so I think that it's about building power on our terms. So Musicians for Palestine is more [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=712.5600000000001s)]
*  global initiative, but it's about saying, yes, okay, we don't want to see artists being booked [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=720.24s)]
*  in concerts that are about creating cultural capital that covers Israeli war crimes. And that's [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=727.6800000000001s)]
*  really what the role is of, you know, in the context of Israel, listeners of this podcast know [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=735.12s)]
*  that. But I think it's also important to think about our power. And that's really what this [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=740.5600000000001s)]
*  letter is about, right? Like, it's about responding to the BDS call, we made sure to communicate [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=745.76s)]
*  clearly, and to review the letter and the process with the Palestinian Campaign for an Academic and [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=751.2s)]
*  Cultural Boycott of Israel, PACB, and the BNC Boycott National Council, but it's also autonomous. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=757.04s)]
*  And in the sense that it's happening as part of that global network, but it's also [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=764.56s)]
*  an initiative that I hope can say that, well, we're doing things on our terms. And we're saying, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=772.64s)]
*  you know, for example, we're going to release a podcast soon, which is about conversations [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=779.36s)]
*  with different artists that sign the letter. And a lot of musicians have written us like [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=783.52s)]
*  many hundreds since this letter came out, saying they want to join and many people are sharing [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=790.56s)]
*  ideas, right? So I think that what's interesting is that, yes, it's grounded in taking that action, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=795.68s)]
*  but it's also saying, we can grow something, building on all the amazing initiatives [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=802.4799999999999s)]
*  around the world. This one, we were lucky to get a lot of support from high profile musicians. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=808.64s)]
*  And that also didn't happen in a vacuum. Some of those high profile musicians that supported, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=814.88s)]
*  there were conversations for a number of years with people to encourage them to consider [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=820.16s)]
*  speaking out about Palestinian human rights, but it took time, right? So it's also these things [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=828.0s)]
*  don't happen overnight, but it's about our power and to say together as musicians, we refuse silence. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=832.48s)]
*  If you could let our listeners and viewers know where they can find the letter and what kind of [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=842.8s)]
*  process it is to sign the pledge if they're a musician and want to add their name to the list. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=849.12s)]
*  And also talk a little bit about your own music, both of you, and where we can find your music online. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=855.44s)]
*  Well, people who are interested in reading the letter and who discover that they would like to [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=864.48s)]
*  sign it upon reading the letter can do so at the website www.musiciansforpalestine.com, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=870.16s)]
*  snappy little name. And the process for signing the letter is, it begins with sending us a message [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=877.92s)]
*  through the website and then we take it from there because we have to verify people's identity [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=889.76s)]
*  in order to add them to the official next round of the letter, which will happen in the coming months. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=895.76s)]
*  Yeah, and as for music, I've long played in a project called the Luyas, which is [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=902.88s)]
*  a weirdo little rock band based in Montreal, and it's very fun. And if you Google us, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=912.24s)]
*  you will discover many flattering and unflattering photographs and videos. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=920.48s)]
*  Great, thanks, Jesse. And Stefan? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=925.28s)]
*  Yeah, what Jesse said, we're trying to prepare for a launch in the fall of the second wave of [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=931.92s)]
*  signatories. It's about community building too, right? So I think that in the end, we'll probably [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=938.9599999999999s)]
*  have about 1000 additional musicians signing, it seems. But as was mentioned, we want to verify and [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=945.92s)]
*  also create communication. So it's not like just you sign online and then that's it, right? So we're [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=953.76s)]
*  actually trying to correspond with each person as a way of building that network so we can say in [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=960.0s)]
*  the future, oh, well, there's a Palestinian hunger strike going on within the prisons, right? So we [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=965.92s)]
*  can then share the information with all the musicians. And it's not this sort of hole of [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=972.8s)]
*  the internet where there's no actual human connection with the people who sign this letter. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=979.2s)]
*  I can say that all of the initial signatories on musiciansforpalestine.com, there's a personal [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=984.88s)]
*  connection and there's some sort of human connection that's why the signatory is there, right? So [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=991.6800000000001s)]
*  we're going through a similar process for the second letter. I play music too. I play [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=998.6400000000001s)]
*  instrumental music. It's quite experimental. And I just played a show in Sofia, Bulgaria [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1005.68s)]
*  last week at the National Radio. And yeah, that was super special experience. So I play piano [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1013.28s)]
*  and I play a lot with different musicians. It's under my name, Stéphane Christophe. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1022.2399999999999s)]
*  Stéphane has a beautiful project with Sam Shalabi, which I encourage everybody to listen to. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1028.08s)]
*  Love it. And we'll link to, you know, of course, musiciansforpalestine.com. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1037.1999999999998s)]
*  But as you know, and we'll also add links to your music, both of you, as well on the Electronic [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1044.0s)]
*  Intifada podcast blog post that accompanies this episode. Jesse Stein and Stéphane Christophe of [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1051.12s)]
*  Musicians for Palestine. Thank you both so much for coming on the Electronic Intifada podcast and [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1057.9199999999998s)]
*  keep us posted on this campaign. And coming up next, an interview with author and educator [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1063.04s)]
*  Mona Halabi about her new memoir, In My Mother's Footsteps, A Palestinian Refugee Returns Home. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1068.7199999999998s)]
*  Stay tuned. And welcome back to the Electronic Intifada podcast. Today, I'm delighted to be [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1074.56s)]
*  joined by Mona Hajar Halabi, a writer, educator, and the author of In My Mother's Footsteps, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1080.08s)]
*  A Palestinian Refugee Returns Home, which was published in early August. Mona, it's so good [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1086.6399999999999s)]
*  to see you and to have you on the podcast. Thank you so much for having me. It's my pleasure. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1091.84s)]
*  So let's dig into your book by first talking about your own family's history. Your memoir is about [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1098.1599999999999s)]
*  a series of displacements faced by multiple generations in Palestine, Lebanon, Egypt, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1105.04s)]
*  and how you found yourself back in Jerusalem as an adult, tracing your mother's childhood [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1112.16s)]
*  and living there for a year or so yourself. Can you give us a snapshot of your family's [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1117.44s)]
*  Palestinian story and what brought you back to Palestine? Yes, of course. You know, I grew up [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1122.08s)]
*  in exile basically as the daughter of a refugee and then later on a refugee myself from Egypt [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1130.08s)]
*  as a child. And the story that was prevalent in our household was my mother's Palestinian story. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1136.32s)]
*  My father did not feel Egyptian or Syrian. His family's from Syria. He was born in Alexandria, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1144.56s)]
*  Egypt. And so he did not speak very much about any sense of attachment to his homeland. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1151.12s)]
*  But my mother spoke about Palestine, told stories about Palestine. Some of them were sad and [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1158.56s)]
*  understandably, you know, nostalgic about the time she had there that was ripped away from her life. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1165.84s)]
*  Her home was, you know, taken away and she could never return to it after she had gone for what [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1173.76s)]
*  she thought was a couple of weeks until the bombing subsided. And then she couldn't return. So [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1180.32s)]
*  in many ways, her story was a story of loss, but she was such a good storyteller that she also [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1187.6s)]
*  told me all the things she loved about Palestine. And I became, you know, more and more, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1195.92s)]
*  you know, feverishly wanting to get the whole story before she's not with us anymore, which is, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1205.92s)]
*  you know, the race against time with that generation. She was born in 1923. So I interviewed [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1211.92s)]
*  her in 2003. And it was for what I at the time thought was what I wanted to create was a self [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1219.28s)]
*  published book about her life history. But in the meantime, as I was interviewing her and collecting [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1229.2s)]
*  all those stories from her, I have seven hours of audio tapes, which is wonderful. So I had a lot [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1235.76s)]
*  to go by. I was invited to teach conflict resolution and nonviolent communication at the Ramallah [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1241.92s)]
*  Friends School. And so I embarked on that and started to write a journal while I was there. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1249.2s)]
*  The journal, you know, encompassed my experiences firsthand of what I saw happening to the [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1255.76s)]
*  Palestinians under the brutality of the occupation. For now, I don't like to call it [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1262.08s)]
*  occupation anymore. I like to call it colonialism, because it's not occupation. Occupation is [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1268.56s)]
*  usually temporary, but this is the colonization of Palestine. And so I was very, I was in the midst [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1276.1599999999999s)]
*  of living that experience of what was happening, the harsh realities on the ground. But also, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1285.36s)]
*  I was falling in love with the people, the food, the generosity, the hospitality. And that's [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1291.2s)]
*  when I decided after I did, I had my year teaching at the Ramallah Friends School, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1299.8400000000001s)]
*  that I was going to be writing a book in two voices. My mother's story, I was lucky that [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1305.1200000000001s)]
*  she wrote to me nine letters, which are in the book. So you could hear her voice basically. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1310.48s)]
*  And my experience at the Ramallah Friends School and my search for, not my identity, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1317.1200000000001s)]
*  because I was already feeling very Palestinian. But, you know, it rooted me and I found an internal [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1322.48s)]
*  piece that I never had before, after living there for a year. So that's how it came about. And that's [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1330.24s)]
*  how I ended up there. Talk a little bit about your mother, Zakiya, and the neighborhood in Jerusalem [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1336.0s)]
*  that she grew up in and was expelled from. She lived in the lower Baqa, which is a neighborhood [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1343.6s)]
*  in West Jerusalem, one of several neighborhoods in West Jerusalem that were invaded and, you know, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1351.36s)]
*  confiscated by the state of Israel. They were not going to be, the partition plan from the United [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1360.08s)]
*  Nations in 1947 did not include West Jerusalem in the state of Israel. So they were conquered, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1367.6s)]
*  or, you know, you can use the verb that you want to use to say that they were taken illegally [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1376.24s)]
*  from the Palestinians. So that Baqa was one of them. There was lower Baqa, where my mother lived, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1383.04s)]
*  and there's upper Baqa, Katamon, Talbiye, the German colony, and the Greek colony. So they were [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1388.96s)]
*  clustered together. They were neighborhoods that were created at the end of the 19th century [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1398.08s)]
*  by Palestinians, Jerusalemites, who lived in the overcrowded and cold and, you know, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1407.76s)]
*  humid parts of the Old City, because the Old City is all stone, and there's very little greenery, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1416.96s)]
*  there's really no land. It's gorgeous, and you can see it in the photo in my background. You know, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1424.5600000000002s)]
*  I loved, I fell in love with the Old City, but for families, it was better for them to move outside [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1430.64s)]
*  of the walls of the Old City, and so those neighborhoods were created by predominantly [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1438.48s)]
*  Christian Palestinians, but Muslim Palestinians as well, and there were some Jewish Palestinian [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1444.96s)]
*  families as well that lived in those neighborhoods. My mother had a middle-class, you know, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1450.72s)]
*  upbringing. I would say they were, they were, they never had enough money, was not a family [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1458.8s)]
*  that was driven by financial success, but they were driven by intellectual success and stimulation, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1464.48s)]
*  and she had a lovely education at the Templar German colony school, which was a progressive [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1471.76s)]
*  school that was beyond belief for the 1920s and 30s. It reminded me, of course, of Park Day School, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1481.04s)]
*  where I taught for many years, and the Mills College Lab School, where I taught before Park Day, [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1488.9599999999998s)]
*  where children are learning from doing and from thinking critically, you know, rather than [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1494.9599999999998s)]
*  being dispensed knowledge and regurgitation, so she had that kind of open education. Her father had [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1501.76s)]
*  had studied at the University of Geneva in 1911, which is also something different. He was also [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1508.6399999999999s)]
*  from Jaffa, and he was a Muslim, a secular Muslim, who married a Catholic, and both families were [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1517.36s)]
*  totally happy with it, which, you know, when I think about it, in 1918 they got married. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1525.92s)]
*  My grandmother was eight years older than him, and they had the happiest marriage ever. Their parents [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1532.64s)]
*  got along super well with their respective parents, so they, my mother lived in an unconventional, [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1539.52s)]
*  modern, forward-thinking family, very tolerant family, and sometimes people think that I've [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1547.1200000000001s)]
*  become that way as a person because I live in Berkeley, but you know, it comes from way back, [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1555.04s)]
*  generations in my family, it's in my DNA, and so that neighborhood was lively. People went to the [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1560.6399999999999s)]
*  YMCA, which had concerts and sports activities and lectures and a library. My mother had a library [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1568.8s)]
*  card, and her brothers went there and borrowed books, and she sang in a band. Her brother played [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1577.76s)]
*  in that band, so it was a very rich and modern life. This was the urban Palestinian, and it's [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1585.44s)]
*  the minority when you think about it, because most of Palestine, 70 percent of Palestine before 1948, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1594.8799999999999s)]
*  was agrarian, you know, and so my mother was in that group of people that had access to education [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1601.36s)]
*  and to extracurricular activities, and sadly, you know, bombings started to happen already in 1946 [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1611.4399999999998s)]
*  with the bombing of the King David Hotel, the South Wing, which housed the Secretariat's office, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1622.4799999999998s)]
*  the British government's office, and almost 100 people perished in this bombing, so that started [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1629.2s)]
*  to destabilize, you know, the life in Jerusalem. After that, 1947 was the partition plan announcement [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1638.96s)]
*  from the UN, and that also brought about more strife between the Jews and the Arabs in Jerusalem [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1649.1200000000001s)]
*  and in other parts of Palestine, so they could see, my family, my mother's family could see the [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1656.88s)]
*  writing on the wall, things were not going well. They did not know, of course, the outcome. I had [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1666.0s)]
*  no idea that they would ever be expelled or driven out forcibly from their homes and never to be [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1671.1200000000001s)]
*  returned, so there were then bombings in their neighborhoods. There was the Hotel Samira Mies [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1680.8s)]
*  bombing in Katamon that affected a great deal the loss of this neighborhood that people just left [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1687.52s)]
*  and drove because they were just so worried about the safety of their children. And this was by the [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1697.52s)]
*  Haganah militia. Yeah, the Haganah, primarily the Irgun also a little bit, but the Haganah, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1704.96s)]
*  the paramilitary organization. So it was a very, very turbulent time, you know, young men like [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1713.28s)]
*  my older uncle, Dahud, used to, with his friends, you know, walk around the neighborhood in shifts [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1724.48s)]
*  at night just to make sure that there were no bombs placed around their houses. My mother wrote [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1732.0s)]
*  a letter in my book about that I have in my book and she describes how tense and hard that was. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1739.36s)]
*  My other younger, my mother's other brother, the younger one, was very stressed out. It was like PTSD [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1746.96s)]
*  every time he heard any noise, he thought it was an attack and he was, you know, struggling with [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1754.4s)]
*  that. It's obviously a stressor, a very big one. And so my grandfather said to my mother, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1760.72s)]
*  take your brother Afif, the one who was suffering from PTSD and go to Egypt to stay with your aunt [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1768.72s)]
*  for a couple of weeks until things calm down. And of course, we know the story, things did not calm [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1777.44s)]
*  down or did not allow Palestinian families, 750,000 plus Palestinian families lost home, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1784.8s)]
*  property. My mother and her family did not own their home, but they lost their home. They lost [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1794.8s)]
*  all their belongings, their beautiful books. My grandfather was a scholar and he had a lovely [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1801.36s)]
*  collection. And that collection is now at the university, Hebrew University in Jerusalem, [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1806.96s)]
*  labeled abandoned property. Well, it wasn't abandoned, you know. In my family's case, [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1814.0s)]
*  in particular, the tragedy is that my uncle who was in the house after the creation of the state [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1820.0s)]
*  of Israel, he remained there, my uncle Dahud, and he was attacked basically by Israeli soldiers on [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1827.12s)]
*  the 22nd of May. So a week after the creation of the state of Israel, handcuffed, blindfolded, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1836.48s)]
*  and thrown into the back of a truck, his dog was killed in front of him. And he was taken to a labor [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1843.28s)]
*  camp in Adli, which is south of Haifa, for about a year. So he was missing for a year, which was [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1852.08s)]
*  very hard on my mother and on my uncle, the other uncle, and my grandfather. So sometimes people, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1859.44s)]
*  will say to me, well, you left as though it was something by choice. The Palestinians did not [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1868.32s)]
*  lead by choice. Either they were terrified by the bombings and wanted to make sure their families [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1875.1999999999998s)]
*  were safe, or they were abducted like my uncle to vacate the neighborhood. All the other young men [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1880.6399999999999s)]
*  in the neighborhood had the same fate. They were also handcuffed and blindfolded and dragged out [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1887.1999999999998s)]
*  of their homes. So the story was very, very tragic for my mother's family and for so many [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1894.48s)]
*  Palestinians. So we're not the only ones. The one thing I feel guilty about, and I write about that [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1904.0s)]
*  in the book, is that my family was able to recover with, they did not have money, but they recovered [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1910.64s)]
*  because they had family and they knew people and had connections. And my mother ended up meeting my [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1918.48s)]
*  father in Alexandria, marrying him. That's why I was born there. So it makes me feel guilty that we [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1925.44s)]
*  had these advantages, which so many Palestinians did not have. And so many of them are spending [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1933.52s)]
*  not only their lives, but their children's lives, their grandchildren's children's lives, [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1942.88s)]
*  generation after generation, now 73 years, of camps, refugee camps, which are overcrowded, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1946.8s)]
*  poor living conditions. The UN has schools in those camps and has and distributes [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1956.08s)]
*  humanitarian supplies, but it's not life. It's almost like you're living in limbo [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1964.6399999999999s)]
*  and you're constantly reminded of what was lost. And the younger generations want to return home [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1973.44s)]
*  because their parents, their grandparents are telling them those stories. And I'm glad about [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1981.7600000000002s)]
*  that. And I feel guilty that I'm not there. I have that guilt as well, that I'm outside, [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1986.4s)]
*  but I realized that being outside means I have a responsibility to tell the story and to educate [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=1994.5600000000002s)]
*  people and to help as much as I can through philanthropic organizations. So I have a [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2000.96s)]
*  responsibility even if I'm not there in person. Yeah. Yeah. Let's talk about teaching in Palestine. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2010.08s)]
*  And for full disclosure, I remember when you took your academic leave from Park Day School, [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2019.2s)]
*  because my own daughter was your student in third grade, just like a year or two after you came back. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2024.16s)]
*  In your memoir, you have these extraordinary stories about some of your students who were [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2029.52s)]
*  navigating growing up under the thumb of colonialism and occupation. As a teacher, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2034.16s)]
*  with everything you know about child development, talk about what your students experienced every [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2041.28s)]
*  day in Palestine and how that had shaped your work when you came back to Oakland. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2048.16s)]
*  You know, I was expecting that the children at the Ramallah Friends School or in any part of [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2053.92s)]
*  the occupied, colonized parts of Palestine would be suffering from stressors. I did not know enough [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2060.0800000000004s)]
*  about the children in Darfur or in Kosovo or in Africa and Congo, places where I know that [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2071.0400000000004s)]
*  children suffered in militarized zones and in areas that are war torn. So I did a lot of research. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2080.72s)]
*  I read a lot of UNESCO reports on the well-being of children. Doctors without borders had also [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2093.2s)]
*  done a lot of work for counseling families in Gaza, especially, of course. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2103.04s)]
*  And so I was preparing myself a little bit on how to handle that. I knew from the director [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2110.08s)]
*  that she was concerned because her students were so impulsive. They were hyperactive, impulsive. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2116.0s)]
*  They talked incessantly. They had a lot of fears. They were unable to focus in class. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2124.88s)]
*  And so I saw all those symptoms. They were very, very flagrant to me as a teacher who had been used [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2134.7999999999997s)]
*  to teaching in a more privileged part of the world, in a relatively safe part of the world in [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2144.0s)]
*  comparison where children could go out the door and go to school not fearing a bullet whizzing by [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2150.32s)]
*  them or an Israeli tank passing by. So when I went there, I saw that the children were suffering. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2158.4s)]
*  And I saw how the city is under this false sense of safety. You walk in Ramallah, you go to a cafe, [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2167.84s)]
*  you have a chat with a friend. You have that, but then you have the jeeps with the soldiers [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2178.08s)]
*  passing by. Sometimes they shoot at people. And while I was there, a 16-year-old was shot in the [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2189.28s)]
*  street and killed. And there was a memorial on the sidewalk there, which reminded me every day of this [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2195.52s)]
*  innocent life that was taken just because he was standing on the sidewalk. So [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2203.76s)]
*  that must bring about for all children when this boy died. We talked a lot about that in the class [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2211.28s)]
*  meetings that I was having with the children. This sense of, you know, I can't be safe if I'm outside. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2217.12s)]
*  I can't be safe anywhere. The parents also are very, very attached to their children [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2223.2s)]
*  in a healthy way, but also sometimes in an unhealthy way, because they're not [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2232.0s)]
*  permitting their children to move on to the next stage of development to become more autonomous, [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2238.56s)]
*  because there is no way of controlling the environment and making sure that they're safe. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2244.16s)]
*  So it was clear to me that there was work to be done. And my work was limited because [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2250.3999999999996s)]
*  I'm not a qualified psychotherapist. I know a lot about child development and I understood, [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2258.32s)]
*  understand young children, but I knew that sometimes the issues were larger than what I [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2264.96s)]
*  could offer, that children and their families need some counseling and some support in ways that I [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2271.1200000000003s)]
*  could not provide. But we had a counselor at the Ramallah Friends School, which is a wonderful [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2279.44s)]
*  thing, that the school has a full-time counselor, Adele, and she worked a great deal with me. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2285.6s)]
*  We conducted class meetings together and she also provided children with what they call life skills, [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2291.7599999999998s)]
*  which are very good skills for critical thinking, making good choices, so on and so forth, which [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2299.12s)]
*  added to the conflict resolution, because the children would resort to fist fighting and [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2306.48s)]
*  shoving and pushing when they could not communicate to the other, you know, their grievance. And I feel [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2315.2s)]
*  that a lot of it, of course, comes from frustration. They're very frustrated, but also from what they [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2324.48s)]
*  see on the news, what they see in the streets. So it was a challenging job and I did the best I could [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2332.24s)]
*  and they continue doing class meetings, so that makes me very happy that the seeds I planted are [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2341.28s)]
*  continuing to grow there. But there's a limit to what we can do, you know, which was a hard lesson. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2347.2000000000003s)]
*  I also want to say that I was worried going there with my theories and my ideas, because [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2356.0800000000004s)]
*  I wanted to be respectful of what was there. I did not want to come, you know, like a colonial [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2365.68s)]
*  power, you know, trying to bring about change and meddling. So it's a very risky thing when you go [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2373.68s)]
*  to help people in troubled areas economically or politically. I went with the sense that I'm going [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2381.92s)]
*  to learn and grow a great deal from that experience, but that I was also going to be respectful [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2392.7999999999997s)]
*  and not meddle in their ways, but offer possibilities and options and solutions that could help. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2398.3199999999997s)]
*  That's beautiful. I want to talk a little bit about your mother and have you read a little bit [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2411.52s)]
*  from the book as well. But first, you took your mother back to Palestine at the very end of her [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2421.3599999999997s)]
*  life, along with your husband David, your father and other family members. It's such a moving part [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2427.3599999999997s)]
*  of your book. So much had changed since she was a child in Jerusalem and now you were able to [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2432.56s)]
*  be her guide. You talk about that and bring her back to some of her roots there. Can you talk [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2439.36s)]
*  about that experience a little bit? Yes, it was a very moving experience for me, [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2444.96s)]
*  and poignant too, because I had so much wanted her to show me Jerusalem with her own eyes, you know, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2453.6s)]
*  take me to her home. And of course, the old city had remained the same. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2462.4s)]
*  So she could take me to her grandmother's house, my great grandmother. And that was lovely. But [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2467.04s)]
*  West Jerusalem has changed a great deal now. And I was the one then who was able to guide her. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2473.84s)]
*  But she had given me very good instructions a few years prior on how to find her mother's house, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2481.12s)]
*  which had helped me. And I write about that in the book. So I took her to her house and I [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2487.36s)]
*  took her to her house and she, you know, she amazed me, Nora, she was, I thought she might [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2495.44s)]
*  become angry because you think about someone who returns to some place that was taken away from her. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2506.2400000000002s)]
*  But instead, she came with such an open heart. For her, it was it was like, meeting again an [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2513.28s)]
*  old friend she hadn't seen for years. She was touching the stones, rubbing her hands on the [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2521.28s)]
*  stones on the outside of the house, you know, sliding her fingers down the wrought iron, [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2528.0s)]
*  iron work in front of the windows. She stood there in front of the house and I asked to take her [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2536.4s)]
*  photograph and to me that photograph, which is in the book and on my mantelpiece. She looks, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2543.76s)]
*  you know, so much younger than her age. She was 84, but I mean, she looks 20 years, [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2549.92s)]
*  30 years younger because she has this broad smile on her face and her eyes are glittering. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2555.44s)]
*  So that was very, very moving. So she was an amazing woman and I hope I'm half as, [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2562.96s)]
*  half my mother's, you know, I have half of her humanity. I would be happy if I have half of that. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2571.84s)]
*  And I would be happy if you had that house back. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2577.7599999999998s)]
*  Yes, of course. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2582.88s)]
*  I would love for you to read some of your book, you know, just like the and once again, just, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2586.08s)]
*  you know, the importance of oral and written history at the time of the deliberate destruction [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2595.44s)]
*  of Palestinian life, you know, around historic Palestine at that time and, you know, how you [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2601.28s)]
*  were able to weave your mother's intricate detailed stories of her childhood into what you were [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2610.6400000000003s)]
*  experiencing, you know, just what, three, five, six decades later. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2618.5600000000004s)]
*  Yes, I chose, I thought a lot about what I wanted to read and I think I wanted to read a piece that [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2625.84s)]
*  had to do with my arriving there and some of the shocks and the pleasures I had in being an ordinary [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2635.28s)]
*  Palestinian. It's in the section called An Ordinary Palestinian. I quickly learned how to live the life [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2645.92s)]
*  of an ordinary Palestinian. Buying my hot loaves of pita bread at the bakery down the street, [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2654.24s)]
*  a bar of olive oil soap at the corner market, or half a kilo of cucumbers from farmers in their [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2660.8799999999997s)]
*  traditional embroidered dresses sitting with their woven baskets on the steps inside Damascus gate. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2668.0s)]
*  Living in Jerusalem meant being awakened at five in the morning by the loud speakers atop the mosques [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2676.0s)]
*  that emitted the languid melodious call to prayers and on Sunday mornings, like the joyful [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2683.04s)]
*  laughter of children, the medley of church bells. But the reality of living in Jerusalem also meant [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2689.68s)]
*  facing life under Israeli occupation, crossing checkpoints, navigating the separation wall, [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2696.8s)]
*  witnessing my people brutalized and dehumanized. My American passport was a source of conflicting [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2704.0s)]
*  feelings. On the one hand, it buffered me and gained me access to places not permitted to [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2710.64s)]
*  local Palestinians, but on the other hand, it separated me from the native population, [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2717.12s)]
*  hampering me from living as a true Palestinian. At times I felt guilty for holding in my hands [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2723.2s)]
*  this little slim blue book with its golden eagle embossed on the front that allowed me many [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2730.8799999999997s)]
*  advantages. One day returning on the bus to Jerusalem from the village of Bejela, [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2737.12s)]
*  we were stopped at the checkpoint and asked to descend from the bus with our bags and belongings. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2743.52s)]
*  We stood in a long line and watched the young blonde Israeli soldier, dark glasses shielding [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2750.48s)]
*  her face, her hair pulled back under a khaki military cap. She condescendingly snapped at [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2756.08s)]
*  the Palestinians in front of me while fingering the edges of their IDs with visible disgust, [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2762.56s)]
*  as though she feared some sort of contamination. When my turn came, she glanced at the cover of [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2769.2s)]
*  my blue American passport and didn't even open it. With the same hard face, she asked me something [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2775.92s)]
*  in Hebrew. I grimaced and asked, what did you say? Where do you come from? She asked with a strong [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2783.2s)]
*  Eastern European accent. I'm from California. She waved me back and onto the bus, blindly honoring [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2790.08s)]
*  the US passport. How could it be easier for a US passport holder to travel around this land than [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2797.6s)]
*  someone whose whole family has lived here for generations? But the Palestinian spirit is [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2805.2799999999997s)]
*  resolute. Against all odds, the Palestinians have survived the occupation and over 70 years of [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2811.6s)]
*  displacement in this procession. They are not thriving, for who could thrive when a 20-foot [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2818.48s)]
*  concrete wall is erected outside your window, separating you from your crops and your family, [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2824.88s)]
*  let alone blocking your share of sunlight? And who could thrive when turned back from the checkpoint [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2830.96s)]
*  to enter Jerusalem for medical treatment? And who could thrive when your home is demolished in the [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2836.96s)]
*  middle of the night and you are given only half an hour's notice to carry your sleeping children [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2843.12s)]
*  out of bed? The things we take for granted in America are things Palestinians have to fight for [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2848.64s)]
*  every day of their lives. Yet they continue to battle the injustices inflicted upon them [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2855.12s)]
*  in nonviolent ways by getting up every morning to tend to their office jobs, their sheep, their olive [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2861.12s)]
*  trees, their students, their patients. They line up for hours at Kalandia Checkpoint in Ramallah [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2867.6s)]
*  or Khawara Checkpoint in Nablus to be given permission to go about the daily business of [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2874.0s)]
*  living. They stand quietly and obediently at checkpoints that divide up their country into [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2879.8399999999997s)]
*  parcels while humiliated by young, early soldiers half their age. But Palestinians are strong and [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2885.6s)]
*  tough, like saber, the cactus plant growing in their indigenous land and which also means an [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2893.92s)]
*  Arabic patience and endurance. Not only have they survived the ferocity of the occupation, [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2900.64s)]
*  but they have also done it with dignity and pride. They will not surrender their struggle for liberation. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCvaN_PUmuA&t=2907.2000000000003s)]
