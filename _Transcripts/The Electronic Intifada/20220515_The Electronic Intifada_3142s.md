Video Description: On episode 57, we speak with members of the NDN Collective about their recently released position paper on Palestinian liberation – “The Right of Return is LANDBACK.”
Krystal Two Bulls, Demetrius Johnson and Nadya Tannous of the NDN Collective tell us that the resistance by Indigenous peoples to the US’ centuries-long programs of ethnic cleansing and forced relocation is strengthened by Palestinian resistance to Israeli settler-colonialism.
“Our peoples are 500 plus years into this, and we’re still resisting, we’re still fighting, we’re still holding on to our ways, our cultures, our language, our spirituality, and we’re still fighting to reclaim our relationship with the land,” says Two Bulls.
“When we’re talking about Palestine, being 74 years into settler-colonialism, and we’re seeing escalated oppression moving straight into an apartheid state, I think it’s important that we look at that, because when Palestinians go home, that means us – as Indigenous peoples here on Turtle Island – we are then closer to what our vision of sovereignty and liberation and freedom is,” she explains.

Two Bulls and Tannous began organizing together at the Standing Rock protest in 2016, when Indigenous communities led a months-long confrontation against the US government’s plans to build the Dakota Access Pipeline under the Missouri River, a natural water supply for the Standing Rock Sioux tribe.
Palestinians expressed their support and solidarity with the resistance at Standing Rock.
“Part of the commitment is not just to have an analysis around what Indigenous sovereignty and liberation looks like and what our responsibility is as people who live on this land – and also as people who have been dispossessed and are actively being dispossessed by the same monsters and same systems, the same imperialist force,” Tannous explains, “but to really confront US imperialism from the first frontline, which is Native communities.”
She adds, “That’s where the US military was developed. And without that, without the United States military marauding against Krystal’s people, against Demetrius’ people, we would not have US imperialism.”
Johnson, who also works with The Red Nation, talks about participating in a 2018 delegation to Palestine. The trip was organized by Palestinian Youth Movement and led by Tannous.
Being on the ground in Palestine, he says, helped inform his work on the position paper.
“It was literally just like home,” he says. “These are the same sights and sounds and landscapes like I see at home. I felt no disconnection.”
He explains that recognizing “the care and the history and the connection that our Palestinian relatives have taken in educating not only themselves but the people here on Turtle Island [is] what we really wanted to weave into the paper too – how would we explain this issue to our relatives?”

*  Joining us to talk about this is Crystal Tubals, Demetrius Johnson, and Nadia Tanouss of the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=61.96s)]
*  Indian Collective. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  Thank you all for being with us today on the Electronic Intifada Podcast. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  Thanks for having us, Nora. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  Yes, thank you. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, what's up, everyone? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  Well, Crystal, let's start with you. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  You're the campaign director for Land Back with the NDN Collective. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  The position paper begins with an outline of parallel histories of settler colonialism [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=84.96s)]
*  on this continent and in Palestine and three and a half centuries after the genocide of [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=90.96s)]
*  Indigenous peoples on this continent began by European colonists. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=95.96s)]
*  It talks about the 1830 Indian Removal Act, which was a measure that was, as the paper [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=99.96s)]
*  says, designed to cut relationships Native peoples had with the land by removing us, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=105.96s)]
*  destroying our homes, our medicines, our crops, our livestock, and killing any who [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=111.96s)]
*  resisted. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=117.96s)]
*  Since the passing of the Indian Removal Act and U.S. expansion out west, the popular Wild [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=118.96s)]
*  West trope began where settlers positioned themselves as saviors and us as savages. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=123.96s)]
*  And of course, this is so incredibly similar to the Zionist colonization plans and practices [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=129.95999999999998s)]
*  of legalized forced removal of Palestinians from their land. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=135.96s)]
*  Can you talk about the significance of connecting these histories of colonial violence and the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=140.96s)]
*  purpose of the Palestine position paper? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=147.96s)]
*  Yeah, very sick. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=152.96s)]
*  Thank you for the introduction. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=154.96s)]
*  And I'm really excited to be here. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=156.96s)]
*  But, you know, our campaign is only like two and a half years old. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=158.96s)]
*  We're still a relatively new movement or relatively new campaign. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=162.96s)]
*  And but I think from day one, whenever we launched the campaign, I knew that we would deepen [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=167.96s)]
*  our relationship with Palestine. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=174.96s)]
*  I knew that that would be a priority for us. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=176.96s)]
*  And I knew it was something that we would center in our campaign. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=179.96s)]
*  And the reason one is obviously from my personal relationships and connections, you know, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=182.96s)]
*  with Palestinian entities who had like invested in me and taught me friendships with like Nadia [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=188.96s)]
*  and, you know, those ties, but also, you know, larger than all of that is also the fact that, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=193.96s)]
*  you know, and we name this in the position paper of like settler colonialism has a playbook [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=199.96s)]
*  in our oppressors. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=204.96s)]
*  They communicate with each other. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=206.96s)]
*  They they collaborate with each other. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=208.96s)]
*  They communicate. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=210.96s)]
*  They work across. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=211.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=212.96s)]
*  And so for us as peoples who are targeted by this, by settler colonialism, it's important that we also communicate, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=213.96s)]
*  that we also collaborate, that we also build together and that we know the histories and that we understand, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=220.96s)]
*  you know, the various different timelines that exist with settler colonialism. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=227.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=231.96s)]
*  So our peoples are 500 plus years into this, you know, and we're still resisting. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=232.96s)]
*  We're still fighting. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=237.96s)]
*  We're still holding on to our ways, our cultures, our language, our spirituality. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=238.96s)]
*  And we're still fighting to reclaim our relationship with the land. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=242.96s)]
*  And so I think that when we're talking about Palestine being seventy five, seventy four years into settler colonialism, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=245.96s)]
*  and we're seeing like an escalated, you know, an escalated oppression, right, moving straight into an apartheid state. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=252.96s)]
*  And so I think it's important that we look at that, because when when Palestinians go home, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=261.96000000000004s)]
*  that means us as indigenous peoples here on Turtle Island, we are then closer to what our vision of sovereignty and liberation and freedom is. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=267.96s)]
*  Right. And so I think that it doesn't it's not this like separate movement. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=276.96s)]
*  It's not a separate thing that we're focusing on or like, you know, what some may think like is this like different struggle that's over there, out there. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=281.96s)]
*  But it's actually something that's very close to home. We know what that process looks like. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=289.96s)]
*  We survived all of that. And now watching our siblings go through those processes as well. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=294.96s)]
*  It is our responsibility to show up. It is our responsibility to like say, hey, this is how it played out with us. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=299.96s)]
*  This is what happened with us. We don't have to do these things again. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=306.96s)]
*  We can actually just like cut straight to what we need to cut to. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=309.96s)]
*  So I think that it's key for indigenous peoples as well here and here on Turtle Island to be in solidarity and to like not just be allies, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=313.96s)]
*  not just be co-conspirators, but to be relatives and to take this fight and the struggle on as our own in the position paper. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=323.96s)]
*  That's the intention that we've woven through the entire piece. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=330.96s)]
*  Thank you. Nadia, tell us a little bit about the process of putting this position paper together and how you've been working across Turtle Island, the present day U.S. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=335.96s)]
*  with Native communities to strengthen and solidify these important bonds, not just theoretically, but in practice. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=346.96s)]
*  So I think I'll start with how I ended up at the LAMBAC campaign as a LAMBAC organizer. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=354.96s)]
*  It really is through personal relationships. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=362.96s)]
*  Crystal and I actually started to organize with each other at Standing Rock, but we never met in person. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=365.96s)]
*  And then we ended up meeting at Peneasco, New Mexico about a year later. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=372.96s)]
*  And it just, you know, things developed, right? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=379.96s)]
*  Because part of the commitment is, like you said, not just to have an analysis around what indigenous sovereignty and liberation looks like and what our responsibility is as people who live on this land. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=386.96s)]
*  And also as people who have been dispossessed and are actively being dispossessed by the same monsters and same systems, the same imperialist force, but to really confront U.S. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=400.96s)]
*  imperialism from the first front line, which is Native communities. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=413.96s)]
*  That's where the U.S. military was developed. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=419.96s)]
*  And without that, without the United States military marauding against Crystal's people, against Demetrius' people, we would not have U.S. imperialism. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=422.96s)]
*  And so I think, you know, Demetrius and I also go way back. Demetrius was one of the delegates on the Palestinian youth movement's indigenous youth delegation to Palestine. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=432.96s)]
*  And so we met back when the PYM and Red Nation were collabing. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=443.96s)]
*  And so I take that really seriously because it means that those commitments and kind of your reference points are driven by the needs and the demands of the people that you know and the communities that they come from. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=449.96s)]
*  We are all grassroots organizers who are deeply invested and committed with our home communities or to our own communities. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=461.96s)]
*  So in terms of the, you know, coming to the LAMBAC campaign, I think the LAMBAC, you know, LAMBAC is a people's demand, right? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=468.96s)]
*  And the collective and the campaign is a facet of that, being able to actually carry that. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=478.96s)]
*  We're able every day to come to our work from being grassroots organizers to now being able to try and think about what it means to be accountable to the front line, what it means to be able to resource LAMBAC struggles, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=482.96s)]
*  like the one where you and I live, Nora, the West Berkeley shell mound, for example, right? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=495.96s)]
*  And so many struggles are happening across the island. So in terms of the paper, it was pretty natural. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=502.96s)]
*  So coming to the LAMBAC campaign, as Crystal said, you know, she had really prioritized Palestine and talking about how this needed to be focused on. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=510.96s)]
*  This needs to be actively built out as part of the ongoing and natural and intentional reciprocal process between movements and that process as the paper lays out between the historic commitments and the historic relationships between [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=519.96s)]
*  the indigenous liberation movements and Palestinian movements in the spirit of internationalism and in the spirit of global indigenous solidarity. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=534.96s)]
*  And I think this was the second paper. Our first paper was demilitarism is decolonization or demilitarization is decolonization, really tackling militarism and militarization within indigenous communities and around the world, right? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=543.96s)]
*  And I think, you know, one of my favorite stories that we uplifted and something that I also think this paper gives back a lot to Palestinian communities is some of the history that we maybe don't talk about or don't know about, but stories that I learned when the Palestinian youth movements delegations went to Standing Rock and we were taught by, you know, Lakota elders. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=560.96s)]
*  When we showed up, we're like, where the heck have you all been? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=585.96s)]
*  We're like, wait, you guys know us? What do you mean? And they were like, yeah, you all showed up here, then we haven't seen you in a while. We're like, oh my God. And it's that story of the Palestinian movement, right, and Palestinian leaders coming to Standing Rock specifically for the first [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=589.96s)]
*  International Indigenous Treaty Council and really thinking through what it meant to try and utilize different strategies for liberation. One of them is the United Nations Declaration for the Rights of Indigenous People and looking at the United Nations as one mechanism for liberation, you know, as a tool, right, in the larger movement, even as we as Palestinians don't use it, you know, on an international level, we invested in developing out that strategy for our siblings with our [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=605.96s)]
*  siblings based off of our experiences. So I wanted to uplift that because I think that's the spirit of this paper. It's not transactional. It really is stepping in what it means to be a good relative, what it means to be a principled and a principled struggle, and what it means to uplift, to know and to unite with each other. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=635.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=656.96s)]
*  Demetrius, I want to pull you into the conversation as well. Can you tell us a little bit about your work with the Indian Collective and the Land Back Movement and what you feel are maybe some of the most key or significant points in this paper? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=657.96s)]
*  Yeah, so, you know, me and Nadia got hired, you know, within a week of each other. And so to me, like, you know, the Land Back Movement, I've learned from memers. You know, I was involved in the meme community for a little bit. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=676.96s)]
*  I was talking with some First Nation homies, some Indigenous youth, and yeah, that's like, you know, they kind of popularized what Land Back means. And so for me, like, coming into this campaign, I kind of already had like my own idea of what Land Back means. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=694.96s)]
*  I mean, it's like not a complicated definition. It's just literally just like, you know, give us the land back, all the land back. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=709.96s)]
*  Yes, all the land, yeah. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=715.96s)]
*  But, you know, Indian Collective's, you know, the history of like how this campaign came to be, you know, started from right here, where we're at right now, Hezapa, and, you know, protecting this land and protecting that sacred site, the Black Hills. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=720.96s)]
*  And, you know, I remember like, because I've been a part of the Red Nation for seven years now. And, you know, kind of just like, you know, watching other like Indigenous movements and like keeping an eye on Indian Collective and actually seeing like the action go down live. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=737.96s)]
*  And that was like my first like connection or like, you know, like who is Crystal Tupols? And I just see her just like on top of the vehicle, just like shouting. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=754.96s)]
*  You see like Nick Tilson and I don't know, like just seeing like the origins of like where this Land Back campaign came from. And finally, like, I never, you know, me personally, I never met Crystal or talked with Crystal really until like my interview for this position. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=767.96s)]
*  And, you know, just actually seeing like, you know, the living legend, but also like, you know, Crystal telling me, oh, like we're actually thinking of getting Nadia on the team too. And I was like, what Nadia? Like the crew is coming together. Like what a squad. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=785.96s)]
*  So, you know, like, you know, Indian Collective Land Back campaign, we, that is like the cornerstone of like what we're organizing around, like actually like why we're here is, you know, the reclamation of Hey Sapa. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=801.96s)]
*  And that's like the main thing that we're, you know, focused on and like from there, like we believe like it's going to be, it's going to blow up. Like if we can reclaim Hey Sapa, if we can reclaim the Black Hills, like that opens up so many other doors and avenues for, you know, other [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=814.96s)]
*  other indigenous people to reclaim their sacred sites. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=829.96s)]
*  But, you know, other than that, like, you know, we got, we got our narrative, which, you know, right now we're working on our land back magazine. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=834.96s)]
*  Hopefully be released by the end of this year. That's like the goal we're going towards indigenous peoples day so keep an eye out, which will be about Hey Sapa. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=842.96s)]
*  Our political education which Nadia upholds, and are both of us really kind of like, that's like our main like bread and butter work. Nadia does our land back you. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=852.96s)]
*  It's like an online platform to free online educational platform talking about, you know, like different struggles around Turtle Island off Turtle Island, and how grassroots and frontline communities are, you know, reclaiming land or what all that means for the people [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=865.96s)]
*  doing that work. And alongside with the, with, with the land back you work is our position papers, which is this is this is one of them. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=884.96s)]
*  And also like we know we resource our frontline communities we do movement support, and also [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=896.96s)]
*  our land back agenda. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=905.96s)]
*  You know, it's a, it's another piece of work that we're you know, another reason why we're here just you know delving into like how do we. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=908.96s)]
*  One like, how, how do we get land back through through education through resistance through like mobilization but also how do we do it like on different fronts, because there's no there's a bunch of different ways but two different tactics that you can use to to get land back [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=916.96s)]
*  back and, you know, like we're not trying to be a. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=933.96s)]
*  What do you call it like a one trip pony out here. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=938.96s)]
*  But my, my involvement in this position paper really came from my long. Well, on the web, I know that's long but just me being like in this movement space for the past seven years with the red nation and a lot of political education a lot of understanding [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=943.96s)]
*  like what, like what the Palestinian resistance means to indigenous people. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=961.96s)]
*  And then it wasn't until 2018, where I was in connection with Nadia and the Palestinian youth movement they're like hey like we're trying to get someone from red nation to go on a delegation to Palestine like who's down to go and the red nation just just like this [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=966.96s)]
*  guy's gone. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=982.96s)]
*  I don't know like up until that point like I didn't understand, like, it's a whole different realization when like you're just like some red kid from Canada like, and you just read about, you know, what is happening around the world, but you know you're kind of [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=984.96s)]
*  just like within like your own your own backyard within like your own little bubble. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=999.96s)]
*  But when you actually see like what's happening globally with what's happening to other indigenous people and making those connections because my connections really came from like landscapes. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1005.96s)]
*  When we first landed in Tel Aviv and went to our hostels like it was like midnight it was like one o'clock in the morning. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1019.96s)]
*  And then like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, you know [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1027.96s)]
*  And I was like, wow, like, this is, this is eye opening, but also, you know, just, it's really inspiring to knowing that the care and the history and the connection that the Palestinian, our Palestinian relatives have taken in, in educating not only themselves but like, you know, the people here on a, on Turtle Island. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1057.96s)]
*  And I don't know. I think that's like what we really wanted to like weave into the paper too is, you know, like, how, how would we explain this issue to our relatives, how would we explain this issue to our grandmas or cousins or uncles or aunties like that's who we really wanted to gear this paper for. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1083.96s)]
*  But, yeah. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1102.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's beautiful and I do want to ask you, you know more about your experience on the ground in Palestine. In a moment, but I want to go back to you Crystal. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1107.96s)]
*  Tell us a little bit about. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1118.96s)]
*  Well, I want to talk about the Palestinian right of return and the land back movement and how they are to, you know, sides of the same sphere. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1121.96s)]
*  And what is the land back movement and how, you know, I mean like when you say yes, yes all the land. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1130.96s)]
*  You know this like immediate automatic vilification by the settler state around that and the extraordinary panic that settlers and the, you know, people in power, kind of express about that, which is exactly what we see in Palestine when we talk about the right of return. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1138.96s)]
*  Can you talk a little bit about the, the land back movement, and really it's it's it's kind of practical implications and applications, and and how it's connected to the Palestinian right of return. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1159.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1174.96s)]
*  So that's the whole paper. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1176.96s)]
*  But, um, in terms of like what is land back I think that's always like a really good starting point for conversations and I think, you know, land back is the literal reclamation of land. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1181.96s)]
*  Right. And it's also the reclamation everything stolen from us when we were forced to be removed. Right. And so that means acknowledging that we were fully thriving economies and societies and communities pre colonization. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1192.96s)]
*  And so when we're talking about land back, you know with the land also comes the reclamation of like ceremony and language and culture spirituality, but also like governance systems kinship systems how we relate to each other, education, food security [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1206.96s)]
*  health care, housing, all of these things centered on our relationship to the land and so when we're talking about land back. We're talking about reclaiming all of those things. And those things were specifically targeted and severed for a reason, right like by design, everything that we are experiencing in our communities [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1221.96s)]
*  to this day, the high rates of diabetes the high rates of like high school dropout suicide drug and alcohol abuse violence domestic abuse, all of these things. They all have a root. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1239.96s)]
*  And all of them go back and I could probably spend a lot of time going through each one of those things and tracing it back to when we are forced to remove the land. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1252.96s)]
*  It all started then, and that's by design. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1260.96s)]
*  You know, there's intention put into that. And so, if there's going to be a social justice movement anywhere on these lands, then has to start with land back. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1263.96s)]
*  That is the root. That is how this so called country was founded. And so that's what land back represents. It represents reclaiming relationship reclaiming the land reclaiming who we are ultimately at the end of the day that's what it is that's all of those things [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1274.96s)]
*  are who we are. So it makes us who we are. But it's also it's also a reckoning. And it's also claiming justice. Right. And so for us that's that's what we're working towards with land back. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1289.96s)]
*  You know and through our campaign, we do have like a heavy focus and emphasis on like public lands. Right, because we know that national parks were not created for general public use and to save this pristine landscape the way that they like to push out in their [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1302.96s)]
*  narratives, but we know that national parks were created to strategically keep native peoples from their land. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1317.96s)]
*  Every national park that exists exists right next to a nation that exists a fully thriving people in that land was strategically placed in a national park to keep us from that. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1324.96s)]
*  And so we do have a focus on public lands. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1335.96s)]
*  But that doesn't mean that land back doesn't also include private own lands, church on glands military own lands because those two are the largest landowners in the world. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1338.96s)]
*  Not just here in the so called us the world, right, the Catholic Church in the military. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1349.96s)]
*  And so, thinking about that, you know, there are those that, excuse me, organize in that way, you know, and we see many different ways to reclaim land. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1354.96s)]
*  You know it's happening through legislation it's happening through occupation nonviolent action through lawsuits, through purchasing land through gifting of land co ops are being created land trusts are being created land taxes, you know, and like even like co management, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1363.96s)]
*  which is not land back, but it is a door that's opening towards land back right renaming of places and spaces is not land back, but it moves us in that direction. Right. And so, you know, we're seeing land back happen in many different ways and there is no one template for that. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1380.96s)]
*  But I think the way that it applies is that's the exact same thing happening in Palestine is that disconnection from culture from spirituality from from our four legged relatives from the plants from from the languages. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1397.96s)]
*  And so, you know, all of those things it's a very specific way of being targeted that separates and severs that relationship. Right. And then the hope is is that you know colonizers can come in and just like lay over the top of all of the things that existed before and just like prop up a so [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1412.96s)]
*  you know, and so I think that that's the connecting piece is that we see the same process and so earlier when I said that settler colonialism has a playbook. We've seen this play before. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1430.96s)]
*  And so now that we've seen it, when we collaborate and we work together, then we can address that, you know, and we can we can adjust tactic, we can adjust strategy, and we can build together and show up for each other in a way that prevents the levels of harm, right and the [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1441.96s)]
*  in the generations that my peoples have had to experience trauma, right to get us to this point here today. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1457.96s)]
*  And so, yeah, those are the those are the connecting pieces and yeah so when we're looking at right every turn that's exactly what right every turn is asking for is the same exact thing that land back is asking for. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1464.96s)]
*  Right, I mean, you know, talking about the national parks here in the so called us I mean, Nadia and I both know intimately, how the you know that the Israeli lands authority they call it, and the Jewish National Fund worked together to, you know, not only like [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1476.96s)]
*  like ethnically cleanse Palestinian villages entire areas and regions of Palestine, but then they, you know, like, literally planted forests on top of the ruins of villages and called it a national park in order to somehow prevent, not just like the return to [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1495.96s)]
*  the land, but the, you know, the memory, the historical legacy of the people who were there, you know, just a generation before. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1515.96s)]
*  It's it's astounding. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1529.96s)]
*  So, what did you say about the delegation that that you took Demetrius on and other native people. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1532.96s)]
*  And, and what was it like for you as a Palestinian American. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1541.96s)]
*  You know on this delegation of indigenous folks. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1546.96s)]
*  So the indigenous youth delegation to Palestine was developed out of work that PYM had been engaging in across rural island, really, since our inception as a UN United States chapter right in the Bay Area. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1551.96s)]
*  And we learned a lot, you know, through our black Mesa delegation delegation of black Mesa. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1571.96s)]
*  And 2012 2013. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1577.96s)]
*  And then, you know, moving into local them back struggles. When we went to Standing Rock we made that commitment to be on the ground from think the first delegation we sent was in August. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1582.96s)]
*  So we were on the ground and made the commitment to be there from September all the way till the end whenever that would be that we said seven months we can commit to seven months. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1598.96s)]
*  And when we propose the indigenous youth delegation, we actually were talking with crystal. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1609.96s)]
*  And I were talking with crystal about what it looks like to actually do this. Right. So, saying okay, we're, we're, it's never enough right we're taking our responsibility we're trying right to say what does it mean for Palestinians to show up on the [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1617.96s)]
*  And we're trying to make sure that we're not just saying yes okay we're we're living here in exile on stolen land, but to really take up the responsibility of what I think and what I was taught it means to be Palestinian, which is that we fight [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1632.96s)]
*  for whatever we are, we don't just fight for ourselves. Right. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1654.96s)]
*  That's in our practice that's in who we are. That's in how we've struggled. And so, I feel really lucky to come from a people who we have a history of internationalism, we carry that was such, you know, pride. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1659.96s)]
*  We also, you know, have to take up the responsibility in order to step into that right can't just say it, you have to think about it and do it right. So that's what the indigenous youth delegation was about. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1672.96s)]
*  We've been here hosted on these lands right and with people, what does it mean to take indigenous youth from Turtle Island in the kingdom of Hawaii home with us, what does it mean for us to literally try to live and build with each other, what we ran into were some [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1683.96s)]
*  difficulties, you know, one was grassroots funding the entire delegation as with any pym project is 100% grassroots funded and plane tickets to, you know, lead airport so called Tel Aviv is is tough, right. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1699.96s)]
*  And we also ran into the structural issues of oppression that native people live under every day, the issues of passports for example the issue of previous incarceration and strange fines that you know prevented people from leaving the so called country. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1714.96s)]
*  And a lot of things came up as a barrier, but in the end, you know, the, the, the way that we planned it put it all together. It, it worked out and I think the funny thing is Nora, you know, I have only been to follow spin. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1732.96s)]
*  At that point, five times in my life. Right. And three of them were from when I was little. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1748.96s)]
*  And at that point the last time I had been was in 2013 and the time before that was the second and default. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1759.96s)]
*  When I was there on the ground as a child. And so, when we went in 2018. I have a really good memory, and I really had the responsibility of kind of directing us. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1767.96s)]
*  It's interesting how much I remembered, and I think people were like oh how many times you know so you've been here a lot and like guys I grew up in exile like I'm born in Oakland, California, like, like, you know, a lonely territory like I'm, I've been [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1783.96s)]
*  an excellent my whole life and there's a reason I've had to go back by myself. You know, because I'm, I'm in my immediate family I'm one of the only ones who can go back. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1797.96s)]
*  And that's always contingent as you know based on the Israeli military authority. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1805.96s)]
*  And so, what it was like for me, and for the other Palestinians from the Palestinian youth movement who were also delegates on the on the trip. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1811.96s)]
*  It was extremely powerful. That delegation has stuck with us, and it will continue to inform our existence for the rest of our lives. And what it also did was it helped us as the Palestinian youth movement, figure out and try to build out an infrastructure [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1822.96s)]
*  that looks like to actually engage in principled and transformative joint struggle. And so that's what that's what has has happened. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1838.96s)]
*  Trying to really delve into these things and I think it was lastly really transformative for Palestinians on the ground to meet indigenous peoples from Turtle Island in the kingdom of Hawaii. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1851.96s)]
*  I'll tell you that is one of my favorite stories from the delegation where we were in the Hisha refugee camp. And we were walking right and this mob of kids came and they were like so excited right they're like all sizes all ages and they're just talking with [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1864.96s)]
*  us like that. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1879.96s)]
*  And I'm trying to translate like we're all trying to translate from such asking all these questions. And this boy. I think he was like 14. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1881.96s)]
*  And he was like, I know you guys. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1889.96s)]
*  And I was like, what do you mean you know these guys like I know you guys. He's like this is what happened, and he started just listing off history, mostly about the Lakota struggle, actually, he just started going off he's like and on the planes, this is what happened [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1894.96s)]
*  and he's like, I know you guys. He's like, I know you guys. He's like, I know you guys. He's like, I know you guys. He's like, I know you guys. He's like, I know you guys. He's like, I know you guys. He's like, I know you guys. He's like, I know you guys. He's like, I know you guys. He's like, I know you guys. He's like, I know you guys. He's like, I know you guys. He's like, I know you guys. He's like, I know you guys. He's like, I know you guys. He's like, I know you guys. He's like, I know you guys. He's like, I know you guys. He's like, I know you guys. He's like, I know you guys. He's like, I know you guys. He's like, I know you guys. He's like, I know you guys. He's like, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1908.96s)]
*  I know you guys. He's like, I know you guys. He's like, I know you guys. And so I think that's another power is being able to actually fight for something and for something that most people think is already lost, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1938.96s)]
*  for something that most people think is already lost. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1950.96s)]
*  Land back. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1955.96s)]
*  Well, just give it up because it's [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1957.28s)]
*  a struggle that's already been lost. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1959.2s)]
*  Or a Fullerstein, freeing Palestine from the river [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1960.96s)]
*  to the sea, full return of every Palestinian to the land, [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1963.48s)]
*  and the full return of the land to every Palestinian. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1967.2s)]
*  It's lost. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1970.96s)]
*  Give it up. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1971.6000000000001s)]
*  But what we can see, actually, is [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1972.3600000000001s)]
*  that land back is happening more and more every day. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1975.5s)]
*  There are more cases of land back every single month. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1977.88s)]
*  And so we come from land back organizers. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1982.2800000000002s)]
*  Land back is as old as our people have been resisting [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1986.88s)]
*  from the time the first settlers stepped on our lands. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1990.24s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1992.68s)]
*  And so we know that the right of return, [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1993.88s)]
*  regardless of the fragmentation, regardless of the difficulties [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1995.44s)]
*  that we have in the Palestinian movement, [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=1998.44s)]
*  as does any community, we know that the right of return [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2000.0800000000002s)]
*  is a central demand. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2003.8000000000002s)]
*  And the right for full return and full liberation [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2005.0s)]
*  is a central demand that we will never give up for anybody. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2007.08s)]
*  No matter what, it is not negotiable, [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2011.4399999999998s)]
*  just as the Black Hills are not for sale. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2014.04s)]
*  And they will never be for sale. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2017.36s)]
*  Because it's the center. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2020.28s)]
*  The land convenes who we are. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2021.3999999999999s)]
*  And in all honesty, Palestine is a political struggle. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2023.08s)]
*  Our struggle is for political rights, [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2028.9199999999998s)]
*  not just our human rights. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2031.1999999999998s)]
*  But the struggle is deeply connected to the land. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2032.84s)]
*  We're not fighting for Palestine to exist in the sky. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2036.24s)]
*  We're not fighting for us to be able to exist as a shattered [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2038.92s)]
*  people across the world, living for generations in refugee camps, [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2041.8s)]
*  living for generations in exile with the hope [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2046.16s)]
*  that we get absorbed and some settler colonial nation [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2048.2s)]
*  to become American. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2051.16s)]
*  We're fighting for our dignity and for the full return of ourselves [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2052.8s)]
*  to ourselves. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2057.08s)]
*  That's what we're fighting for. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2057.88s)]
*  And so just to say, I think the Indigenous youth delegation [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2060.04s)]
*  was extremely powerful. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2063.84s)]
*  Because every single delegate who came felt like they were home [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2065.52s)]
*  and felt like they were welcomed and felt like they knew something [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2072.44s)]
*  intimately already that they were bringing in there. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2077.52s)]
*  So the last thing I'll say is, Jakub Odeh, [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2080.8s)]
*  elder and a leader from the village of Lifta, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2087.04s)]
*  he looked at Malia Hulaman at the end of our tour with him. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2090.72s)]
*  And he said, don't worry. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2096.8799999999997s)]
*  Don't worry. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2099.16s)]
*  And don't give up. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2101.0s)]
*  The land will come back. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2102.7599999999998s)]
*  It's already on its way. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2104.0s)]
*  Don't worry about them. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2105.3199999999997s)]
*  And he's 90-something years old. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2107.48s)]
*  And he's still fighting. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2109.12s)]
*  He's still fighting. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2111.0s)]
*  So we just also uplift our elders, [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2111.8799999999997s)]
*  like Jakub Odeh, Madonna Thunderhawk, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2114.7599999999998s)]
*  who have been fighting and have been teaching us [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2116.9199999999996s)]
*  what it means to hold these slogans and to hold these movements [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2119.4s)]
*  and to let nobody compromise their principles. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2123.52s)]
*  It's beautiful. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2128.0s)]
*  Thank you, Nadia. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2128.76s)]
*  Demetrius, I could see you're getting a little emotional [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2130.8s)]
*  about Nadia talking about what happened in Deheisha. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2135.76s)]
*  Can you tell us a couple of other moments of that trip [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2141.04s)]
*  and how it has helped inform and catalyze the work [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2145.48s)]
*  that you and Crystal are doing? [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2151.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2157.68s)]
*  I don't know, just that specific part about that kid. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2159.52s)]
*  Well, first of all, I used to be a football coach [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2164.76s)]
*  before even I got politicized. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2166.8s)]
*  I just always loved sports. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2170.16s)]
*  I always loved working with the kids. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2171.36s)]
*  I wanted to be a teacher. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2173.0s)]
*  But I don't know, just something about this kid telling me [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2176.36s)]
*  this history I had to learn throughout college. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2181.6s)]
*  Because they don't teach it in high school or middle school [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2184.0s)]
*  or whatever. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2186.4s)]
*  I had to learn this in college. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2186.88s)]
*  And he's a little guy. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2189.2400000000002s)]
*  Nadia says he's 14, but I was like, he's like 11. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2192.88s)]
*  He's like 10. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2195.6s)]
*  He's a baby. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2197.28s)]
*  But he's just telling me all this history and the fact [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2198.04s)]
*  that he's like, yeah, but I've never left this place. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2201.6s)]
*  I know about you guys. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2203.7599999999998s)]
*  Oh, man. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2206.68s)]
*  Yeah, that's like our connection. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2208.36s)]
*  Someone who me, I've never left the Southwest. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2213.04s)]
*  We lived in either in Arizona or in New Mexico. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2217.04s)]
*  And so just hearing that, I was just like, man, [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2220.4s)]
*  there's something there. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2225.84s)]
*  I just think of my little cousins, too. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2227.12s)]
*  I think of my nephews, my nieces. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2228.68s)]
*  They're the same way. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2230.88s)]
*  They also really never left their communities. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2232.04s)]
*  But man, oh, my gosh. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2236.2000000000003s)]
*  It was so much. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2239.28s)]
*  Every time me and Nadia get together, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2241.56s)]
*  we just always reminisce, too. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2243.48s)]
*  Just that delegation was really just something else. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2245.1200000000003s)]
*  I think one of my favorite parts was obviously the food. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2250.04s)]
*  Oh, my gosh, the food. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2252.36s)]
*  So we go to the tier. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2253.28s)]
*  Oh, my gosh. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2257.96s)]
*  So the peters, the place, they just have gardens, [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2260.28s)]
*  just gardens and gardens and just vegetables and crops. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2265.6800000000003s)]
*  And they're just growing food everywhere. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2268.7200000000003s)]
*  But there's this little restaurant. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2271.48s)]
*  After we get this whole tour of this beautiful place [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2275.32s)]
*  and talking about, oh, this is actually the place they just [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2277.76s)]
*  could not capture because it was just so strategic. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2282.4s)]
*  But they were really smart. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2284.76s)]
*  They were really smart. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2287.36s)]
*  And they were very clever. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2288.48s)]
*  They made themselves bigger than what they actually were. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2290.8s)]
*  They just had lights in all these houses. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2295.96s)]
*  They had clothes just hanging around. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2298.68s)]
*  They just like, oh, there's a whole ass army here. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2301.16s)]
*  Let's not mess with these guys. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2303.6s)]
*  And it worked. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2305.72s)]
*  There were 11 people holding it down. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2307.52s)]
*  And he said they didn't even wear the clothes. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2309.76s)]
*  They just kept washing them and putting them on the line. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2311.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2316.32s)]
*  I've never seen a more beautiful garden in my life. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2317.96s)]
*  I've never tasted it. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2320.04s)]
*  I mean, OK, so confession, I don't like vegetables. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2321.08s)]
*  But Palestinian vegetables, I was eating tomatoes. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2324.64s)]
*  I was eating cucumbers. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2330.52s)]
*  I was eating everything they were throwing at me [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2331.6s)]
*  because I never had anything more delicious in my life. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2333.92s)]
*  But I'm telling you, so anyways, the tier, at the end, [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2336.8s)]
*  we're walking through the villages. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2340.32s)]
*  We're walking through the gardens. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2341.88s)]
*  We're going up and down everywhere. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2343.56s)]
*  We're exploring this whole place. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2345.56s)]
*  And then there's this little restaurant. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2348.24s)]
*  And I don't know. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2351.96s)]
*  They just have bottles of bottles of just drinks. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2353.12s)]
*  OK, cool. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2357.2s)]
*  You bring out this huge, giant pan. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2359.64s)]
*  And it has, I don't know, eight chickens, [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2364.4s)]
*  eight whole chickens on it. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2367.4s)]
*  And there's two of these things. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2369.64s)]
*  It was like 16 chickens. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2371.2799999999997s)]
*  And it's just laid on a bed of just rice and some sort of sauce, [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2373.8s)]
*  like some vegetables in there. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2379.44s)]
*  But then they also have little plates all around the table. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2380.76s)]
*  And I was just like, there's only eight of us or 10 of us. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2383.5200000000004s)]
*  I was doing my part. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2389.5200000000004s)]
*  I was carrying the team on my back. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2390.7200000000003s)]
*  I ate two chickens. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2393.32s)]
*  I was eating half that rice. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2395.0400000000004s)]
*  But my goodness, the food. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2396.76s)]
*  But that also just goes into the hospitality [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2402.36s)]
*  of Indigenous people. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2405.1600000000003s)]
*  Everywhere I went, and me being like a resident [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2407.08s)]
*  within so-called Albuquerque, which is Tiwa territories, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2411.8s)]
*  the Pueblo people there, they have feast days. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2414.6800000000003s)]
*  There's a day where they open up their homes, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2417.8s)]
*  open the communities to everyone, people that they know. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2419.76s)]
*  And they invite people in. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2422.8s)]
*  And it's literally the same thing. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2423.88s)]
*  They feed everyone that comes. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2425.88s)]
*  They show them around the community. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2428.04s)]
*  They show them the dances, the prayers. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2429.6s)]
*  And everyone eats together. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2432.72s)]
*  And that's just the whole day of just welcoming you to our space [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2435.24s)]
*  and just having that relationship, [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2439.88s)]
*  just being good relatives, really. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2445.04s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2449.4s)]
*  That part really stuck with me. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2452.0s)]
*  But there was also one other part. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2454.52s)]
*  And I'll end it there. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2456.3199999999997s)]
*  But oh, gosh. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2458.88s)]
*  It was, I always feel bad. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2461.0s)]
*  Now, I always have to ask you. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2463.2000000000003s)]
*  But it's the place with the school. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2464.4s)]
*  Yeah, it was a knockup, right, when [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2466.2000000000003s)]
*  we went near an adequate medicine processing plant [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2468.52s)]
*  to their village. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2474.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, it was the Bedouin village. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2475.32s)]
*  And just talking to them and going to the school. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2480.08s)]
*  And this school has been demolished, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2483.48s)]
*  I don't know how many times. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2485.08s)]
*  But they keep rebuilding it. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2486.32s)]
*  And just them wanting to have education, [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2488.72s)]
*  or just fighting to educate themselves, even though he. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2494.24s)]
*  Oh, this was Khan al-Ahmar, actually, with the school. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2498.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, we went to Khan al-Ahmar during the camp, [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2501.8799999999997s)]
*  during the resistance. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2504.48s)]
*  And the upkeep, sorry. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2506.48s)]
*  We went a lot of places. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2508.0s)]
*  And then we went there. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2509.12s)]
*  And just going around. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2511.7599999999998s)]
*  And I was like, I don't know. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2513.2s)]
*  The infrastructures are just the way [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2515.88s)]
*  people are just so resilient. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2519.0800000000004s)]
*  Or they just make do with what they have. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2521.6000000000004s)]
*  And there's places that look like my grandma's house. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2524.5600000000004s)]
*  I mean, people will call it a shack or just a rundown home. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2527.32s)]
*  But it's not. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2530.7200000000003s)]
*  It's a home. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2531.6000000000004s)]
*  Even though it was put together with plywood or tarp or whatever, [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2533.44s)]
*  those are the same upbringing I agree with. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2537.6400000000003s)]
*  That's my grandma's house. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2541.8s)]
*  And we don't think it's rundown. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2544.32s)]
*  It's actually well-kept. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2545.76s)]
*  It's a place. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2548.0s)]
*  It's our home. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2548.6000000000004s)]
*  It's where my belly button's buried. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2549.32s)]
*  It's home. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2552.5600000000004s)]
*  But also, there's this in the middle of the village. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2554.0400000000004s)]
*  It's just like the sheep and the goats. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2557.44s)]
*  And they're just in there. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2561.44s)]
*  They're just doing their thing. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2562.76s)]
*  But it's like the sheep careal and the goats. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2564.0400000000004s)]
*  It just looks exactly the same. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2566.88s)]
*  Just like little barbed wire. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2570.2000000000003s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2572.2000000000003s)]
*  Little pieces of scrap wood just to create a careal. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2574.72s)]
*  But I don't know. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2578.8799999999997s)]
*  All my Danette homies will get it, all the people that have sheep. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2582.3999999999996s)]
*  But on the sheep careal, right there, [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2585.9199999999996s)]
*  around the top corner of the sheep careal, is a Wi-Fi router. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2589.64s)]
*  And I was just like, we're out here. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2595.7599999999998s)]
*  Got to have internet. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2600.7599999999998s)]
*  We ain't got internet. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2604.28s)]
*  We probably get electricity, just being honest. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2605.4s)]
*  But y'all got Wi-Fi? [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2608.6800000000003s)]
*  Like, man. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2609.96s)]
*  Yeah, these sheep out here watching Netflix. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2612.4s)]
*  I love it. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2618.2400000000002s)]
*  I love it. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2619.2000000000003s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2620.2400000000002s)]
*  Those are the things I held onto the most. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2620.76s)]
*  It is home. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2624.7200000000003s)]
*  And it is rowdy. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2625.5600000000004s)]
*  And it is kind of just like, I don't know what the word is. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2627.6000000000004s)]
*  It can be overwhelming. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2633.72s)]
*  But also, it's just the people that make it feel like home. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2635.4399999999996s)]
*  It's the people that bring everything together. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2638.12s)]
*  And that's exactly what it is back in Ganado. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2641.6s)]
*  People say, it's out in the middle of nowhere. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2644.64s)]
*  There's nothing really out there. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2646.72s)]
*  But it's the people, it's your relatives, [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2648.16s)]
*  it's the family that really make it a really, really special place. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2649.7999999999997s)]
*  But yeah. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2655.7999999999997s)]
*  That's beautiful. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2657.0s)]
*  And our executive director's father's family is from Batyr. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2658.64s)]
*  And his mother's from Lifta. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2662.88s)]
*  So I know that he'll be happy to hear your experiences [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2664.88s)]
*  in those places. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2670.6s)]
*  Crystal, what have been some of the reactions and also [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2675.2s)]
*  calls to action in ways that Indigenous folks are already [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2683.8s)]
*  using the position paper? [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2692.1200000000003s)]
*  And what are the next steps in meeting these demands [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2694.7200000000003s)]
*  that you've all laid out? [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2700.8s)]
*  Oh, man. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2704.0400000000004s)]
*  So reactions were definitely overall from Indigenous communities. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2705.1200000000003s)]
*  We're supportive. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2713.64s)]
*  I mean, and I think people, even some of the responses [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2715.04s)]
*  that we had conversations with folks, [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2718.24s)]
*  and we're like, we need to prepare you for backlash. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2720.08s)]
*  And we were very aware of that from the start. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2724.4s)]
*  And so we were really protective of our whole organization [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2726.8799999999997s)]
*  and did a lot of groundwork and prepping ourselves [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2729.8799999999997s)]
*  and bracing people for it, all of that. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2732.7999999999997s)]
*  And then we would have conversations [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2736.72s)]
*  with folks who we thought we really [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2738.3199999999997s)]
*  needed to support and bring along. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2740.52s)]
*  And they were like, well, of course. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2743.0s)]
*  They were just like, yeah, it makes sense. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2746.16s)]
*  That's the natural thing. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2748.4s)]
*  And I think for the most part, that has been the response, [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2751.88s)]
*  is that needed folks here are just like, well, yeah, [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2754.84s)]
*  that's what we went through. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2759.2s)]
*  And then when you lay out the history and the parallels [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2760.44s)]
*  that exist, they're like, yeah, that just makes sense. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2762.84s)]
*  And so I think that overall has been the response. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2766.48s)]
*  I also think we're treading, I don't [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2769.56s)]
*  know if it's necessarily new territory, [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2775.64s)]
*  but I think we're moving into a space and a path that [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2779.2799999999997s)]
*  has been less traveled around indigeneity [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2785.3599999999997s)]
*  in acknowledging Palestinian peoples as Indigenous [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2788.16s)]
*  siblings to us. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2791.04s)]
*  And I think that we're moving into that space. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2792.7599999999998s)]
*  We're moving into that space, and we say who our relatives are. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2795.08s)]
*  We don't wait for the state to say who we are [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2800.88s)]
*  and who we're connected to and who we're related to. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2803.7599999999998s)]
*  We don't wait for the state to say who is who [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2807.04s)]
*  and what our identities are. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2809.6s)]
*  We define that. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2811.24s)]
*  And so I think that is a big thing that we're stepping into [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2813.72s)]
*  and that we're pushing. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2819.12s)]
*  And we're not standing down from that. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2822.24s)]
*  Our organization has stepped into many coalitions [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2825.44s)]
*  and spaces where we are actively supporting [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2827.92s)]
*  and calling for different organizations to not take trips [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2830.52s)]
*  to apartheid states. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2834.72s)]
*  We're calling for the defunding of different spaces [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2836.6s)]
*  that fund these things. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2839.96s)]
*  And the ironic thing is that we didn't [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2842.64s)]
*  receive the amount of Zionist backlash [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2848.36s)]
*  that we thought we would. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2851.04s)]
*  And I think it's because we're a different kind of group. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2853.16s)]
*  It's a very different thing right now. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2858.3999999999996s)]
*  And so we're sitting with all of that. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2861.16s)]
*  We're exploring it. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2863.2s)]
*  And in terms of next steps, we're [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2864.04s)]
*  continuing to go and to find ways [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2866.92s)]
*  to put the paper into action. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2868.6s)]
*  I think we're still in that after period of interviews [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2871.08s)]
*  and conversation and really diving into that. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2875.44s)]
*  But our organization is already making [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2878.92s)]
*  some pretty large commitments. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2881.12s)]
*  I can't name a whole lot of things publicly, [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2883.92s)]
*  but we have some pretty big commitments [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2886.4s)]
*  that are rolling out soon. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2888.44s)]
*  And so we're here. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2890.52s)]
*  We're not backing down. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2894.0s)]
*  We're not going anywhere. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2895.2799999999997s)]
*  And we're committed to this work. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2897.88s)]
*  And we see each other that way. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2900.8399999999997s)]
*  And so I think that, yeah, there's big next steps. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2902.56s)]
*  And there's some smaller steps in terms [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2906.56s)]
*  of building with each other, being in coalition [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2909.12s)]
*  with each other, having some tangible calls to actions, [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2912.4s)]
*  things like that. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2915.0s)]
*  And we're doing the legwork of meeting that together. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2915.92s)]
*  And I think as we go deeper, we will even [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2919.68s)]
*  explore what are the various different tactics [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2922.4s)]
*  and strategies around reclaiming land, and how does that look, [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2927.88s)]
*  and what does that look like in the international movement [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2931.44s)]
*  space. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2935.2799999999997s)]
*  And so we're in those conversations. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2936.4s)]
*  We're still exploring all of that. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2938.48s)]
*  We're seeing, trying to take our experience and knowledge [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2939.92s)]
*  and see how it applies, what doesn't work, what does work. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2943.52s)]
*  Yeah, so I'd say that's kind of where we are right now. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2947.76s)]
*  And we're not going anywhere. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2950.0s)]
*  I think that as we went on with this process, [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2952.48s)]
*  our organization and individuals in our organization, [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2956.04s)]
*  we're about 60 people in our organization [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2958.72s)]
*  who are politicized at varying different degrees. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2962.2400000000002s)]
*  But I will say that the impact that doing this paper has [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2966.72s)]
*  left with each individual in our organization [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2970.3199999999997s)]
*  has been powerful. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2972.52s)]
*  And I see a level of commitment from folks [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2974.12s)]
*  I did not expect it from. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2977.64s)]
*  And I see them really stepping into this work too, [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2979.48s)]
*  and feeling, not just knowing strategically, [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2984.08s)]
*  tactically this makes sense. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2988.2799999999997s)]
*  But they feel it. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2989.9199999999996s)]
*  And they're moving with that. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2991.8799999999997s)]
*  And so yeah, I would say there's a lot of work [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2993.12s)]
*  to be done still. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2996.44s)]
*  But we're not going anywhere. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2998.4s)]
*  We're here for it. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=2999.8s)]
*  That's phenomenal. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=3001.2000000000003s)]
*  And where can people, we're going to put the link up, [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=3002.7200000000003s)]
*  obviously, on the post that accompanies this episode. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=3005.92s)]
*  But if people want to learn more about the Indian Collective, [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgY-ZzZ7KuY&t=3010.2400000000002s)]
