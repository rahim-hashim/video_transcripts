# How a California city stopped corporate complicity in Israel's crimes
**The Electronic Intifada:** [March 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw)
*  Hello and welcome back to the Electronic Into Thought podcast. I'm Nora Barrows-Freedman. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=0.0s)]
*  In January, the city of Hayward, California passed a resolution to divest $1.6 million [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=4.88s)]
*  in investments from four corporations that do business with the Israeli occupation, Caterpillar, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=10.96s)]
*  Chevron, Hyundai, and Intel. Joining us to talk about how they did it and why it's a [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=16.84s)]
*  significant victory for the global boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement are several [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=21.8s)]
*  activists involved with the campaign in Hayward. Alexis Villalobos and George Sirup co-founded [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=26.5s)]
*  the Hayward Community Coalition in 2020 to organize in response to the murder of George [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=32.980000000000004s)]
*  Floyd and to prevent school closures and improve tenant protections in their hometown. Alexis [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=39.18s)]
*  is also a labor and community organizer, and George was elected to the Hayward City Council [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=45.379999999999995s)]
*  in 2022, where he continues to fight against displacement as the council's only renter. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=50.5s)]
*  And Nome Perry is the strategic research coordinator of the American Friends Service [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=56.66s)]
*  Committee's Action Center for Corporate Accountability. He coordinates the Investigate [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=61.86s)]
*  Project, researching corporate complicity in state violence and human rights violations, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=66.82s)]
*  including the U.S. prison, border, and surveillance industries, as well as military occupation and [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=71.66s)]
*  apartheid in Palestine. Thank you all for being with us today on the Electronic and Defata podcast. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=77.74s)]
*  Thanks for having me. So let's start by laying out why Hayward activists chose to pressure the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=82.69999999999999s)]
*  city council into divestment, which is a material consequence of Israel's apartheid and occupation, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=91.3s)]
*  especially during this genocide in Gaza and especially at a time when other city councils [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=97.41999999999999s)]
*  are having a hard time passing even very watered down or symbolic resolutions for a ceasefire. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=103.42s)]
*  Alexis, do you want to begin? Sure. Well, I think it goes back to our founding in 2020. We got [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=109.82000000000001s)]
*  organized in the, like you said, in response to the murder of George Floyd. And a lot of the thinking [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=116.94s)]
*  behind starting Haycock over the Hayward Community Coalition was that we saw in Hayward, which is [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=122.34s)]
*  an otherwise very politically sleepy town, there's not a lot of political activism going on Hayward. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=127.46000000000001s)]
*  We saw a lot of very angry, a lot of very active people, the community becoming activated, going to [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=132.01999999999998s)]
*  rallies, showing up, marching in the streets. And we knew that we had to organize the energy and [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=137.66s)]
*  let it fizzle out. And so we organized the energy around what solutions people wanted back then. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=142.66s)]
*  And solutions kept pointing towards having direct control over the funding. Where is the money, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=148.06s)]
*  like following the money, how money is being spent in the police system in Hayward, how money is [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=153.17999999999998s)]
*  being not allocated to community services and focusing on that. And we got really good at that. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=159.34s)]
*  We got good at moving hundreds of thousands of dollars over the years to make sure that we are [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=163.26s)]
*  divesting in a sense from over policing of our communities and investing in community solutions. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=167.54s)]
*  And so when we saw this happening, so after October 7th, and we saw the horrible bombing and the siege [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=173.62s)]
*  on Gaza starting, we were thinking, what can we do? What are we able to do in this moment? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=183.02s)]
*  This very large global issue that goes far beyond the city of Hayward. Well, we knew that we were [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=189.7s)]
*  really good at moving money around. So we thought, how do we follow the money here in Hayward? What [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=197.02s)]
*  can we do here in Hayward that would have a material impact? And by doing some research, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=201.26s)]
*  we saw that in 1985, the city of Hayward divested from companies that were complicit in the apartheid [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=205.18s)]
*  of South Africa. We saw that there was precedent to do this. And we said, you know what? This is [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=210.5s)]
*  where we're going to go. We looked at the BDS website to figure out which targets we would need [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=214.7s)]
*  to look at. We found which companies were on the BDS list, looked them up in our investment [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=219.2s)]
*  portfolio, which George will have a better time explaining how all that works. And set our target [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=224.83999999999997s)]
*  on those companies and decided we're going to organize the community to move that money. And [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=231.79999999999998s)]
*  that's what we did. And yeah, George, as a member of the Hayward City Council, what access to that [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=236.64s)]
*  kind of portfolio investment information did you have? And why was it important for you as a member [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=244.16s)]
*  of the council to get this passed? Yeah, thanks for that question. So I'll start by saying the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=251.52s)]
*  city of Hayward does a great job with making its information publicly available. So it's actually [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=258.44s)]
*  quite difficult to find investment portfolios for cities across the country. But Hayward put forward [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=262.84s)]
*  its list of companies in a pretty straightforward manner on its website. I also serve on the city's [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=267.56s)]
*  budget and finance committee. And so I was aware that the total amount we had invested was about [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=272.24s)]
*  $250 million. And the companies we were looking at on the BDS list only totaled about $1.6 million [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=276.8s)]
*  of that total investment portfolio. And so, you know, I really struggled to put a ceasefire [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  resolution on the table because we were limited as a council because of a resolution passed in 77 [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=288.84000000000003s)]
*  saying we can't comment on issues that don't affect the direct administration of the city or fall [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=295.48s)]
*  within our jurisdiction. And, you know, I think that's a little bit subjective. I think that our tax dollars [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=301.16s)]
*  do affect our administration. And if our tax dollars are funding a genocide, that's a problem that [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=305.64s)]
*  involves me and my residents, especially when our schools are closing and our hospitals are facing [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=309.68s)]
*  financial collapse. I mean, you know, I said in my divestment speech that every bomb dropped could be a [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=314.8s)]
*  teacher salary. So I digress, but I was still limited by that policy from 77. So instead, that's why we [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=319.72s)]
*  pivoted towards a divestment policy instead, because this did impact our direct administration. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=326.92s)]
*  This was within our jurisdiction. And beyond just being a member of the council, I'm still a member [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=331.36s)]
*  of the Hayward community. And beyond the fiscal arguments, we had several Palestinian residents, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=336.16s)]
*  neighbors and their friends coming out saying that it is unconscionable for us to be directly funding [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=340.88s)]
*  the genocide of their own family members. And rather than say, you know, ceasefire, which we've seen [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=346.6s)]
*  several cities do, and we tried to do in Hayward, which fell on deaf ears, we were tired of begging [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=351.44s)]
*  and saying, you know, what power do we actually have to not be complicit and make a material [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=357.12s)]
*  difference and a material change right now, and hopefully inspire other agencies and other [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=361.28s)]
*  organizations and institutions to do the same. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=366.0s)]
*  Can you talk a little bit more about your constituency and how involved the community was in [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=369.92s)]
*  getting this passed? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=378.24s)]
*  Yeah, this wouldn't have passed without the community. The constituency of Hayward is very [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=380.0s)]
*  working class. And I would also say a little politically disorganized, similar to what Alexis [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=385.28s)]
*  said, you know, we are a politically sleepy town. But one of the goals of the Hayward Community [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=390.64s)]
*  Coalition is to develop and build that base. And so one of the reasons we felt we were successful [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=394.32s)]
*  in our divestment action is it wasn't just the self-selected activists that were coming out and [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=399.59999999999997s)]
*  yelling at the council. These were members of our community, not just members that we know, but [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=404.32s)]
*  members that other council members know, too. It's a lot harder to say no to an ask from the [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=408.88s)]
*  community when it's, you know, rather than an activist, somebody that you taught or someone [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=413.52s)]
*  that you went to school with or someone that you work with. And we really leverage those [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=418.24s)]
*  relationships to demonstrate that this isn't just a handful of radical lefties, but this is a [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=422.15999999999997s)]
*  strongly felt issue that's impacting people directly. And we want to see our city take [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=427.76s)]
*  material action. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=432.15999999999997s)]
*  And Alexis, can you talk a little bit about any pushback that you faced while trying to organize [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=432.96s)]
*  this and how you handled that? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=444.4s)]
*  I think in terms of the pushback, George covered a bit of the early pushback. I mean, we started [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=450.0s)]
*  making these demands in December. And so the pushback that we started getting was that [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=456.79999999999995s)]
*  that this would cause... I almost feel terrible repeating them because it was hard to hear this. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=461.36s)]
*  It felt like just like logical gymnastics. We got calls from former council members and city leaders [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=469.04s)]
*  saying that pushing for this was going to increase Islamophobia in our city, that it was going to [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=477.20000000000005s)]
*  increase anti-Semitism, and that for those it's going to hurt certain people's feelings. Those [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=481.76s)]
*  arguments and trying to really discourage us from making these pushes. And the way we handled that [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=488.88s)]
*  was by understanding the logic or at least the flawed logic in those arguments and explaining [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=495.84s)]
*  that to community members when we were organizing and asking them to stand up, that these are the [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=500.96s)]
*  arguments that are going to be made against you and against us, that we are hateful, that we are [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=504.32s)]
*  risking more hateful things to happen here. And just in a way preparing people to know that that's [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=508.56s)]
*  what's going to happen and we're going to need to stay steadfast in this fight and not let that [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=513.4399999999999s)]
*  distract us. And so that's how we handled it, is just understanding what those counterarguments [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=517.68s)]
*  are going to be and preparing the community for them and to know that they're coming. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=523.12s)]
*  The best defenses and offense. Yeah, exactly. Noam, I want to bring you in. Tell us about the [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=527.28s)]
*  significance of this $1.6 million divestiture from these four companies, which have been long-time [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=534.4799999999999s)]
*  targets of the Boy Cat Divestment Sanctions Movement. Tell us about how Caterpillar, Chevron, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=541.04s)]
*  Hyundai, and Intel help Israel reinforce its illegal occupation and apartheid system and how [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=547.04s)]
*  those companies are assisting in the genocide of Gaza right now. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=554.0s)]
*  Yeah, thank you for that question. You know, these four companies do different things in [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=558.7199999999999s)]
*  Palestine, as you probably know. Intel is the largest private employer in Israel, even though [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=564.24s)]
*  it's a U.S. company. It doesn't have any direct relationship or business operations in the [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=571.68s)]
*  occupied Palestinian territories, as far as we know, but it's still a major player in Israeli [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=579.76s)]
*  economy. Hyundai, of course, makes heavy machinery that Israel uses to demolish Palestinian homes as [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=584.4799999999999s)]
*  collective punishment all over the West Bank, as well as Caterpillar. Caterpillar has a more [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=591.52s)]
*  intense involvement because it weaponizes its bulldozers for Israel, those famous D9 bulldozers. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=597.12s)]
*  Right now, we see Caterpillar bulldozers in Gaza working alongside Israeli battle tanks, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=608.72s)]
*  flattening entire Palestinian residential neighborhoods. I don't know if you saw, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=615.12s)]
*  there's a new so-called highway that Israeli is building in the middle of the Gaza Strip, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=620.24s)]
*  dissecting it to north and south, so Caterpillar equipment is central to doing that kind of [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=628.4s)]
*  engineering work. The fourth company, Chevron, of course, is a major player in the Israeli [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=633.92s)]
*  energy sector. It operates and partially owns two major gas fields in the eastern [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=639.28s)]
*  Mediterranean off the shores, off the coast of Israel. This is gas, natural gas, that should [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=645.68s)]
*  belong to the Palestinian people, and instead it flows into Israel, powers Israeli cities, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=651.92s)]
*  including illegal settlements in the West Bank, powers military bases all over Israel. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=661.8399999999999s)]
*  I think I know that the gas that is provided by Chevron to the Israeli electrical company, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=668.24s)]
*  which is the government supplier, forms about 98% of the gas that it uses. So it's a major player, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=676.4s)]
*  it's involved in potentially pillage, and the BDS movement actually just launched a boycott campaign [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=688.16s)]
*  against Chevron that my organization is proud to be part of, specifically because of these activities. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=696.72s)]
*  We're calling Chevron to end its complicity in Israeli apartheid. Now the significance of this [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=702.96s)]
*  divestment, first of all, the things that Hayward was invested in is bonds, right? Bonds are [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=708.1600000000001s)]
*  essentially loans that we give to companies and then we get returns on. And I think there's a [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=718.48s)]
*  question that we should be asking ourselves, which companies do we want to give loans to? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=726.08s)]
*  When we give loans to a company, that means that we enable it to do further business. That's the [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=732.88s)]
*  essential relationship of the bond. And so we need to ask ourselves if those things that the company [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=738.96s)]
*  does are things that we want to endorse and we want to finance. I don't think there's an immediate [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=746.0s)]
*  financial implication. These are not astronomical funds of money. Hayward is a small city. This is [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=753.44s)]
*  not a major investment. So I don't think there will be expected to be any financial [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=760.5600000000001s)]
*  implication immediately on these four companies. But the symbolic effect is huge. And I think [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=766.24s)]
*  this hurts the company's reputation. This potentially could harm their ability to [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=772.5600000000001s)]
*  borrow more money from other institutional lenders and this harms overall their reputation [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=779.04s)]
*  and their ability to have social capital to continue doing their business around the world. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=784.88s)]
*  The major significance here is that Hayward, as far as I know, is the first city that has done [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=792.8s)]
*  this thing. And I know because we tried for many years to have cities take action against certain [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=797.04s)]
*  corporations through their investment in other ways. And we haven't been successful so far until [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=804.72s)]
*  Hayward. And on the one hand, I'm very proud. On the other hand, I'm kind of dismayed that this is [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=810.96s)]
*  what it took. It takes a genocide, apparently, for cities to start paying attention. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=816.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And here in the Bay Area, Hayward is in the Bay Area, for those who don't know. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=824.4s)]
*  There have been sustained protests against Chevron. There was a major shareholders meeting, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=831.04s)]
*  I think last month in February, where people were protesting people coming out of some big [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=837.12s)]
*  event. And then there was also a major protest at the Chevron refinery in Richmond. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=844.9599999999999s)]
*  Does this victory against these four companies, including Chevron, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=851.12s)]
*  has it inspired other activist organizations in other cities around California, but also around [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=858.4s)]
*  the state? Have you heard of any other city councils taking up this divestment action yet? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=866.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I'm so glad you asked. I don't know of city councils that are actually debating this right now. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=874.24s)]
*  There might be. I mean, there are thousands of cities in the United States. I know there are [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=879.52s)]
*  activists that have contacted me and trying to figure out, oh, wait, how did Hayward do this? [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=883.6s)]
*  And can we maybe replicate this? So I know I'm actively working with activists in several cities, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=888.64s)]
*  and I invite our viewers and listeners here, if you want help to strategize around the city [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=894.88s)]
*  divestment campaign, we're here to support you. We also work with students and faculty and [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=900.8000000000001s)]
*  other types of investors on that. But I want to take a step back and say something broader, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=911.2s)]
*  because you mentioned, Nora, in the beginning, the dozens of ceasefire resolutions that have [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=918.4s)]
*  passed in cities and other bodies around the country. And these are great. Of course, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=924.56s)]
*  we should all call for a ceasefire that's a no-brainer. And what Palestinian civil society [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=930.0s)]
*  has called on all of us to do almost 20 years ago now in 2005 is to do more than that, is to, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=936.2399999999999s)]
*  in a way, it's a much simpler ask. It's not to comment on something that's happening somewhere [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=945.4399999999999s)]
*  far away in another part of the world, which is what a call for a ceasefire does. But it's looking [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=950.24s)]
*  at our own complicity and relationships to what's happening over there. Like George said, some cities [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=955.84s)]
*  might be limited in how they can comment on things that are not affecting themselves, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=964.5600000000001s)]
*  but our money is our money. And we should have a say about where it goes. And that's exactly what [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=969.12s)]
*  the BDS call was asking us to do, to look at our relationships and how we might be involved in [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=974.48s)]
*  apartheid, in genocide, in military occupation in Palestine, and to use these ties to try to create [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=981.2s)]
*  change. So cities might have investments in some companies. By the way, Investigate is a website [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=989.12s)]
*  that you can look at to find a list of companies that you should divest from or your city should [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=997.84s)]
*  divest from. But cities can have other relationships, relationships with corporations, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1003.44s)]
*  right? Like procurement relationships or other types of contracts that cities might have with [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1010.8000000000001s)]
*  certain corporations that we want to pressure. I know a lot of cities in the United States have [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1017.2800000000001s)]
*  kind of sister city relationships with Israeli cities. So of course these are all symbolic, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1022.24s)]
*  but it means something. You know, it means something when we say, oh, we're a sister city of [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1028.4s)]
*  Ashkelon, for example, which is very close to the Gaza Strip. And what does it mean right now to be [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1033.8400000000001s)]
*  a sister city of a city in a country that engages in genocide? Some cities might be invested in [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1038.4s)]
*  Israel bonds, which of course directly funds the Israeli government. And so I think the starting [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1046.8s)]
*  point is to figure out those connections and what is possible. And each city is different. Each city [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1053.92s)]
*  is unique. It has its own politics. It has its own background. It has its own [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1058.72s)]
*  connections to Israeli apartheid. And one thing I can suggest to everyone, we have a platform called [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1063.52s)]
*  Apartheid Free Communities. It's apartheidfree.org. And it invites any institution. It can be a city. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1070.32s)]
*  It can be a student group. It can be a university. It can be a church or other faith organization. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1079.28s)]
*  It invites us to pledge to become apartheid free. And we're not exactly telling you how to do that. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1085.6000000000001s)]
*  You know, that's not our job. That's your job, right? So you can pledge to become apartheid free. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1093.6000000000001s)]
*  And then hopefully that inspires a process that helps you figure out, okay, where are my connections [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1098.56s)]
*  to apartheid? And how can I remove myself from that harmful situation? [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1106.24s)]
*  Thanks, Noam. Alexis and George, how important is it for you personally as activists in Hayward [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1112.24s)]
*  to do something, to affect change, to build and organize your community in defense of Palestinians [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1122.96s)]
*  in defense of Palestinians and against the US's complicity in this genocide? Alexis, let's start [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1136.8s)]
*  with you. I would say there's, I have two thoughts on this. I think one of them is that myself as an [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1144.48s)]
*  organizer and activist, like I see myself as a huge optimist and it's incredibly difficult to [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1156.48s)]
*  find optimism when you're seeing a genocide being live streamed. But it's a challenge at the same [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1162.48s)]
*  time to find out what can I do to make something happen here? And to be able to find that and to [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1167.68s)]
*  tackle it and to see some movement was incredibly important to me. And it's important to me to think [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1173.2s)]
*  of this as like, as Noam said, like to be very aware that the city of Hayward is small, but this [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1180.16s)]
*  could set off like a snowball effect. Like, hopefully it does. That's our biggest hope is that [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1187.1200000000001s)]
*  the work gets out, that we're out here spreading this word that this is possible. You can replicate [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1191.28s)]
*  this. You can be apartheid free and that collectively we can divest enough to really [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1194.8s)]
*  put that pressure on. That's what my fingers are crossed for. And we'll continue to work for. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1199.76s)]
*  My other thought is that, you know, we started this work being very clear-eyed that the response [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1205.44s)]
*  to the murder of George Floyd was not simply about, you know, punishing bad apples in the [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1213.76s)]
*  police department, but it was about the liberation of Black people in the United States. And to find [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1218.32s)]
*  that this, that movement and that fight and that struggle for liberation of people of color here [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1223.4399999999998s)]
*  in the U.S. is completely tied to the liberation of Palestinian people in Gaza, in the West Bank, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1229.28s)]
*  the connection between the militarized police state, the incarceration system, the profiteering [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1235.36s)]
*  of these systems, and how much of those issues are connected. This issue is incredibly important [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1241.52s)]
*  to me and to us as an organization. It's not really reaching. It is actually, it's related. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1249.92s)]
*  It is part of what we've been doing since 2020. And yeah, I think that's what I'll say. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1257.12s)]
*  Yeah, I think Alexis hit the nail on the head there. It was incredibly well put. I think [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1265.44s)]
*  speaking for myself, you know, I feel incredibly grateful for the role that I'm able to hold on the [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1270.4s)]
*  city council because of my community's belief in myself. And I find the work that I do there on a [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1275.8400000000001s)]
*  regular basis very meaningful. But this action in particular, you know, being raised in a system [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1280.5600000000002s)]
*  that seems so gargantuan and so difficult to move and so difficult to change and feeling [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1287.3600000000001s)]
*  like so much struggle is required to even move the needle just a little bit. Is it even possible [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1294.88s)]
*  to move the needle? When we were able to pull this off, I really felt like I was on the, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1300.32s)]
*  I was living in real time, one of the most meaningful days of my entire life when we, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1305.4399999999998s)]
*  as a community, got the council to narrowly approve this divestment in a four-three split vote. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1309.6799999999998s)]
*  And, you know, when I was a kid, I was in the streets of my parents protesting the Iraq war [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1315.12s)]
*  and U.S. imperialism. And, you know, I've been really dismayed to see the Democratic Party become [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1320.6399999999999s)]
*  a party of warmongers and buy into the military industrial complex. And I'll save my critiques [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1326.72s)]
*  for the Democratic Party another time because I have plenty of those. But what I will say is that, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1332.88s)]
*  you know, I was under the impression that the military industrial complex is a problem. And [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1337.76s)]
*  what this vote also represented to me was a moment for us collectively to put a dent in this machine [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1343.52s)]
*  and to show people what it takes to do that. And I've been elated at the amount of support [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1349.84s)]
*  from all over the country, organizers in St. Louis and on the East Coast, people within their [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1356.08s)]
*  unions trying to figure out how to divest their union dollars, students across California, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1360.8s)]
*  I think Riverside just divested their student union funds, I think Davis divested 16 million. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1365.04s)]
*  There are all these institutions that are starting to say, wait, we do have power. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1370.1599999999999s)]
*  We can do something. We don't just have to beg. We don't just have to be ignored. We can take [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1374.24s)]
*  matters into our own hand. And so seeing how other people are collectively raising their [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1378.8799999999999s)]
*  consciousness around material impact and building power to have a material impact [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1384.88s)]
*  really is invigorating for me. And to be able to do that in little Hayward feels like such a blessing. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1389.8400000000001s)]
*  So I'm just incredibly proud of all my co-organizers and the people that are [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1396.48s)]
*  heeding this call to action and really continuing to push this forward. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1403.2s)]
*  And if people do want to replicate this in their own communities, Alexis, what are some of the first steps? [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1408.72s)]
*  So I think some of the first steps is to start thinking about relationships you already have. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1422.48s)]
*  I think, George, when you were speaking, you reminded me of how good it felt to be able to do this, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1429.6799999999998s)]
*  not just in my work, but with people I grew up with. People I know, people who are students with me, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1434.0s)]
*  people who are my teachers, people who make pizza down the street at their local business, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1441.28s)]
*  they're out here doing this together. And so I guess what my point here is to start with the [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1447.12s)]
*  people you know, start with the relationships you have, and to start making an organization. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1452.1599999999999s)]
*  What that means when I say that is to make a commitment towards a goal, towards a target, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1459.68s)]
*  whether that is reforming the police in your city, whether that's getting more funding to [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1464.3200000000002s)]
*  your community services, whatever that might be, those common goals, like start by making sure that [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1470.8s)]
*  there is some sort of cohesion and some sort of collaboration going on in your city. And that way, [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1475.6000000000001s)]
*  when these issues come up, when you want to target these bigger issues, when you already have a base, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1481.1200000000001s)]
*  you already have people who you can rely on, who understand what it means to stick to a plan, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1485.36s)]
*  to make asks, to go and struggle together. So I would say, start with the relationships you have. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1490.1599999999999s)]
*  If you're already in an organization, like hey, Coco, I think in 2020, we didn't imagine this is [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1499.76s)]
*  what we would be doing in four years, but we didn't have to reinvent an entire new organization, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1504.32s)]
*  a new mission statement to be able to do this. Start with organizations that already exist. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1510.7199999999998s)]
*  So if you already have that in your community, think about what organizations, what structures [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1514.88s)]
*  already exist that you can leverage or turn attention to these issues. I think that I would [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1521.0400000000002s)]
*  start there with thinking about what relationships you already have, bringing them together if they're [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1525.7600000000002s)]
*  not already organized, and where they are already organized, redirecting the attention and the energy [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1531.7600000000002s)]
*  towards this issue. George, did you want to add to that? [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1537.2800000000002s)]
*  I think Alexis hit the, again, hit the nail on the head. He's a really talented organizer. I think [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1541.6s)]
*  there's also an element of research that's required. We found just through one of our [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1551.04s)]
*  members doing some investigation on their own, this 1985 resolution against apartheid South Africa, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1559.6799999999998s)]
*  and that precedent we felt was really valuable to see, hey, this has been done before. And the city [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1564.9599999999998s)]
*  of Hayward already has in its policy that we don't invest in nuclear weapons. And so that helped [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1569.52s)]
*  build the case. And then we tried to ask for a ceasefire in December and didn't get that, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1574.8s)]
*  but we also asked for a divestment at the same time, and we're able to come back in January and [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1581.28s)]
*  push for that. And so I say all of this because I think the narrative is really important too. As [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1585.12s)]
*  you're bringing folks together and you're pushing, you might not get what you want on the first ask, [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1589.36s)]
*  but I think how you show people that systems of power are ignoring you and how you show people [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1593.84s)]
*  that you're being told, no, we won't stop being complicit in the face of a genocide gets more [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1599.76s)]
*  people riled up, gets more people agitated. So in addition to building these structures, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1605.04s)]
*  really being mindful of what the narrative is as you're fighting for ultimately justice. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1609.1999999999998s)]
*  And before I forget, I really want to thank Nome and his team at the AFSC for the research that [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1615.6799999999998s)]
*  they did. I mean, if it wasn't for their prerequisite research, we wouldn't have known [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1621.28s)]
*  which companies to target in our divestment action. This is truly a collective effort that [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1625.2s)]
*  extends beyond the boundaries of Hayward, which is itself a territory on colonial land, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1629.68s)]
*  if we want to go there. And so I just want to encourage folks that it's important to bring [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1634.8s)]
*  folks together and do that work to make the most compelling argument. We were very specific about [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1641.12s)]
*  these companies, not just because of the BDS list, but because narratively the ask was so reasonable [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1645.6s)]
*  to divest less than 1% of our portfolio to not be complicit in genocide, especially when Hayward [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1650.8s)]
*  prides itself on being a green city and we have money parked in Chevron. It's what are we doing [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1657.9199999999998s)]
*  here? Why isn't anybody speaking up? Right? So narratively, how could you say no? I think really [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1662.08s)]
*  being mindful of that is important because beyond just the organizers and the community coming [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1667.36s)]
*  together to ask, there's also the court of public opinion. And when you're bringing together a [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1672.24s)]
*  coalition, you're trying to win over more folks in that court. So I just wanted to throw that out [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1676.24s)]
*  there too. Thanks for that. And Noam, again, tell us how AFSC and your investigate project [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1680.4s)]
*  can help replicate these kinds of actions elsewhere. Yeah, absolutely. So on investigate, [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1691.92s)]
*  investigate.info, we collect routinely information about companies that are involved specifically in [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1699.92s)]
*  the Israeli occupation. So specific human rights violations as part of the Israeli occupation, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1707.52s)]
*  like the bombings of Gaza, like home demolitions, like illegal settlements into West Bank. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1712.8s)]
*  And if folks have some insider information, like we have in Hayward, about the city's investments, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1718.0s)]
*  then we can intersect those lists and see, okay, which are the problematic companies that we want [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1726.8s)]
*  to target. But I want to say in a lot of cases, like George said earlier, this information is not [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1732.24s)]
*  available. A lot of cities and a lot of investors in general are very secretive and they don't have [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1737.76s)]
*  to disclose their investments. And so they don't. And that shouldn't hold us back because most cities [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1742.96s)]
*  in the United States, the vast majority, you know, by far, actually don't have any criteria, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1750.24s)]
*  any social criteria, anything that limits the investments from a social or human rights [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1757.28s)]
*  standpoint. So even if we don't know what the city is particularly invested in, getting a resolution [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1764.16s)]
*  that says, okay, the city will examine its own investments and report on them to the public [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1771.2s)]
*  and start a process to say, okay, we don't want to be invested in genocide and apartheid. Maybe we [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1778.64s)]
*  also don't want to be invested in other social harms, in tobacco, in weapons in general, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1784.32s)]
*  in fossil fuels, of course. So, you know, this is a process that can start at the city level [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1791.28s)]
*  to do something that, like George said, is very straightforward. Like, what do we want our money [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1797.2s)]
*  to support in the world? In a way, this is what BDS is all about. And, you know, BDS, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1804.24s)]
*  because of a long time, well organized state campaign by the state of Israel against it, [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1809.92s)]
*  became some kind of demon. You know, BDS is like seen as very radical and very [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1817.04s)]
*  almost violent to some people. But in a way, it's very straightforward. You know, we live in the [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1824.64s)]
*  United States, it's the belly of the beast in terms of support for Israel, you know, it sends [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1829.44s)]
*  more weapons to Israel right now than all the other countries combined and has been doing so [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1835.2s)]
*  for decades. Of course, also supports Israel in the diplomatic arena internationally. And so we [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1840.48s)]
*  already have taken sides, maybe not ourselves as individuals, but our system, the system that we [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1848.96s)]
*  live in has already taken a side. And so the only thing that BDS is asking us is actually to become [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1854.48s)]
*  neutral, to not support just one side of this bloody conflict, which is of course the main [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1860.56s)]
*  aggressor over the decades. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1867.36s)]
*  So it's investigate.info. And how can people get in touch with the American Friends Service Committee? [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1869.36s)]
*  So we have a website, of course, like all good organizations, afsc.org. And we have a website [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1875.36s)]
*  like all good organizations, afsc.org. And if you want to reach me specifically, you can go to [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1883.36s)]
*  investigate and hit the contact us button on investigate.info. And that will be an email that [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1892.7199999999998s)]
*  I see specifically if you want to if you want to work on divestment specifically from an investment [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1899.1999999999998s)]
*  portfolio. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1903.9199999999998s)]
*  Wonderful. And Alexis and George, if people want to get in touch with the Hayward activist coalition [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1904.9599999999998s)]
*  that you co-founded four years ago, where can they go? [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1912.32s)]
*  They can go to haycoco.org. George, correct me if I get any of this wrong. It's haycocoa.org. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1916.72s)]
*  And we have interest forms and contact forms for people to reach out. And we're also on Instagram. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1926.72s)]
*  And is it called X now? I'm not on that. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1931.6s)]
*  Soon. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1936.1599999999999s)]
*  All of our handles are at haycocoa.org on Instagram, Twitter slash X and Facebook. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1937.3000000000002s)]
*  And I'm also reachable at Haystack. George, if anybody's interested in learning about how [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1944.74s)]
*  I navigated council. And I think the last note I want to add here to Nome's point, [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1950.26s)]
*  and what I want to encourage activists to think about is that every approach is going to be a [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1954.74s)]
*  little different. I don't want folks to fall into a one size fits all. I've been asked a lot, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1958.98s)]
*  do you have a template of that resolution? And again, every city is different. And so [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1963.06s)]
*  some creativity, some research is required, but that shouldn't deter us from getting this across [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1967.7s)]
*  the finish line. Well, thank you all so much for being with us on the Electronic Intifada podcast. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1971.22s)]
*  George Serap, Nome Perry, Alexis Villalobos. And we look forward to more activists getting inspired [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1978.8999999999999s)]
*  and passing resolutions like the one in Hayward in January. Thank you all so much for everything [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skuo8AUN9Hw&t=1988.1799999999998s)]
