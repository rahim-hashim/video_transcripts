Video Description: ‚ÄúThis is my memory. This is my history. This is my life,‚Äù 81-year-old Yacoub Odeh tells us about his childhood and experience of expulsion from the Jerusalem village of Lifta in 1948. 
"The beautiful life that I dream ‚Ä¶ and struggle to restore this beautiful life, to go back home. To go back home. To plan our village, to renovate our houses, and to live ‚Ä¶ like everyone [else] under the sun,‚Äù he says.
On episode 41, we speak to Odeh about Lifta and his community‚Äôs 73-year struggle to return to their homes.
We are also joined by Umar al-Ghubari of Zochrot, an organization promoting acknowledgment and accountability for the ongoing injustices of the Nakba.
Al-Ghubari and Odeh both lead political tours inside Lifta, where Odeh and other refugees from Lifta are forbidden to return to live under Israel‚Äôs racist laws.
The Israel Land Authority, a government agency which functions to push Palestinians off their land and lease it to Jewish Israelis, recently announced that it would open bids from real estate development companies to build settlement colonies and boutique hotels on the ruins of Lifta.
Palestinians have urged UNESCO, the United Nations‚Äô cultural body, to intervene.
Lifta is one example of hundreds of Palestinian cities, towns and villages that were ethnically cleansed by Zionist militias in the late 1940s, al-Ghubari notes.
The Nakba, he explains, was Israel‚Äôs ‚Äúsystematic policy of ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people from everywhere in order to achieve the goal of the creation of a Jewish state.‚Äù
This is not the first time Israel has attempted to demolish the village.
As architect Antoine Raffoul wrote ten years ago for The Electronic Intifada, since its depopulation in 1948-49, Lifta has been kept deserted by the Israeli authorities and has long faced demolition by speculative developers.
As a last act of architectural violation, Raffoul writes, Israeli settlers have destroyed the elegant domed roofs in an attempt to prevent a return by Lifta‚Äôs legitimate owners.
‚ÄúThey want to change our beautiful village [into] a colony,‚Äù Odeh says. ‚ÄúAt no time will we keep silent. We will resist. We will struggle, we will go to the court as we did in the beginning.‚Äù

*  joining us on the Electronic Intifada podcast. Thank you very much for inviting us. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=120.56s)]
*  Yaqub, let's start with you. You're originally from Lifta. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=128.16s)]
*  Talk about what you remember growing up in the village and what happened in 1948 when you were [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=132.24s)]
*  just a child. I remember I was born in Lifta. I remember the beautiful life [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=141.76s)]
*  Lifta. I remember my family, hug of my parents, the kids that I played with them in the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=154.79999999999998s)]
*  water spring and in the gardens that we named it Janayan, paradise. I remember my school. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=167.76s)]
*  I remember Lifta, everything in Lifta. That time the life was so simple. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=186.0s)]
*  So Lifta was my world. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=198.0s)]
*  Lifta, I remember especially the area where I was living. Our house was the most closed house [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  to the water spring. We have a house, two floors, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=220.24s)]
*  the aliyah, the salon, with veranda. From the veranda we can watch the three directions in Lifta, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  east, west and north, the movement in the life in the village. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=243.51999999999998s)]
*  And we have other two rooms down. I remember we have chicken we used to go down and take the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=251.84s)]
*  eggs and drink it directly without. I remember the people in the gardens. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=262.47999999999996s)]
*  Thursday, Friday it's off. So some of them used to sleep there and cook from plants there. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=274.79999999999995s)]
*  So you can smell and know what they are cooking, the natural smell for that. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=286.48s)]
*  I remember my mother when she go to Tabun. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=299.84000000000003s)]
*  I catch her dress and go with her to Tabun and make me small cake when I was three, four years. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=308.24s)]
*  But when I was five, six years, I remember my mother when she leave the Tabun, the victory, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=316.32000000000005s)]
*  and the bread on her head on an ashtray like the sun. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=325.36s)]
*  The smell of the bread, Tabun bread, is a different thing. So delicious to eat. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=333.36s)]
*  Delicious meal to eat bread from Tabun and oil olive and za'atar. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=342.0s)]
*  I remember that beautiful life and I remember also [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=353.52s)]
*  the miserable life condition caused by the Zionist groups [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=358.8s)]
*  that they destroyed our life. I remember when they began to shoot our house face to face [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=377.36s)]
*  with the upper part of Lifta. We were living in the roots down in the lower part. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=386.72s)]
*  So I remember that. I remember one day we were in an old building down far from in the night, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=396.0s)]
*  far from shooting. And I remember also when we couldn't go to school, I was so sad [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=408.96000000000004s)]
*  that I cannot go to school. The school in the upper part between the upper and down also. So [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=422.24s)]
*  I think Lifta village has its specialty, the position, the location of Lifta. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=431.76s)]
*  It is its location source strategy. It is the main [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=444.32s)]
*  gate for Jerusalem. So anyone who wants to leave Jerusalem or come to Jerusalem should [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=453.68s)]
*  pass Lifta, the upper part. So the Zionist armed gangs put Lifta on the first point on their list [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=472.16s)]
*  to kick out. And this is, not only the gangs, the leaders, the Zionist leaders, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=486.4s)]
*  the Bingo people, they said we can't do this or that without kicking the people. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=497.59999999999997s)]
*  He moved his head like this and kicked them out. Till now, this is a policy for the Zionist movement [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=505.76s)]
*  in Palestine. I remember all these things. I remember one time my mother was preparing to [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=518.72s)]
*  hit the room. The gangs began to shoot. I was with my small brother, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=531.44s)]
*  a young. He shouted, mama, mama, they shoot us. They shoot us. Our mother took us to the corner [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=539.04s)]
*  inside the house under a table so as to protect us. I remember these things and I remember also [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=549.92s)]
*  one time my father came and carried [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=559.36s)]
*  my small sister on his shell and caught the small brother with his hand and we followed him in the [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=571.28s)]
*  valley, far from the gangs because the gangs at the beginning, they controlled the upper parts [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=584.08s)]
*  physically after they bombed 20 houses. And as said, the oral [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=595.2s)]
*  history, historical men, they said they bombed the houses so as to cleansing [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=603.6s)]
*  the people from the area. And this is what happened. Most of our, the Palestinians went down [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=619.6800000000001s)]
*  to Lifta, some to Jerusalem. But after that, 29 of December 1947, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=629.68s)]
*  1947, so they controlled the upper part, the gate, the Western gate for Jerusalem. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=641.76s)]
*  Day after day, they became stronger more and more. Why? Because the British army [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=653.52s)]
*  wanted to leave. So they moved the military equipment to the Zionist armed gangs so they [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=660.0s)]
*  became able to control also the bypass road that Lifta Weiss founded after they couldn't go to [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=671.04s)]
*  Jerusalem in the way that they used to go and come. We became, Lifta Weiss, under siege. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=680.96s)]
*  They sent some of the kids, the kids' women to the caves after it was in safety. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=697.52s)]
*  So after that, under shooting, they took shelter in the near villages like Nabi Simuel, Beit Hanina, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=708.32s)]
*  Shofat. And after, I can say in the beginning of March, the second half of April, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=722.1600000000001s)]
*  of February, and the beginning of March, Lifta was completely under siege. So [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=738.72s)]
*  we went with our father in the valley. We climbed to Jerusalem, Yaffa Road. There we found a track. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=750.32s)]
*  In the back of the track, there were four families' children, and we became the fifth family children. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=765.6800000000001s)]
*  Our father left us and went home. He remained with the resistance people, with the fighters [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=780.0s)]
*  who struggled to defeat Lifta and the area. Till Dariusine, we went. The track moved. The track [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=792.32s)]
*  moved to Elbeira. We were only, we have nothing, only the clothes we dressed. We have nothing, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=803.76s)]
*  only the key with our father, and we became Elbeira refugees. In one hour, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=818.7199999999999s)]
*  in one hour, we became refugees. We were kings in our village. Everything we need, we have from our [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=830.8s)]
*  land. Everything. Plants, fruits, vegetables, especially we have rain water, always. And also, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=840.88s)]
*  we have animals, cows, sheep, we have meat, we have milk, we have eggs. The life was so simple. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=852.48s)]
*  This is what we want. That time, we do not know television, nor laptop, nor anything. So I say, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=862.24s)]
*  we were kings in our village, and in one hour, we became refugees. Next day, we were knocking [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=872.16s)]
*  houses. We need food. What I want to say, Lifta wasn't stones. Lifta was a life. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=880.9599999999999s)]
*  People are working in the gardens. Others [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=891.6s)]
*  working in the gardens, others taking water to home, ladies bringing water from the water [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=906.36s)]
*  spring or going to the market, other students going to school, some going to his as an employee [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=921.5600000000001s)]
*  going to his work, this is the life. That is planting, that is gathering the corn or gathering [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=933.16s)]
*  the oil, olive fruits. This is the life. So that the zionist, the zionist gangs or the zionist [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=945.24s)]
*  movement by the British occupation destroyed not only the stones, destroyed our life, destroyed [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=957.56s)]
*  our social life, our economic life, our culture life, our political everything they destroyed. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=970.5999999999999s)]
*  This is what Nakba means. Nakba does not mean that we are in conflict about this house or about [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=980.68s)]
*  that land as that wife of the husband of the former president of the United States. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=988.28s)]
*  This is what Kushner said that it's conflict on a piece of land or houses or this. He's stupid, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1000.84s)]
*  he does not know what means. And so this is the thing that this is my memory, this is my [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1013.88s)]
*  history, this is my life. To me, it's the beautiful life that I dream and work also, struggle [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1028.44s)]

*  Lyftawi's children, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1087.72s)]
*  studied the story that no way to forget, no way to forgive, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1093.24s)]
*  that they made the Nakba, shared the Nakba, till we go back home, till we go back. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1102.3600000000001s)]
*  Thank you, Yaacoub. Omar, when just a cursory look at the way that Israeli media and the government [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1115.96s)]
*  and American or European corporate media as well, when they talk about Lyftawi, they call it [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1127.32s)]
*  abandoned or an ancient village, like Roman era, in order to obscure and erase deliberately [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1134.4399999999998s)]
*  the living history that Yaacoub is talking about. Can you give us a sense of [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1146.4399999999998s)]
*  of politically what's happening right now in Lyftawi and how the Israeli government is once [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1153.8s)]
*  again trying to erase the history there and make it impossible for people like Yaacoub [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1162.12s)]
*  to go back to their homes? [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1171.08s)]
*  Yeah, first of all, thank you again for organizing this interview. After the words of Mr. Yaacoub, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1174.84s)]
*  I'm speechless. He's the best person to talk about everything in Lyftawi. He's actually my mentor. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1183.48s)]
*  The things that I know about Lyftawi, I learned from him. I joined him many times in his tours [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1190.68s)]
*  in Lyftawi, and he joined our tours with our groups when we organized as a whole an activity [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1196.3600000000001s)]
*  and tours in Lyftawi. So really, we are blessed to have this young 80 years old man. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1203.88s)]
*  I was this morning in Lyftawi. This was the last time that I visited Lyftawi. I had a group, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1217.88s)]
*  a German group with me, in order to tell them the story of Lyftawi. The last two weeks also [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1222.76s)]
*  were very busy with groups, activists, Palestinians, and internationals, even some [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1229.56s)]
*  Israelis asked to come to Lyftawi to learn about the village. The work that we try to do in Lyftawi, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1235.0s)]
*  it is a political work. It's a kind of resistance against the consciousness and the [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1242.52s)]
*  blindness and the ignorance that the Israeli government is interested to shape or to deliver [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1250.52s)]
*  to the public. We try to open their eyes and to raise the awareness about what really happened [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1257.4s)]
*  to the village of Lyftawi. By the way, as Yaacoub said, as one example of hundreds of Palestinian [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1263.64s)]
*  towns, it's not the only exceptional case. And when you realize that it's not exceptional, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1271.0800000000002s)]
*  you can understand that the Nakba meaning is the Israeli systematic policy of ethnic cleansing [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1276.6000000000001s)]
*  of the Palestinian people from everywhere in order to succeed or to achieve the goal of creation [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1285.88s)]
*  Jewish state. I can say from my experience, the Nakba was not as a result of a war, was not as [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1293.64s)]
*  a reaction of any objection of the Palestinians of any plan. It was a need and a step that the [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1301.4s)]
*  Zionist movement and the state of Israel must do in order to create Jewish state. It was not as a [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1312.52s)]
*  result of the Jewish state creation, it was in order to create a Jewish state. So it must be done, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1318.1200000000001s)]
*  which actually fits any colonial project in the history that we know. The crimes are part of the [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1328.2s)]
*  of the plan. It's built in over there. Even the Israelis like to avoid that or to deny [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1336.76s)]
*  that they did the Nakba. I'm happy to say that through our work in destroyed Palestinian villages [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1347.24s)]
*  and of course in Lyftawi, we managed politically to raise the awareness and to let people face and be [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1354.84s)]
*  challenged with the stories and the facts and the ruins of each destroyed Palestinian town. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1365.08s)]
*  Because of that, we can't avoid that it happened. We just ask the simple questions, what these [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1373.8799999999999s)]
*  empty houses are doing over here? What are the people? What happened to the people? Why they left [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1380.6799999999998s)]
*  and why they didn't come back? We try through this activity and these tools to [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1388.04s)]
*  to challenge the Israeli myths and the Israeli arguments that they usually bring to us. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1398.9199999999998s)]
*  Okay, it was a war and in every war there are victims and it happened and it's happening [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1406.1999999999998s)]
*  everywhere. But it's not the fact. The example of Lyft is very important to prove [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1410.28s)]
*  that the ethnic cleansing policy started very early in the end of 1947. The expulsion of [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1419.0s)]
*  Palestinian communities did not start after the war between Israel and the Arab armies [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1427.16s)]
*  that started on May 15th. When we reached May 15th, we are already with about 40 percent of [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1433.24s)]
*  the Palestinians were expelled and 40 percent of the towns were already occupied and Lyft one of [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1440.0400000000002s)]
*  them. Even more that the Israeli argument regarding the partition plan that the [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1446.52s)]
*  Palestinian side rejected the partition plan and we see that on the ground also the Zionist militias [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1455.16s)]
*  didn't go according to the partition plan because Lyft was outside of the upper Jewish state [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1461.48s)]
*  and they started to attack Lyft in December 1947. And maybe what Jacob missed to mention [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1468.68s)]
*  that the attacks were very brutal. This was a massacre in the coffee shop in the upper part of [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1477.64s)]
*  Lyft. Israeli militia members of the Lehi came to the coffee shop and shot the people and murdered [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1482.28s)]
*  six people and wounded seven. This was the first brutal attack on civilians in the houses in Lyft [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1490.84s)]
*  and this caused a gradual expulsion of families that they were close to the areas that were [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1499.6399999999999s)]
*  dangerous to live close to the Jewish neighborhoods. The Israeli government don't want people to know [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1507.8799999999999s)]
*  these facts and during the last 73 years did the stages and the steps that it did in other places [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1517.0s)]
*  in other Palestinian places. It started with the expulsion of the Palestinian families. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1527.88s)]
*  By the way David Ben-Gurion said in February 1948 regarding Lyft when you come to Jerusalem [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1535.56s)]
*  through Lyft and Sheikh Badr and Jaffa Street and King George Street they are all clean of strangers. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1542.36s)]
*  100% Jews and he meant the Palestinians. He meant Yaacoub. Odi is not living at his home. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1550.1999999999998s)]
*  So the Israelis wanted to clean up the area of Palestinians to expel the Palestinians and they [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1558.9199999999998s)]
*  don't want to acknowledge that. They don't want to teach their kids even in the schools, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1565.48s)]
*  in the Israeli schools, what they did and why they did this expulsion. They don't want to [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1572.28s)]
*  acknowledge that they made war crimes and crimes against humanity through the Nakda [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1580.76s)]
*  by expulsion of the Palestinians beside the massacres that they did in some dozens of places. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1588.6s)]
*  The Israeli mainstream media will not talk about the houses in Lyft as Palestinian houses, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1598.12s)]
*  of Palestinian heritage. They don't want to talk about the mosque in very bad situation in the [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1608.84s)]
*  center of Lyft and they don't want to talk about the desecrated cemetery of Lyft. The people of [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1614.92s)]
*  Lyft asked many times the Israeli authorities to protect the cemetery and to build a fence [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1620.6000000000001s)]
*  around the cemetery and they refused. The Israeli television station, the official one, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1629.8000000000002s)]
*  operated for for tens of years in the land of Lyft, a few hundred meters of the cemetery of Lyft. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1638.3600000000001s)]
*  In this TV station, every Jewish cemetery that was vandalized in the far away in the United States [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1647.24s)]
*  or any place, it will jump to the prime time news in Israel that Jewish tombs or Jewish [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1654.92s)]
*  cemeteries were vandalized somewhere. But they are living on a land and they can even sometimes [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1662.28s)]
*  see the Palestinian cemeteries from the window of their TV office. They don't talk about it. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1669.56s)]
*  So the level of ignorance among the Israelis in the whole levels, in the official circles and the [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1676.84s)]
*  public circles and among the media and the curriculum in the schools, everywhere it's [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1684.76s)]
*  almost complete. They don't want to talk about the Nakba and their part in creating the Nakba. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1692.36s)]
*  The next step will be the Israeli decision in June 1948. This is very important to remember that the [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1701.8799999999999s)]
*  Israeli government had a discussion about the Palestinian refugees already in June in the middle [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1709.16s)]
*  of the so-called the war and the expulsions and they decided not to allow them to come back and [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1716.1200000000001s)]
*  they gave orders to the soldiers on the lines to shoot people who try to come back to their homes [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1721.64s)]
*  and thousands of Palestinians had been killed just because they wanted to step back to their homes, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1729.48s)]
*  sometimes just to take some food that they forgot in the house or stuff or a bed or something from [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1734.36s)]
*  their own land. The next step will be to Judaize and Hebrewize and Israelize the [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1740.04s)]
*  landscape to make it Jewish, to make it for the Israelis, which means to erase and to [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1749.0s)]
*  destroy the Palestinian identity of the place. Lifta in the first stage, the houses of Lifta [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1756.84s)]
*  were given to Israeli Jewish families that immigrated to the country in the early [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1764.12s)]
*  50s and the end of 1949. So imagine that Jewish families colonizing the Palestinian houses [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1771.3999999999999s)]
*  while the Palestinian families are waiting a few hundred meters from there, some of them, or in [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1781.4799999999998s)]
*  not so far from there to come back or to return to their property. So this is the ongoing [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1787.72s)]
*  policy of colonizing and destroying the Palestinian identity of the place [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1795.4s)]
*  expresses actually the ongoing Nakba. Nakba is not a historical event that happened in 1948 and ended [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1802.68s)]
*  there, it's still ongoing. In the 70s, the Jewish families left the houses of Lifta, they claimed [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1809.16s)]
*  new flats, new buildings, they didn't like living in Lifta, they missed actually, they just lost [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1819.8000000000002s)]
*  the opportunity to continue to colonize the amazing places and houses of Lifta. But [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1829.3200000000002s)]
*  we know that in the early 70s, 90% of the Jewish families will leave the houses of Lifta, they move [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1835.5600000000002s)]
*  to a new public housing that built by the Israeli government and the area of Lifta declared as an [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1844.52s)]
*  open space, open park, garden, without touching anything in it, but also without taking care of [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1852.52s)]
*  the Palestinian houses and the heritage and even made a damage for the whole Palestinian houses [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1862.04s)]
*  by making a hole in the headstone of the roofs, they took out the headstones, which is the crucial [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1868.12s)]
*  and the most important stone in this kind of structure and architecture in Lifta. So they [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1874.2s)]
*  wanted the houses to be cracked in order to destroy them somewhere. In 2000, in the years of 2000s, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1882.04s)]
*  2004, there was a plan published by the Israeli authorities in order to build an Israeli Jewish [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1890.04s)]
*  neighborhood in Lifta, which means when the Israelis talk about building neighborhoods, [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1900.76s)]
*  it means they are going to destroy something, it means destruction of dozens of Palestinian houses [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1907.1599999999999s)]
*  that's still standing in the center of the village of Lifta. Thanks to the campaign that [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1914.36s)]
*  Yaacoub Odi and the representatives of the Lifta refugees succeeded to freeze or to stop the [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1921.7199999999998s)]
*  the plan in 2014 and the Israeli court in 2012 and the Israeli court sent the authorities to make [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1931.88s)]
*  the archaeological survey that they missed to do, that they didn't do according to the Israeli law, [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1944.92s)]
*  but unfortunately they did that. They finished in 2018 and the report was prepared and since then [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1950.6000000000001s)]
*  we didn't hear about the steps that the authorities want to do till two months ago, [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1959.24s)]
*  we knew about through the Israeli newspapers and the decision of the Israeli Jerusalem [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1965.56s)]
*  municipality that they want to renew the plan of destruction of Lifta and building a new Israeli [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1974.04s)]
*  neighborhood. They talk about building about 260 luxury apartments and villas, building a hotel [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1980.36s)]
*  and a museum and a mall in the historical Lifta, which is actually make Lifta under threats and [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=1991.08s)]
*  under serious dangers to be erased totally. By the way, when we talk about Lifta today, [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2000.92s)]
*  we talk only about the center and the oldest part of the village. This is the root of the village [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2007.08s)]
*  that Yaacoub mentioned, but Lifta was much wider and bigger than that area and the other parts of [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2012.84s)]
*  Lifta, no one is talking about them. They had completely Israelized and Judaized. They are under [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2018.84s)]
*  the Israeli neighborhoods of Romeimah and the Israeli parliament and the Israeli high court [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2026.84s)]
*  for justice. Imagine the high court for justice is built on the lands that belong to refugees. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2031.8799999999999s)]
*  All these parts of Lifta are totally erased, but what remained from Lifta as a symbol of the [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2039.1599999999999s)]
*  heritage of the people of Lifta, at least we must do what we can do to do our best in order to protect [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2045.6399999999999s)]
*  this part of the village and to try to keep it as a symbol first in the first step, but also as an [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2054.52s)]
*  optional place that people can implement their return or at least part of their justice that [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2064.12s)]
*  they deserve, part of their right to come back to this place and their right on their own property. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2071.56s)]
*  Thank you Omar. In no time I forget the massacre. Why? Because I remember the funeral [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2079.08s)]
*  of the old people that killed in the massacre, 29 November 1947. I remember that, no, I mean [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2099.3999999999996s)]
*  in 29 December, 29 December, 29 December, we were sitting on the balcony of our house, [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2121.88s)]
*  many women and men coming down to the yard of the water spring. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2140.2000000000003s)]
*  I asked my mother, she was weeping, why the woman weeping? What is this? My mother said, [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2156.12s)]
*  you ask many questions in difficult times. I kept silent. After that they prayed in the yard [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2164.6s)]
*  on the funerals and took them to the graveyard. After that my mother said, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2177.4s)]
*  you ask me what is this? Why they are weeping? Why are they sad? These are the men killed in the [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2186.52s)]
*  massacre in Saleh Isa coffee, Leftaweez coffee. So I remember that. Also I want to add to what [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2198.8399999999997s)]
*  you said. Now they want to change our village, our beautiful village for a colonial colony. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2215.2400000000002s)]
*  In no time we will keep silent. We will resist. We will struggle. We will go to the court as we [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2233.64s)]
*  did in the beginning with the coalition that other groups and activities against the plan. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2247.0s)]
*  So we will go to the court as we did before. The Israeli authorities made an antiquities survey. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2257.72s)]
*  The result is so good for us, strength us that Lefta is very rich in its historical [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2268.04s)]
*  heritage. It should stand up, keep, save it. And also what they said. They said we found [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2275.64s)]
*  the group that made the survey antiquities survey. They said we found it. They said we found [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2281.3199999999997s)]
*  it. And they found it. And we found it. And we found it. And we found it. And we found it. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2288.2799999999997s)]
*  And also what they said. They said we found the group that made the survey antiquities survey. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2297.16s)]
*  They said we found a new world that we didn't know before. We found Lefta, Kulten, [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2306.36s)]
*  10 levels, historical levels, antiquities. We found 20,000 meters square buildings under the ground [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2314.92s)]
*  and 20,000 meters building on the land. How you want to remove all these things, [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2330.2000000000003s)]
*  we found six olive trees in Lefta. Some of them, some of them since the Roman, Byzantine, [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2343.56s)]
*  and the Crusaders, and also the Ottoman. So this strength our position. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2357.64s)]
*  And I mean when we use the law. But from the main point, Lefta is our right. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2366.92s)]
*  Lefta is our right. It will not be for others. Lefta is our history, our memory, our life. We [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2380.6800000000003s)]
*  will not leave it. We will not keep silence. So we went to UNESCO. We asked UNESCO to register it. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2392.76s)]
*  Yes, they registered it in the primary register. But now we, Lefta is a threatened historical [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2405.4s)]
*  heritage. So I am and you and he and she and everywhere in this world should write to UNESCO, [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2415.0s)]
*  ask UNESCO to keep it as it is now. I know, I want to say not a reality, [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2427.48s)]
*  to say I want to go. Sure, sooner or later, I'll go home. But meanwhile, I am working [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2443.56s)]
*  to my vision to keep Lefta as it is now. As I witness on what happened in the Nakba. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2461.4s)]
*  Lefta did not destroy it completely in the time of war, should not destroy in the time all the [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2473.6400000000003s)]
*  Israelis and United States and the British talking about this. They are cheating. They are lying. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2483.08s)]
*  They are cheating. They are lying. I think [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2493.64s)]
*  this time the West, I know that they can achieve peace. Achieve peace how? [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2502.2s)]
*  When we go back home without solving, without the refugees, the Palestinian refugees, [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2519.0800000000004s)]
*  do not go home, restore their rights. I think it's impossible to have to be peace. No. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2528.1200000000003s)]
*  No. And the history will not stop. Whereas Netanyahu or Bennett or as it is, didn't stop. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2541.8s)]
*  Whereas Hitler or others, it will not stop. The generations are, you know, [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2554.2000000000003s)]
*  many know the case more than us. Lefta children, hundreds go to Lefta and they know every stone [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2566.84s)]
*  what means. Here is the mosque here, the olive breast here, Ali Badr house here is the graveyard. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2582.36s)]
*  Here is our school. The school I studied in one year and two months, still a school, but not for [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2590.76s)]
*  me, for the occupier, for the occupier, for Israelis. I think we will never forget that. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2601.5600000000004s)]
*  And we, the time will, what remains as it is, it will change. And as I said, it will not stop. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2613.72s)]
*  So also we will not stop. We are moving. We are struggling. And [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2625.64s)]
*  I think as the sun sits down, the sun will rise again. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2635.48s)]
*  I'm sure. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2639.8s)]
*  Thank you. Issa, did you have a question you wanted to ask? [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2644.28s)]
*  Yeah, it's really moving to hear your story, Yaqub. Thank you for, you know, giving it to us. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2652.1200000000003s)]
*  And it's important for our viewers and listeners to hear the reality, you know, that affected [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2658.52s)]
*  so many Palestinians, you know, about 800,000 Palestinians were expelled in the same way [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2666.36s)]
*  that you and your family and your, you know, the fellow villagers of Lefta were at the time. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2673.0s)]
*  You know, two thirds of the Palestinian people were expelled in this way and still millions of [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2681.32s)]
*  Palestinian refugees now still remain as refugees to this day. And, you know, as you've said, [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2686.28s)]
*  this is the central injustice at the heart of what is happening in Palestine and what is [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2693.48s)]
*  still going on there today. And the successive rounds of Israeli violence, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2699.64s)]
*  this is what it all stems from. And this is what needs to be re-addressed. And Omar, [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2705.88s)]
*  the point that you made, I think is really, I mean, you made a lot of good points, but [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2713.0s)]
*  one thing I particularly picked up on that I think is important to reiterate in [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2718.2s)]
*  kind of pushing back against Israeli myths is the fact that what the Israelis did and what the [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2722.92s)]
*  Zionist movement did before even Israel was founded in the Nakba, it was pre-planned. It wasn't just [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2731.4s)]
*  a reaction to events. It wasn't, you know, as Israeli mythology still has it often, that it was, [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2739.5600000000004s)]
*  you know, they claimed that it was defensive, which is ludicrous even on the face of it, [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2747.08s)]
*  but the claim is that it was a response to, you know, the so-called invasion of the Arab armies [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2753.16s)]
*  and all this kind of stuff. The key point disproving that, I mean, apart from the whole [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2759.64s)]
*  history when you look at it, but just the key point disproving that is what you said was that [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2766.44s)]
*  by the 15th of May, even before the 15th of May 1948, when the new state of Israel was declared, [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2771.8s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had already been expelled already by that point. So what the [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2780.2000000000003s)]
*  Arab armies did or didn't do is almost irrelevant to that really. I mean, it is irrelevant to that [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2786.92s)]
*  because it was pre-planned in the Zionist movement from its inception, you know, going back to [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2792.04s)]
*  Theodor Herzl, who, you know, talked of spiriting the penniless population across the border. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2798.12s)]
*  So, yeah, I mean, I think that is a really important point for people to understand and [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2806.2000000000003s)]
*  take forward. But Omar, could you tell us maybe a little bit more about the Israeli mythology and [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2812.44s)]
*  how, when there is villages such as Lifta or remains or ruins of villages that were destroyed [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2819.96s)]
*  or partially destroyed in the Nakba, how are those remains treated and approached in [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2828.04s)]
*  the sort of Israeli official narrative in terms of public parks and history? Are they just completely [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2839.8s)]
*  erased or are they, you know, misidentified or how is that sort of presented? [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2848.36s)]
*  Well, first of all, they are not represented. They try to just ignore that and that's it and [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2858.36s)]
*  not let the people notice even that. I go through the GNF parks or forests and I read the signs. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2864.6800000000003s)]
*  It is amazing how they shape the knowledge of the public. They sign inviting the people to go and [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2872.6s)]
*  to visit that point and to see the Roman Bath and you go there and you see Palestinian cemetery [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2881.96s)]
*  in Amoas, for example, and the Roman Bath is an old building in the center of the cemetery or the [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2888.2s)]
*  south of the cemetery, but they want you to see only that building and to ignore the high, the [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2895.48s)]
*  whole area around. So they're erasing thousands of years of history basically. That's right. This is [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2902.04s)]
*  the way how the Israeli official system [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2909.72s)]
*  educating the Israeli public how to ignore the Palestinian history and heritage. In some places, [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2916.44s)]
*  it's very smart for them to keep one building or a few buildings because they didn't have any [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2925.8s)]
*  special plan what to do with them or a strong Israeli guy just insisted to have that building [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2930.76s)]
*  or that property. They will say, okay, we didn't say that none of the Arabs or Palestinians were [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2938.44s)]
*  here. Few of them were here. This is the proof, just few people, few buildings and that's it. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2945.48s)]
*  They don't want us or the public, of course, the Israelis to believe that a nation was here, [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2953.6400000000003s)]
*  a people was here that deserve their homeland and their property. If they were here, they just were [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2960.44s)]
*  small separated groups and tribes and they came here recently accidentally and they just left [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2967.48s)]
*  because they don't want to live with Jews or something like that. In some cases, we have [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2974.1200000000003s)]
*  an amazing quotes of Israeli leaders that in the main road sites, if some Palestinian buildings [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2981.32s)]
*  are still standing, they dealt with that as kind of dirt, kind of obstacle, kind of disturbing the [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=2990.2000000000003s)]
*  view. Golda Meir said the Palestinian houses of the village of Kalounia on the way to Jerusalem [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3001.6400000000003s)]
*  on the side of the main road between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem may remind the people that [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3007.72s)]
*  this is not Jewish heritage, so they must be erased. I think this combination of sometimes to [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3015.72s)]
*  erase that and the other side to use that as a propaganda we didn't destroy, they were not here. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3023.48s)]
*  By the way, you can, for example, see maybe 50 to 60 mosques around the country that they didn't [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3031.7999999999997s)]
*  destroy, but at the same time, they destroyed 500 or 600 mosques and some churches. They can use [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3039.16s)]
*  the standing of the existing mosque as an example. You see, we did not touch the holy places, [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3047.64s)]
*  which is very smart. By the way, most of these mosques are not used as mosques or partly destroyed [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3053.96s)]
*  like the one in Lifta or converted to synagogue like the one in Nishtiona, the Israeli town, [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3061.8s)]
*  or to museum like in Kiryat Shmona, the mosque of the village of Al-Khalasa. I remember seeing a [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3068.28s)]
*  neglected mosque in Tiberias, I think it was many years ago. And it was in the middle of a sort of [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3076.52s)]
*  shopping precinct area and it was very clear that this used to be a mosque and it's just sort of [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3084.6s)]
*  been neglected, you know. Yeah, you're right. So there are different ways how they can, [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3089.32s)]
*  in one side, use for their own propaganda and the other side to erase as much as possible [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3097.64s)]
*  the Palestinian history. And all of them we can define as ignorance, as an eraser from the, not [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3104.12s)]
*  only from the landscape, but also from the mentality, from the knowledge of the public. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3112.76s)]
*  I want to ask, you know, people hearing this or watching this and, you know, feeling [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3123.1600000000003s)]
*  like they have to be able to do something. You know, these plans, the Israel Land Authority is [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3130.5200000000004s)]
*  opening up public bids for developers to, you know, as Yaqub was talking about, to turn it into [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3140.04s)]
*  like these very, you know, luxury apartments and, you know, shopping centers and hotels. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3146.36s)]
*  What can people do? What is the most important thing that people can do right now in order to [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3154.52s)]
*  support Palestinians, you know, who are from Lifta and are struggling to go back [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3160.52s)]
*  and to hold Israel accountable, you know, not just for this crime of ethnic cleansing, [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3167.72s)]
*  but for the ongoing ethnic cleansing, especially the operations that are happening right now, [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3174.52s)]
*  just, you know, down the street from Lifta in Sheikh Jarrah, in Silwan. What can people do? [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3179.64s)]
*  Maybe Yaqub, I'll start with you. Okay. You said the Israel Land Department, [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3186.92s)]
*  it is the main thief that stole the Palestinian property, everything [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3194.6s)]
*  on why they say they are absentee. Right, the whole absentee property. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3205.72s)]
*  I am here and I am not here. I am here. I am only 100 meters [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3215.96s)]
*  far from my house and I have Israeli ID. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3227.56s)]
*  I have the right to go home. But that who came from Australia or Mexico or anywhere in this world [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3235.0s)]
*  has the right to come and to sit instead of me. I think, Yanni, this is will be cheating [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3244.68s)]
*  the national, the world and supporting by USA and [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3256.92s)]
*  all these governments that keep silence in the United Nations. In the best time, [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3268.44s)]
*  they keep silent, but many times they agree the Israeli or USA. What they can, what the people [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3276.52s)]
*  can do for us. One time I was in USA, I made a speech in 34 activities, 20 of them in universities [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3285.8s)]
*  and 14 in non-government associations. Stop house demolition. That was the type. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3302.76s)]
*  And they say, why we do not know these facts? I say, why? The USA television or press, [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3312.2799999999997s)]
*  with me in the field, they report, but I don't know what you allow to hear or not to hear, [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3325.4s)]
*  to read or not to read, to know or not to know. It is up to your government. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3334.2799999999997s)]
*  They say, okay, what we can do? No time. I say you what to do. But I say one thing. United [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3342.2s)]
*  States people put an end for the world in Vietnam. So they can put an end for the occupation in [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3353.96s)]
*  Palestine. Why your taxes change from your food or from your effort or from your work [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3365.16s)]
*  for military equipment for the occupier? Why? The gas, the guns, the military airplanes, everything [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3376.2799999999997s)]
*  funded by your taxes. Ask your people in Congress, where does my taxes go? Why we support occupation? [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3393.24s)]
*  Why? So you can put an end for United States people and also the free, the free, [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3406.44s)]
*  the free, the free world, people in the world can also support us [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3416.04s)]
*  by this to punish the occupier. What are you working? How, how, the [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3423.96s)]
*  the regime, the regime, the last regime in Africa, the best regime in South Africa, [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3435.96s)]
*  Yani, the people there struggle and also the word supported them. They banish the [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3443.3199999999997s)]
*  the resist, the resist government and also here you can support us. We do not need money. We do [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3455.56s)]
*  not need food. Only we need to restore your [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3468.68s)]
*  your your your dignity by not supporting the occupier directly or indirectly. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3476.7599999999998s)]
*  Only, only we ask the world to, Yani, respect their honor, only not to be troops or military [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3492.2000000000003s)]
*  equipment for the occupier. This is what we want, not more. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3504.52s)]
*  Not more. And Omar? I think we should think in two levels of resistance and what to do. The [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3511.88s)]
*  first one is direct and regarding the current situation in Lifta and the new plan of [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3522.44s)]
*  redistruction. I think international campaign and pressure should be done and talking about the case [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3529.56s)]
*  of Lifta and distribute the knowledge about Lifta and the risk and the threat [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3536.44s)]
*  of this plan should be, should arrive the whole channels and circles in the international [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3547.4s)]
*  institutions and international community to make the case international one. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3554.68s)]
*  Because unfortunately the situation inside Israel that Lifta considered according to the [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3559.16s)]
*  international law or to the international relationship between countries as internal [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3565.56s)]
*  Israeli issue because inside the formal border that the international community acknowledged, [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3572.2s)]
*  unfortunately. So at least we can use this international acknowledgement of [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3577.7999999999997s)]
*  the political situation in order to make pressure on Israel. I don't believe governments will do [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3586.52s)]
*  that, but at least NGOs and activists and political movements all over the world can help [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3593.32s)]
*  with raising the voice of the people of Lifta. People that have opportunity to visit [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3600.92s)]
*  Lifta are invited to come to Lifta and to know Lifta and to be there more and more [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3610.6000000000004s)]
*  and to tell the story for more people. And thanks to again that what you do now is part of this [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3617.08s)]
*  resistance and awareness about the steps that people can do. Beside that on the [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3625.8s)]
*  the deeper view about the case of Lifta, I think the discourse and the [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3635.0800000000004s)]
*  story of the Palestinian Nakba and the Palestinian Israeli situation should be changed and we should [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3647.0800000000004s)]
*  use the correct, in my eyes, the correct terminology, the correct language in order to describe what [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3655.32s)]
*  happened in Lifta in 1947, what's happening with Lifta in 2000 to 2001 and what's going on in Sheikh [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3664.12s)]
*  Jarrah and Sirwan and in the area C and in the Dead Sea Palestinian communities. It's all one of [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3671.88s)]
*  one story. It's the whole ongoing Nakba. It's the whole Israel interest for ethnic cleansing of the [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3681.16s)]
*  Palestinians. It's ongoing crime and people should wake up to see the reality in this way, not only [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3688.92s)]
*  to talk about, as we as Yaacub said in the beginning, conflict between two neighbors on [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3696.2000000000003s)]
*  peace of land. It's not, this is the surface of the situation, the deeper meaning of the [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3704.04s)]
*  relationship between the Zionist movement, the state of Israel with the Palestinian people is [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3712.6800000000003s)]
*  colonizing settler entity that should be faced in this way. If we don't realize that this is the [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3718.04s)]
*  meaning of the Israeli entity, so all resistance and all fights against the Israeli policy will [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3728.3599999999997s)]
*  lead to nothing and this is what we experienced in the last 70 years. The international community [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3736.52s)]
*  tried to make a pressure or to make a peace process or negotiation also, but they are looking [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3742.36s)]
*  for the lost coin in the dark area. It's not the correct place to look for. So I hope that we [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3747.56s)]
*  use this opportunity in one hand to put the case of Lifta on the center of our activity [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3757.56s)]
*  and our activism, political activism, and the other side to connect that for the whole process [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3764.36s)]
*  of colonization and settler colonial situation in Palestine. We ask only to apply the United [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3770.6s)]
*  Nations resolutions. So I ask the United States and others to respect their resolutions, [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3782.36s)]
*  these resolutions that Israel is the only state created by United States, [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3795.3999999999996s)]
*  by a United Nations, and it is the only state show its back for all United Nations resolutions. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3804.92s)]
*  This is in one point. In the other point, as for our case now, we are struggling [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3816.44s)]
*  now against the plan. Yes, I can say not less than half of the groups that [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3823.56s)]
*  every year visit Lifta, they are from United States. I respect that. I respect WFM [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3834.68s)]
*  in New York that registered Lifta as one of 25th written historical heritage. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3845.5600000000004s)]
*  I think also what we do now, it's media. Also, these days, the media in United States is better [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3858.76s)]
*  than before. And you can, and the others can also help us to stop this plan by writing [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3869.64s)]
*  to UNESCO, United Nations, UNRWA, United Europe, all these. That Lifta is deserved to stand up [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3891.3999999999996s)]
*  as, let us say, as a historical garden for all. Meanwhile, yes, and to be as a witness for what [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3907.56s)]
*  happened in the network. I think there is a lot of things that they can do and help us [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3919.8s)]
*  to face this plan. And I think our promise to struggle, and I hope we will succeed. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3931.32s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you so much, Jacob. That's the voice of Jacob Odeh. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3943.48s)]
*  He's a son of Lifta and an ambassador to Lifta's heritage and history. And Omar Al-Ghubari, [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3948.84s)]
*  he's with Zohrot. Omar and Jacob, thank you so much for all of the work that you do. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3959.2400000000002s)]
*  Omar is the ambassador of Palestine and Lifta. If I am only the ambassador of Lifta, Omar is the [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3965.08s)]
*  ambassador of Lifta and Palestine. Thank you both so much. Thank you. Thank you very much. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4jVVBQQBKk&t=3973.48s)]
