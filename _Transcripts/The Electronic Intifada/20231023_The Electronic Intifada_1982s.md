# Dr. Mads Gilbert describes "catastrophic disaster" in Gaza | The Electronic Intifada
**The Electronic Intifada:** [October 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns)
*  We want to bring in our good friend, long-time friend, Dr. Mads Gilbert, a Norwegian emergency [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=0.0s)]
*  doctor who has worked in Gaza during successive Israeli attacks. Dr. Mads is speaking to us today [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=8.64s)]
*  from Cairo. He's been trying to join his colleagues in Gaza for the past week and a half. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  Dr. Mads, thank you so much for being here. I can't imagine just the frustration that you must feel [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=21.12s)]
*  as a doctor who has worked in Gaza all these years and is unable to be working with your [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=31.200000000000003s)]
*  colleagues right now at this just catastrophic time. You know, last night the Israeli military [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=38.32s)]
*  reported that there were more than 320 locations across the Gaza Strip that were bombed. It was [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=48.56s)]
*  one of the most intensely bombed, you know, 12, 18 hours that we've seen in the last two and a [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=54.88s)]
*  half weeks. And the Ministry of Health has reported that all of these targets are residential areas, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=64.32s)]
*  of course, that barely needs to be set at this point. And we're also seeing reports from [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=70.24000000000001s)]
*  Gaza Health Ministry, from doctors and nurses, that at least 130 premature babies who are in [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=77.6s)]
*  the neonatal intensive care units in Gaza City hospitals are at, quote, grave risk, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=87.67999999999999s)]
*  according to aid workers, because of the dwindling, scarce electricity and resources [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=95.44s)]
*  and basic medical supplies, medications. In your opinion, as a physician, as someone who's worked [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=102.16s)]
*  in Gaza all these years, how can you assess this catastrophe at this point? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=109.52s)]
*  Well, good evening, good morning, good afternoon. Thank you for inviting me, Ali and Nora. Thank you [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=119.28s)]
*  for the incredibly important work you do to promote advocacy and actual information. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=126.64s)]
*  The situation in Gaza is not a disaster, it's a catastrophic disaster. And what we see playing out [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=133.12s)]
*  live, minute by minute, is the politics of elimination executed against the colonized [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=143.12s)]
*  by the colonizing forces. Because what we see is such a massive attack on the human habitat, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=152.48s)]
*  the civilian population, crushed into the very narrow space by the siege, and also the systematic [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=161.12s)]
*  attack on all the provisions you need to live. And that is not first and foremost hospitals [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=171.83999999999997s)]
*  and ambulances. It is water, it is food, it is electricity, it is human security, and then [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=181.6s)]
*  you may need the medical system. So they are actually choking 2.2 million civilians by [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=191.04s)]
*  thirsting them, starving them, denying them light, denying them warmth, denying them [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=199.84s)]
*  practical possibilities to take care of their children. Then they are bombing them. And then, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=207.44s)]
*  importantly, they are also attacking the medical system, which should be, of course, protected. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=215.04s)]
*  We know from the reports that 10 hospitals of the Gaza hospitals have been closed so far, and 29 [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=221.2s)]
*  primary health care centers, which are incredibly important. As Ali mentioned, this is 2.2 million [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=229.35999999999999s)]
*  people with diabetic patients, with hypertonic patients, with acute myocardial infarctions, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=235.52s)]
*  at any given time, there are 50,000 pregnant women in Gaza. There are 100 deliveries every day. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=242.48s)]
*  Many of them will need cesarean section, and many of the newborn will need follow-up care, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=251.68s)]
*  maybe resuscitation, and maybe incubators. On top of that, you have a patient flow of 15,200 [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=258.08s)]
*  war wounded, of which the last number, 5,000 of the war wounded are children less than 18. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=268.24s)]
*  And as an anesthesiologist and emergency medical doctor, I know that taking care of war wounded [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=277.28s)]
*  children is exceedingly demanding and difficult. You need special equipment, the size of things [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=282.72s)]
*  needs to be right, and the fluids, everything needs to be appropriate for the care of the kids. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=289.92s)]
*  So you have a massive influx of wounded that needs care. You have a population which is already [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=296.56s)]
*  more deceased than a normal population because of the 17 years of siege. And then you have this [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=303.28000000000003s)]
*  brutal attacks on the healthcare system, shutting down hospitals, cutting the supply of energy [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=310.8s)]
*  and water to the hospitals. They have killed so far 54 health workers and injured 90, and I think [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=318.08000000000004s)]
*  they have bombed and rocketed around 30 ambulances. Now, this scenario is such a hell that I think [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=327.6s)]
*  Gaza 2022 makes Dante's Inferno look like a tea party. I will not get distracted in numbers, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=338.08s)]
*  but they are important. But precisely as Ali started, behind every number, there is a family, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=347.59999999999997s)]
*  there is a human being, there is a brother and a sister. And these immense numbers are hard to [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=354.08s)]
*  comprehend unless you have seen it, and I've seen it firsthand. The shrapnels you showed me the picture [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=359.91999999999996s)]
*  of, I actually took one of these shrapnels home to Norway in 2014. They are extremely heavy. They [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=366.96s)]
*  may have this size. The edges are so sharp that you can shave with them, and it's made of a very, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=374.23999999999995s)]
*  very high metal composition, and they fly at hundreds of kilometers per hour, swirl, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=381.2s)]
*  and they cut off limbs. They cut open abdomens. They cut open chests, and if you're lucky, you die. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=387.84s)]
*  If you're not lucky, you're severely injured, and if you're lucky, you get to an OR, and you have [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=394.08000000000004s)]
*  life-saving surgery. If you're not, you will not have life-saving surgery. Our colleagues are telling [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=401.28000000000003s)]
*  us from Gaza that the strangulation of healthcare through the last seven years and the massive [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=407.2s)]
*  influx and the total blockade that Israel imposed two weeks ago makes it impossible to tend to all [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=415.52s)]
*  the injured, and they say that war wounded that could have survived are not left to die because [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=423.84s)]
*  they don't have the capacity and they don't have the practical means to take care of them. So from [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=430.88s)]
*  a medical point of view, you always need to look after the root causes and not just treat the symptoms. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=438.96s)]
*  And I say, as I've said before, the important things now is, number one, to stop the bombing [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=447.76s)]
*  of the civilian population in Gaza immediately, to secure them human security through international [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=455.12s)]
*  protection, to turn on the light and turn on the water to Gaza, to open multiple corridors [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=462.8s)]
*  under international control where you can transport in food, medicine, medical equipment, and, of course, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=471.52000000000004s)]
*  also fuel for the thousands and thousands of generators needed to operate Gaza, even if the [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=481.12s)]
*  light is turned on because the distribution system is so fragile that many institutions and [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=488.96s)]
*  hospitals will need generators. Stop the bombing, lift the siege immediately, open corridors, and [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=494.71999999999997s)]
*  what we have seen so far from Rafa, 20 plus 20, maybe 20 today, is I think that is just a political [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=502.4s)]
*  game trying to fool the world to think that, oh, how nice, now humanitarian help is getting into [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=510.47999999999996s)]
*  Gaza. As Ali said, on a normal day, during the 17 years of siege, Gaza's population needed five to [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=516.4s)]
*  700 truckloads every day of food, of practical stuff to live. So 20 truckloads after two weeks [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=526.48s)]
*  of complete siege and bombing, it is an insult. It is an insult. My colleagues are saying that [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=536.0799999999999s)]
*  they are running out of everything now. And I guess you have noticed that Israeli generals have been [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=543.84s)]
*  repetitiously now threatening the big hospitals, the Mustachf al-Quds, Mustachf al-Shifa, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=551.28s)]
*  and Al-Aqsa to evacuate, threatened to bomb the hospital. The hospital leadership [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=558.16s)]
*  and my brave colleagues, the doctors, the nurses, the paramedics, have refused, and they have said [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=566.5600000000001s)]
*  we will not leave our patients, so this bombing has actually been obstructed. I also want to end [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=572.64s)]
*  by saying, Dr. Eriq and I, we want to go in as we always do, not because we don't think the Palestinian [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=580.48s)]
*  healthcare workers can do this job. They are world-class experts on this, unfortunately. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=589.36s)]
*  We go there to stand shoulder to shoulder with our brothers and sisters in Gaza to bear witness [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=595.76s)]
*  to collect evidence, to treat patients, of course, but most of all to provide what's [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=602.48s)]
*  mostly needed now for the people of Gaza, and that is international solidarity. That is international [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=608.88s)]
*  big solidarity, true solidarity. And also, I would reiterate the call from the Minister of Health [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=616.0s)]
*  three days ago to health workers all over the world to establish medical teams, travel to Egypt, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=623.44s)]
*  come to Egypt, and we will go to Gaza and we will help the completely exhausted teams in Gaza [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=632.16s)]
*  who now have been working around the clock for more than two weeks, not only [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=640.16s)]
*  taking care of their patients, but also worrying intensely for their own families. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=647.76s)]
*  I will end with a short story. One of my best friends in Gaza is a very skilled anesthesiologist, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=653.4399999999999s)]
*  he's young, he's very experienced despite his young age. He has eight kids. One of his kids [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=660.7199999999999s)]
*  is studying medicine in Egypt. On the third day, just after I came down to Cairo, he called me and [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=667.36s)]
*  he said, my brother, Dr. Matz, if we get killed, I want you to father my son. These are the kind [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=674.88s)]
*  of realities that our human brothers and sisters in Gaza are facing now. This is the politics of [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=685.92s)]
*  elimination. This is the Dakhia doctrine in full scale. The Israelis say anywhere from anybody [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=696.56s)]
*  shooting at them from civilians, they define them as legal targets. This is the horrible [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=703.68s)]
*  true face of colonialism. The only solution is the root cause to be solved, and that is a free [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=711.12s)]
*  Palestine. Thank you. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=718.72s)]
*  Dr. Matz, thank you so much. It just, just the sadistic nature of what we're seeing, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=720.72s)]
*  the fact that Joe Biden is congratulating himself for sending, for helping the people [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=733.84s)]
*  for sending, for helping facilitate the sending of 20 trucks for a population being carpet bombed. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=739.12s)]
*  One of those trucks was full of coffins. We're seeing the reports by your colleagues, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=749.76s)]
*  anesthesiologists across Gaza who say that they are performing surgeries without anesthesia because [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=759.36s)]
*  the anesthetic medications have run out. What does that do to the psychology of the physician [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=766.4s)]
*  to have to perform surgeries under these conditions? I can't even imagine. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=777.52s)]
*  Nora, I think we have to realize that also within the field of medicine there is this fog of war [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=785.12s)]
*  and rumors and false news are circulating. Palestinian doctors and nurses do not perform [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=791.76s)]
*  big surgery without anesthesia. They don't. You simply can't. You know, some of the main war wounds [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=799.2s)]
*  are to the abdominal cavity, to the chest cavity, and to the head. If you have a few shrapnels going [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=806.56s)]
*  into the chest, you can put in a chest tube. That you can do in local anesthetic. If you have to go [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=814.08s)]
*  into the abdomen, the patient needs general anesthesia. If we cannot provide that, they will [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=819.36s)]
*  not operate and that patient will die. Because this is another illustration of this attempt to [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=825.28s)]
*  portray the animals in Gaza. Oh, they even operate without anesthesia. They don't. They don't. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=831.92s)]
*  Trust me. I've been there and we've been without anesthetics for some time. Then we try to improvise, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=838.0s)]
*  find other solutions. But by and large, the medical procedures and practices in Gaza [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=843.84s)]
*  are at highest European standards. They do lack now local anesthetics. So there may be some [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=850.96s)]
*  cleaning of wounds. There may be some debridements, some reduction of fractures done without enough [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=858.72s)]
*  local anesthetics. But that is not outside the border of what is ethically acceptable. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=865.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. My second point is about the closure at Raffa. We get many questions. Why are you [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=871.2s)]
*  still in Cairo? And listen, to get from Cairo to Raffa, you need to go through the [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=877.2800000000001s)]
*  the desert, the Sinai Desert. And the Sinai Desert is closed Egyptian military territory. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=886.8000000000001s)]
*  You need permission from the highest security level in the Egyptian military security [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=894.1600000000001s)]
*  establishment. We have the full support from the Norwegian government. Our embassy is working [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=901.2s)]
*  very diligently to get the permissions. We have all the permissions from the civilian part of [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=906.72s)]
*  the Egyptian society and departments. But we were missing that last from the military. And they will [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=912.48s)]
*  not let anybody go to Raffa until they have full control or until they find it suitable for them [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=920.32s)]
*  to let the medical personnel in. So there has not been one single person crossing Raffa since [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=927.44s)]
*  they started in and not one single person going out. It's only these 20, 40, 60 trucks. Otherwise, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=934.8000000000001s)]
*  Raffa is completely sealed off. That of course also needs to be opened immediately. And there must be [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=942.8800000000001s)]
*  permission. The Norwegian government has condemned the siege, the blockade. It has increased its [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=948.48s)]
*  humanitarian support. And it has refused to call Hamas a terrorist organization. So there are some [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=956.16s)]
*  other voices in the West. There are some other independently, you know, political forces. And our [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=965.68s)]
*  Minister of Foreign Affairs was here down during the Cairo meeting. And we had a long talk with him. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=973.1999999999999s)]
*  And we have the full support of our government. And we will stay until we get in. And again, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=978.0s)]
*  the heroes are in Gaza. And I send to anybody who can hear, Palestinian health workers [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=984.4s)]
*  are true heroes of our time. Indeed. Dr. Mads, thank you so much for that. And I wonder if [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=991.36s)]
*  you can tell us if you know of other efforts to organize emergency medical teams. As you say, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1004.56s)]
*  at the moment, the Egyptians are not letting anyone through, Raffa. But hopefully and presumably [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1012.24s)]
*  that will change because of the desperate need. Do you know of other efforts to organize [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1020.48s)]
*  teams to come to be ready to enter Gaza as soon as the permission is granted? [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1026.72s)]
*  Well, Ali, we have tried to sort of get an overview. And it's hard because it's not [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1033.2s)]
*  at the moment there is no coordinated efforts. It's the UN systems and then there is the NGO [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1038.3999999999999s)]
*  system and they have their cluster meetings. But I think what is needed now is not just the big ones [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1043.52s)]
*  organizing things. They, of course, have teams that can come. But what we need now is to mobilize [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1050.32s)]
*  this deluge of medical solidarity from young doctors, young nurses, young paramedics, ambulance [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1058.24s)]
*  people who wants to come. And we know about that because they call us all the time and ask us, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1065.6s)]
*  can we go, please? And we say it has to be organized for our organization. Norwalk, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1071.04s)]
*  we have prepared substitute teams to replace us after we are outworn after two or three weeks. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1076.32s)]
*  So we have a plan. The big ones, of course, Red Cross, Red Crescent, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1084.6399999999999s)]
*  Medecins Sans Fronti√®res and others have teams. This is not coordinated. And the sad thing is that [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1090.4s)]
*  nobody, even if you have a team, is allowed in. So we need to mount the pressure on opening the [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1098.88s)]
*  borders. And I appeal to all US young and old doctors, nurses, ambulance paramedics, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1106.24s)]
*  whatever you have, radiologists, lab physicians, this is the time to stand up for humanity. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1116.88s)]
*  This is the time to show that the Palestinians in Gaza and in the West Bank are not alone. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1123.76s)]
*  This is the time where you write your name in the history books. And on which page you want to be, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1130.3200000000002s)]
*  it's up to you. Now is the time to stand tall in solidarity with the Palestinian people at large, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1136.64s)]
*  and for us in the health care sector to support the Palestinian health workers. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1142.1599999999999s)]
*  Collect money, do whatever you can, but be active. Don't be alone and resist all these malignant [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1146.48s)]
*  campaigns against us who support the Palestinians for being antisemitic. We are not, we are pro [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1154.48s)]
*  Palestinian. We are anti-colonial and we are for the justice and the good life for all people. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1160.48s)]
*  Dr. Mads, thank you for those comments and that appeal. And I think we often forget the important [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1166.24s)]
*  role that the medical community can play in things like this. I wanted to ask you, you have been in [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1175.84s)]
*  Gaza during, you were there during Israel's 2014 massacre and you were there previously. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1184.64s)]
*  What would be the, from your experience, what can you tell us about the conditions that your [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1191.8400000000001s)]
*  colleagues are facing in Gaza right now in Al-Shifa or in any of the hospitals [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1199.3600000000001s)]
*  under these circumstances? And what are you hearing from them? [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1204.8s)]
*  What we are hearing from them in our multiple communications every day and through the nights [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1210.16s)]
*  is that they are deeply affected by the siege and the lack of equipment. Number one, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1216.56s)]
*  the most important deficiency is the lack of fuel for the generators. So the most critical medical [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1223.1200000000001s)]
*  demand now, which must come from our government, is to open Gaza so that the fuel supply can restart [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1230.08s)]
*  the generators. And for Israel to turn on the power to the electric power plants, to the [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1237.76s)]
*  electrical network already existing in Gaza. Then they tell us that they're lacking water. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1245.92s)]
*  The immediate demand is to turn on the water pipeline system and the water pumps. The third [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1252.5600000000002s)]
*  thing they tell us is that it's very difficult to uphold general hygiene and the special hygiene [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1259.28s)]
*  you need for surgical practice because the pressure in the water pipelines when there is pressure is [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1265.2s)]
*  too low to operate the sterilizers, the ones that are sterilizing the medical equipment. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1272.1599999999999s)]
*  Then they tell us that the shared number of injured is so large that they don't have enough [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1280.24s)]
*  operating rooms to amend all of them. And the injuries are horrific. Today we got a new series [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1286.32s)]
*  of pictures from children being almost melted from burns where feet were without toes, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1293.92s)]
*  where the burns had obviously just melted away parts of the extremity. We don't know what kind [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1302.48s)]
*  of weapons these are, but the weapons are horrible. So the complexity and the number of injuries is [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1308.64s)]
*  one more problem. And then, which is maybe one of the most spectacular, horrible things [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1315.3600000000001s)]
*  about the current situation is that there is no safe place in Gaza now. What we saw in 2014 and [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1323.28s)]
*  2009 was that when they bombed quarters, you know, like in a neighborhood, the people from [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1331.84s)]
*  the neighborhood would seek shelter in and around the hospital because they still have [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1337.92s)]
*  an illusion that they are protected through international law. This time the homeless [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1344.6399999999999s)]
*  who have been forced to flee either by the order to move to the south or who has lost their habitat, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1351.8400000000001s)]
*  their home, their apartment or their house. These hundreds of thousands are now flocking into the [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1359.7600000000002s)]
*  hospitals. So the corridors of the hospitals are completely clogged with people having taken [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1365.44s)]
*  refuge there with their kids. And the number of toilets, the number of sinks and towels, [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1373.2s)]
*  whatever you need for personal hygiene is not there. So they describe an extremely difficult [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1380.88s)]
*  situation. And they are not the kind of people who are talking about, first of all, their emotions. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1387.04s)]
*  They are talking about the dignity and the resistance and the medical system as part [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1398.64s)]
*  of the Palestinian resistance against elimination. So they see their role as being part of this [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1407.3600000000001s)]
*  national struggle to now avoid extermination and on the long term to have a free Palestine. So [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1414.96s)]
*  I think the most [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1425.04s)]
*  touching and powerful feature and character among my hundreds and hundreds of friends and colleagues [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1429.9199999999998s)]
*  in the healthcare system in Gaza, it is their state, it is their smooth, their steadfastness [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1439.04s)]
*  and it is their never ending optimism and work energy despite darkness, despite bombing, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1445.6s)]
*  despite not knowing what the family situation is, despite the most horrible injuries, children [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1455.92s)]
*  coming in, despite even getting your own family in as patients, they stand tall. And as they did [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1461.52s)]
*  the other night when the Israelis were bombing closely around Mustafa Al-Quds and Mustafa Shifa, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1466.48s)]
*  as they did also today, they said, we are not leaving our patients. Historical courage [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1473.76s)]
*  and a moral compass for a world which seems in the north having lost their compasses long time ago. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1481.68s)]
*  Dr. Mads Gilbert, we want to thank you so much for the years of work that you have done, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1491.12s)]
*  not only standing shoulder to shoulder with the heroes inside Gaza's medical community, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1499.68s)]
*  but also making sure to highlight the dignity that is Palestinian doctors and physicians and [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1507.52s)]
*  nurses and we thank you for your work. And once again, tell people how they can follow your work [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1518.56s)]
*  and get in touch with NORWAC emergency team. No, no, don't get in touch with me. Don't follow [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1527.12s)]
*  our work. Find your local organization or organize locally. Don't go into the big, big, big, big [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1534.1599999999999s)]
*  bag of huge organizations. We are a very small, very mobile organization. By the way, I travel [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1542.7199999999998s)]
*  on behalf of my university hospital in Northern Norway. They sent me on commission to Gaza, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1548.7199999999998s)]
*  together with NORWAC and Dr. Eric. Organize yourselves. Find local structures, find local [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1554.72s)]
*  organizations. Be mobile, be flexible and don't waste too much time and money on the big structures. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1559.68s)]
*  This is medical guerrilla warfare. This is medical mobility. This is medical speed. And if you want [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1567.52s)]
*  to know, by the way, what it feels like working in Gaza, you could buy my last book, which is [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1578.08s)]
*  called Night in Gaza and which is a description of the horrific conditions during the 2014 [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1585.12s)]
*  assault on Gaza. I'm not saying this, I earn not a nickel on it. All the money goes to the solidarity [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1592.8s)]
*  work, but it is a pretty graphic and close to reality description and you will meet [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1597.6s)]
*  graphic and close to reality description and you will meet in the book many of the nurses, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1603.92s)]
*  doctors and paramedics that are fighting for their patients and for their nation today. Night in Gaza. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1610.48s)]
*  Dr. Mads, one thing I really appreciate is how you do not try to separate [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1617.52s)]
*  quote unquote humanitarian issues from politics because all of this horror that we're seeing, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1625.3600000000001s)]
*  the injuries that you are so desperate to get into Gaza to help treat are caused by [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1631.12s)]
*  political decisions. It's not a hurricane or an earthquake. So I just want to say how important [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1639.9199999999998s)]
*  that is your willingness to speak about colonialism and to tie what's happening to these [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1649.12s)]
*  political realities. One thing I want to ask you, I know that there is no substitute for being in [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1656.0s)]
*  Gaza to be sent side by side with your colleagues there, but is there anything that you're able to [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1663.76s)]
*  do? You mentioned your colleagues sending you pictures of injuries. Is there anything you're [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1672.16s)]
*  able to do from outside in terms of giving them advice or helping to [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1679.12s)]
*  respond to questions they have about treating some of these things? [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1685.4399999999998s)]
*  Thank you, Ali. That's a good question. They don't need advice. They know everything they want. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1692.4799999999998s)]
*  Corporation in order to disseminate information and we work around the clock in our little [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1699.12s)]
*  headquarter here in Cairo. We're by the way in the Palestine hospital in Gaza in Cairo, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1705.36s)]
*  which is operated by the Red Crescent Society, Palestine Red Crescent Society. So we're working [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1714.1599999999999s)]
*  around the clock with distributing information that they send us. We're in close contact with [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1719.6s)]
*  the Red Crescent Society, with the Minister of Health, with the different hospitals. We [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1728.24s)]
*  communicate with our politicians in Norway. We try to keep on top of the development and I think [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1733.84s)]

*  two days ago, three days ago at Berkeley. It's on YouTube. It is the most illuminating [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1776.3999999999999s)]
*  analysis of what is going on now and what is the root cause of what we're seeing now. Ilan Pappe, [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1785.12s)]

*  superficial and for us merely having somebody on the outside to talk with is important for them [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1800.3999999999999s)]

*  night and day. What we need to do now is to have our governments force the US government to say [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1840.88s)]
*  you do not attack any civilian hospital in Gaza, you do not bomb any ambulance, you turn on the [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1848.72s)]

*  they are complicit. Joe Biden will write his name in the dark part of history. If he doesn't soon [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cfzVdxp4Ns&t=1862.8000000000002s)]
