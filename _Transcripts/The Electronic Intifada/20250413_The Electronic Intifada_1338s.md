Video Description: ‚ÄúThe only thing that will help us deliver medical care is full liberation for Palestinians,‚Äù Dr. Tarek Loubani, a Canada-based emergency physician tells The Electronic Intifada Podcast.
He joined us to talk about the medical catastrophe inside Gaza, after Israel closed all the crossings in early March, and several weeks after it resumed mass-scale airstrikes on Palestinians.
Loubani is the co-founder of Glia, an international medical solidarity organization with field clinics inside Gaza.
We discussed the Israeli army‚Äôs impunity following its executions of 15 medics and rescue workers in Rafah on 23 March, their bodies found in a mass pit a week later.

# How Gaza's doctors endure the impossible, with Dr. Tarek Loubani
**The Electronic Intifada:** [April 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4)
*  Hello and welcome back to the Electronic Intifada podcast. I'm Nora Barrows-Freedman. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=0.0s)]
*  I wanted to bring Dr. Tarek Lubani back on to talk about the medical catastrophe inside [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=5.22s)]
*  Gaza a month after Israel closed all the crossings and two weeks after it resumed mass scale [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=10.72s)]
*  airstrikes on Palestinians killing at least a thousand people. Tarek is an emergency doctor [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=18.04s)]
*  based in Ontario and is the co-founder of the GLIA project, an international medical [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=24.159999999999997s)]
*  solidarity organization with field clinics inside Gaza. Tarek, welcome back to the Electronic [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=29.839999999999996s)]
*  Infada podcast. Thank you so much for having me, Nora. Thanks for returning with us. And first [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=35.68s)]
*  off, I just wanted to get your reaction on the story on the bodies of 15 medics with the Palestine [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=44.32s)]
*  Red Crescent Society and the Civil Defense Corps in Gaza were found. Israeli forces had summarily [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=53.56s)]
*  executed them in Rafah and threw their bodies into a pit. Can you talk about your reaction to [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=59.72s)]
*  these horrific execution of medics and what message Israel is sending not just to Palestinian [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=67.60000000000001s)]
*  physicians and patients, but also to the world about this level of impunity that it's operating [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=74.6s)]
*  under? You know, the funny thing is that we all knew this would eventually happen. Just like you [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=81.2s)]
*  said, impunity is such a large player in how the Israelis behave. And the Israelis didn't go from [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=88.28s)]
*  zero to monster in one day. They took it very gradually. I remember I spoke in front of the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=95.24000000000001s)]
*  United Nations during what's called a commission of inquiry on the Great March of Return, where I [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=101.0s)]
*  was the only named victim because even though there were 6,000 people shot with live fire, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=105.68s)]
*  almost everybody was too afraid to present because they knew that there would be consequences from [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=111.11999999999999s)]
*  the Israelis. And having the luxury of Canadian citizenship and living most of the time outside [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=116.16s)]
*  Gaza, I was able to be a named victim. When I sat and spoke to the United Nations, the council that [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=121.6s)]
*  had assembled to receive this report, I said, look, you know, what has happened today and your [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=128.56s)]
*  actions today will dictate how the Israelis behave tomorrow. And I do not want to be one of the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=133.35999999999999s)]
*  victims when they get the message that this is okay. And I do not want to see the other victims [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=139.76000000000002s)]
*  when they get the message that this is okay. Unfortunately, the world is one of the key [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=145.44s)]
*  perpetrators that's walking hand in hand with Israel. Israel cannot carry out this genocide [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=152.24s)]
*  alone. We know that. We know that. We know that beyond a shadow of a doubt. And even though we [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=156.96s)]
*  can look to, for example, the Americans as a key partner, really when it comes to something like [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=162.48s)]
*  what we saw happen with these field executions, there's a direct path that's traced directly to [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  the inaction of the international community led by the United Nations. They can and should do [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=175.67999999999998s)]
*  something about it. Otherwise, we're going to see more. I mean, think, Nora, of a year ago today, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=182.16s)]
*  think of how depraved already what the Israelis had done to the medical community was. By a year [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=188.95999999999998s)]
*  ago today, they had killed some of my best friends. They had annihilated so many of the hospitals. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=194.55999999999997s)]
*  They had bombed and destroyed and pillaged and looted. And what did we see from the international [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=200.16s)]
*  community? Nothing at all. The mildest of statements, not at all proportional or rising to [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=207.04s)]
*  the occasion. So I am, of course, devastated and absolutely disgusted by what happened. I am [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=213.76s)]
*  disgusted at the Israelis. The Israelis are the ones who are responsible. The Israelis, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=220.56s)]
*  with their criminality and depravity, are the ones whose fingers are on the trigger. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=225.6s)]
*  But the whole world is right there patting their shoulders saying, go ahead and shoot. Nothing will [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=230.56s)]
*  happen. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=235.92s)]
*  And of course, this is on top of the complete systematic destruction of the medical community [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=239.44s)]
*  inside Gaza over the last 18 months. Can you talk a little bit about what your colleagues are saying, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=250.23999999999998s)]
*  the kinds of injuries that your colleagues are dealing with now in terms of trying to treat [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=260.0s)]
*  patients who have been injured in airstrikes while basic items such as sterile gauze and Tylenol [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=265.12s)]
*  are gone, let alone appropriate equipment or even antibiotics? Tell us what you're hearing from your [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=272.72s)]
*  colleagues and how we can understand this phase of the genocide and specifically Israel's [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=280.48s)]
*  engineered medical catastrophe in Gaza. Yeah, of course, the medical catastrophe, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=285.84000000000003s)]
*  I'll talk about it a little bit more, but there's a particular mix that's happening here. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=292.96s)]
*  The way Israel is behaving right now is like all of us have in our lives people who are party [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=297.91999999999996s)]
*  poopers. They don't like to see anybody having fun or even living life. And Israel is that mixed [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=303.68s)]
*  in with the most depraved psychopathic genocidal tendencies. So for example, on Eid, the murders [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=311.28s)]
*  went up in such a depraved and criminal way. On Ramadan, when Ramadan started, it was as though [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=318.8s)]
*  the very idea of Palestinians being at peace in even the smallest way was just so unacceptable. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=325.76s)]
*  They cut off all food. I mean, that's not coincidental. It's not coincidental at all. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=332.16s)]
*  It is that the Israelis are seeking the absolute complete destruction of Palestinians. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=337.28000000000003s)]
*  I know I've heard so many people say like in whole or in part. What in part? What in part exists right [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=344.8s)]
*  now? It is so clear that Israelis will not rest until every single Palestinian is dead. And that [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=352.08000000000004s)]
*  is a commitment on the part of the Israeli state. That is clear. It used to be that we used to say, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=358.96000000000004s)]
*  oh, well, Gaza, but not the West Bank. Who can say that anymore? So when you talk about this [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=365.04s)]
*  engineered medical catastrophe, firstly, it's part of a layer of depravity. It's not a medical [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=370.72s)]
*  catastrophe to deny people food. That's a humanitarian catastrophe. It's not a medical [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=378.64000000000004s)]
*  catastrophe to deny people movement in and out. That's a humanitarian catastrophe. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=384.16s)]
*  The medical catastrophe sits as part and parcel of something much, much larger that's happening. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=390.64000000000004s)]
*  Of course, the Israelis don't want Palestinian physicians to keep practicing medicine. They look [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=397.36s)]
*  at the practice of medicine as the antithesis of their goal, which is to destroy, to kill, to [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=403.84s)]
*  loot, to pillage, to rape, and to absolutely eliminate all Palestinians. So I think what is [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=410.71999999999997s)]
*  clear, this was clear before, really, it was clear before October 7th. But what is clear beyond the [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=417.52s)]
*  shadow of a doubt right now is that the Israelis are absolutely trying to engineer the destruction [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=423.36s)]
*  of Palestinians in every possible way. So for example, when we look at what they've done in [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=429.52000000000004s)]
*  hospitals, let's look at just the basics. Materials are not present at all. So that's a key. You have [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=435.6s)]
*  somebody who's wounded in front of you. You want to put a piece of gauze on them. You can't. You want [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=442.0s)]
*  to wash something. You can't. You want to wash yourself. You can't. Even before October 7th, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=446.88s)]
*  I used to have to practice so carefully to only use one glove per patient because I couldn't [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=453.44s)]
*  afford to have gloves on both hands because we had a shortage of gloves. I used to wash my hands very [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=459.52s)]
*  carefully, use the smallest amount of soap because we didn't have soap. We didn't have hot water. We [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=465.6s)]
*  didn't have clean water. We had salinated water. And so it made it so that even our equipment, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=471.36s)]
*  for example, our autoclave was down more often than it was up. An autoclave is a piece of machinery [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=477.28000000000003s)]
*  that cleans and sterilizes other pieces of machinery or equipment. And that autoclave was down [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=483.12s)]
*  because, of course, we couldn't feed it clean water. We had to feed it dirty water. And that was [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=489.28000000000003s)]
*  always reflected. So what is happening is the tip of a sphere that has been thrust into the [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=494.32s)]
*  Palestinian heart for decades and decades. So I mentioned the medical equipment. Let's talk about [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=502.48s)]
*  some of the other pillars of medical health care. One other pillar of medical health care is the [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=509.76s)]
*  personnel. I've personally lost count of where we're at now. It's definitely over a thousand. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=514.64s)]
*  I think we're probably nearing 2,000 at the stage with what's happened over the last several weeks. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=521.36s)]
*  And this is just for the direct. Israel literally kills the person, not minding the indirect, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=527.6800000000001s)]
*  like the people who die from lots of other things. So we have the destruction of the equipment, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=533.92s)]
*  the banning of the entry of equipment. People who are going in, we have teams that are entering [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=542.24s)]
*  Gaza, they're getting searched. Where I wonder, the Israelis seem to be treating [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=548.08s)]
*  medical equipment and supplies like a normal border guard would treat, I don't know, a handgun [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=554.48s)]
*  or something like that. And they're searching them. When they catch them, they ban the organization. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=561.2800000000001s)]
*  If anybody had the temerity to try to smuggle in a piece of medical equipment, it's just totally, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=567.12s)]
*  totally depraved. And then of course, the third component. So we don't have the equipment, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=574.64s)]
*  we don't have the personnel. And then the third really important big piece is the place. You have [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=579.1999999999999s)]
*  to practice medicine somewhere. You can't practice medicine in a tent with dust going around, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=584.3199999999999s)]
*  no equipment and no protection for the patient in terms of temperature and humidity. It's raining [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=590.4s)]
*  all the time, all of that. And we're also seeing that every time the Palestinians incredibly, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=596.4s)]
*  in an almost like Sisyphean task, will put back together with whatever material they have, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=603.52s)]
*  a hospital, the Israelis are right there to destroy it. And this destruction, of course, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=610.0799999999999s)]
*  the Israelis used to pretend didn't happen, and then would just shrug their shoulders and justify. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=615.12s)]
*  And now with the destruction of the Turkish hospital, it is clear that the Israelis intend [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=620.4s)]
*  for everything in Gaza to be flocked, including of course, anything medical. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=627.12s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, just within the span of a few days, Israel blew up the remains of the Indonesia, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=635.52s)]
*  the Turkish Friendship Hospital, the only dedicated oncology center in Gaza that Israel had [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=644.4s)]
*  bombed in the first few months of the genocide already. And then it was turned into [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=651.6s)]
*  an Israeli military base, and then they left it and blew it up. And then they [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=656.32s)]
*  targeted the surgical ward at Nasser Medical Complex in Hanyunas. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=665.92s)]
*  What is it like right now for your colleagues trying to do the best they can, trying to do [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=675.28s)]
*  just the bare minimum in order to treat their patients while they are bracing for airstrikes [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=681.52s)]
*  on their clinics and on their surgical wards? I mean, what can you say about [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=692.3199999999999s)]
*  the conditions, like you said, like the conditions right now in Gaza are something [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=704.88s)]
*  Sisyphean. I mean, it's impossible. But what is like the day to day life like for some of your [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=710.24s)]
*  colleagues right now? Day to day life is impossible. I think we can all reflect on [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=720.4000000000001s)]
*  what they're going through and marvel, just absolutely marvel at the fact that they're [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=727.7600000000001s)]
*  able to survive. Yesterday, for example, there was a team member from GLIA was telling us, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=732.8s)]
*  oh my God, I was able to find a little bit of mackerel and eat it, this fish that was [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=739.52s)]
*  basically fresh. Everybody in Gaza right now has turned into a resistance fighter. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=745.5999999999999s)]
*  And I don't mean that in the armed sense. Going fishing is an act of absolutely, like absolute, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=752.64s)]
*  almost insane risk taking to basically fight for your own people to survive. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=760.64s)]
*  That mackerel costs people's lives. And every piece of food costs people's lives. The people [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=767.28s)]
*  who transport water are getting killed. The water trucks are being blown up. The people who [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=773.84s)]
*  work on the infrastructure are being killed. Israel is not considering anybody to be anything but [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=779.12s)]
*  a fighter. And I think Israel took this particular approach because they fully understand the [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=786.7199999999999s)]
*  Palestinians' will to the very last drop, fight for their own dignity and survival. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=792.4s)]
*  And just like your friend, Rafa Al-Arabir, had said, he would throw a marker. And Palestinians, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=798.16s)]
*  it's on the one hand so deeply inspiring that they're able to survive in this particular way. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=807.04s)]
*  On the other hand, when I talk to them, they are really hurting. They are deeply wounded. And [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=813.68s)]
*  they're wounded on multiple fronts. Of course, they have families that are now getting killed. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=818.8s)]
*  They have kids at home who they may never see again when they go to a shift. Everybody gives [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=824.3199999999999s)]
*  this hug. They call it like, like you greet somebody when you see them or when you part with [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=830.0s)]
*  them as though that's the last time ever. And everybody is on death row in Gaza. Every meal is [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=839.6s)]
*  their last meal if they can find food to have it. And the only thing is that part of the depravity [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=848.16s)]
*  is that the Israelis are so random about it. Nobody knows when that may happen. So they're on death [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=855.28s)]
*  row and they don't know when the warden will show up to take them and kill them. And that, of course, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=861.6s)]
*  that uncertainty is devastating. For example, after things started on March 18th, where the [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=868.16s)]
*  Israelis started murdering massive copious numbers of people again, the medical teams that were [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=873.6s)]
*  waiting to enter started to experience some of the psychological uncertainty. And we're talking [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=881.04s)]
*  about internationals who are coming from a place where they're well rested, well fed. And the [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=886.0799999999999s)]
*  uncertainty broke some of the medical team members they couldn't enter. Now, what, mind you, somebody [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=891.4399999999999s)]
*  who's been living that every single day for two years and there is no UN going to take them out [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=896.56s)]
*  in four weeks. So they are in a state of absolute psychological uncertainty. They're being tortured [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=901.52s)]
*  daily psychologically and physically because I think it qualifies when you starve somebody that's [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=908.4s)]
*  physical abuse. And at the same time, I can't believe how much they are able to accomplish, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=913.92s)]
*  how much they're able to do, how much they laugh and make jokes and maintain that spirit, because [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=922.96s)]
*  they understand first and foremost that the Israelis won't kill the nation of Palestine. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=931.9200000000001s)]
*  They can't. Only Palestinians can. And so long as it lives in them, then it lives. And I think that's [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=937.2s)]
*  something that the Israelis have started to really appreciate. And if I had to guess, you know, I'd [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=944.08s)]
*  guess that's one of the things that's making them, you know, extra mad. And so they throw their tantrums. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=950.0s)]
*  Eric, finally, can you talk about the work that your organization, the GLIA Project, has been able [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=960.08s)]
*  to do? You know, throughout the last 18 months, we've checked in with you and some of your [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=968.16s)]
*  colleagues about the projects, but especially in the last month after Israel sealed all the crossings [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=974.88s)]
*  into Gaza, no food, water, fuel, medical equipment, medications, you name it, anything. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=981.76s)]
*  How, what are, you know, what are you and your team members on the ground in Gaza [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=989.6s)]
*  able to do? What is, what does that look like even? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=999.44s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we are all now part of the resistance, whether we like it or not. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1005.4399999999999s)]
*  And of course, that resistance is led by Palestinians and led specifically by the armed [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1009.76s)]
*  factions that are resisting through, you know, armed resistance. However, right now, everybody [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1014.64s)]
*  who's trying to stop this genocide is in one way or the other part of the resistance. So what does [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1022.16s)]
*  it look like to be part of the resistance when you're a medical worker? Because frankly, I never [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1027.6s)]
*  thought as a doctor that I would be, you know, that's not, we always think of ourselves as being [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1032.24s)]
*  removed from conflict, as being removed from everything. And yet now, you know, our safe [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1037.04s)]
*  houses are being bombed, our people are being killed. I mean that in general, but the medical [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1041.92s)]
*  community, our hospitals are being destroyed, our equipment is being burned literally. And so what [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1046.08s)]
*  we realize is that the only way for us to treat our patients is full liberation for Palestine. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1052.56s)]
*  That's it. There is nothing else that is sufficient. Everything else is not even a band-aid. We're not [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1060.64s)]
*  even allowed to provide band-aids to Palestinians anymore. You know, we can't give them the most [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1067.2s)]
*  basic emergency treatment. And so it's made clear that the only thing that will help us deliver [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1072.96s)]
*  medical care is full liberation for Palestinians. So what does that look like on the ground? Well, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1078.88s)]
*  basically GLIA is involved any way that it can be to participate in helping Palestinians survive [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1084.24s)]
*  as they're doing and being in solidarity. So we don't call ourselves a medical aid organization, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1091.52s)]
*  call ourselves a solidarity organization. We're in medical solidarity. That's our specific branch. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1097.0400000000002s)]
*  We're still trying to make medical equipment. That's very, very difficult in the current [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1103.44s)]
*  environment, essentially impossible. It became somewhat possible during the ceasefire, but [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1106.96s)]
*  again, impossible now. And as well, we've been working with some water projects, providing water [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1113.52s)]
*  to people who need to drink because there is no health if there is no water. As well, we were [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1119.28s)]
*  running a clinic that actually was in the process of moving when the Israelis violated the ceasefire. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1125.28s)]
*  And so now what we're doing, well, totally blew up. I guess they were always in violation. But now [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1130.56s)]
*  we've had to pause that to figure out once the population flows calm a little bit, where are [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1137.6s)]
*  people so we can make sure that we're there to provide them with primary health care. That's our [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1142.48s)]
*  kind of specialty. Lots of other teams are better equipped to provide surgical health care for us. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1147.84s)]
*  Generally, we provide primary health care. Since we can't do that very well right now, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1153.44s)]
*  all of our staff are providing emergency relief. So that's in the emergency departments and things [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1157.3600000000001s)]
*  like that. And the other thing that we're trying to do as much as possible is work on the rebuilding. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1162.64s)]
*  Palestinians are rebuilding every moment. The moment the bomb falls and destroys something, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1170.0s)]
*  Palestinians are starting to rebuild. And we want to be a part of that as well. And so we have gotten [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1174.7199999999998s)]
*  very involved in day after plans, making sure that the rebuilding happens in a way that is [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1180.7199999999998s)]
*  respectful and dignified for Palestinians. So those are kinds of the main projects that we're [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1186.8s)]
*  working on right now. And I think an important part, a through line to all of that is our advocacy. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1192.3999999999999s)]
*  Which is why I think us and of course lots of other medical organizations are out there talking [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1199.76s)]
*  about what we see and what's happening so we can help move the needle politically. And hopefully [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1204.56s)]
*  through one step at a time and one little sort of political victory at a time, be able to make [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1209.84s)]
*  this genocide impossible. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1215.52s)]
*  And tell people how they can get in touch with GLIA and learn more about the work that you're doing. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1220.24s)]
*  GLIA is available really anywhere on social media if you are interested, if your viewers are [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1227.6000000000001s)]
*  interested in helping out. We need help in a few major ways. We're always looking for medical [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1232.72s)]
*  personnel to go into Gaza, including people who do logistics. So anyone who's willing to go for [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1237.8400000000001s)]
*  prolonged periods of time, please be in touch. We can talk and see how things go. The other thing [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1242.96s)]
*  is of course money. If people want to donate, there's some links to donate on our website. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1247.92s)]
*  And then the other most important thing, we do not want to be in the emergency medical [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1252.64s)]
*  relief business. We want to be in the chilling out and thinking how to make the world a better place [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1258.72s)]
*  while it's quiet outside and we have orange juice business. And to make that possible, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1264.72s)]
*  we really need for this genocide to stop. So everybody's doing amazing work. Your [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1269.2800000000002s)]
*  viewership is probably at the leading edge at the vanguard of that. And one thing that I want to say, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1274.8000000000002s)]
*  I've heard way too many of my friends feel disempowered and hopeless. We do not have the [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1280.16s)]
*  luxury of feeling disempowered and hopeless, especially when we are so capable. Everybody [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1287.3600000000001s)]
*  has a role to play and this is the time to pull up and do absolutely everything we can. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1292.64s)]
*  Thank you for that. Dr. Tarek Lubani, he's the medical director of the GLIA project at glia.org, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1299.52s)]
*  glia.org. And Tarek, thank you as always for everything you do and please come back soon to update. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1305.36s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1316.8799999999999s)]
*  you [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVy3us1ZQ4&t=1335.36s)]
