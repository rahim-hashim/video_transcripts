# How Hizballah aims to deter Israel, with Amal Saad | EI Podcast
**The Electronic Intifada:** [January 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik)
*  And it still hasn't achieved anything in military terms beyond ethnic cleansing and genocide. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=0.0s)]
*  It's very puzzling as to how they think that Hezbollah could be not even just defeated, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=15.36s)]
*  weakened to be frank. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=20.68s)]
*  I think it's impossible. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=21.88s)]
*  The electronic intifada. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  The electronic intifada. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=25.02s)]
*  The electronic intifada. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  The Electronic Interfada. This is the Electronic Interfada podcast. I'm Nora Barrow-Sweetman. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=27.38s)]
*  And I'm Asa Winstanley. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=34.58s)]
*  Welcome to the Electronic Interfada podcast. Now, since the Palestinian resistance in Gaza began [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=40.5s)]
*  what it calls Operation Al Aqsa Flood on the 7th of October, Israel has been carrying out a [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=47.7s)]
*  devastating genocidal war against the civilian population. And this has killed at least 23,000 [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=53.78s)]
*  people and counting. But Israel and its US and European backers have also been threatening to [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=61.620000000000005s)]
*  expand this war into a regional war, one which could stretch from occupied Palestine to Lebanon, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=66.9s)]
*  Syria, Yemen, and even possibly Iraq and Iran. And indeed, all these countries have been the target [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=73.06s)]
*  of US or Israeli bombing attacks since the 8th of October. But regional military powers have not [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=80.26s)]
*  been sitting on their hands. On the 8th of October, Hezbollah, the Lebanese resistance [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=87.54s)]
*  faction, joined the battle against Israel. And since then, they've been trading fire on the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=92.5s)]
*  northern border of occupied Palestine with the Israeli forces. We're very happy today to be joined [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=96.9s)]
*  by Amal Saad, a world-leading scholar of Hezbollah and the resistance axis. And she is a [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=102.9s)]
*  politics lecturer at Cardiff University in South Wales and was previously at Lebanese [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=109.94s)]
*  University in Beirut. She's the author of many things, but notably the book Hezbollah, Politics [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=115.14s)]
*  and Religion. Amal, thank you very much for joining us today. We know you're extremely busy, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=122.74s)]
*  so we're grateful that you found the time for this discussion. Thanks so much for having me. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=127.78s)]
*  Great. So we're going to talk later on in the podcast about the resistance axis and about [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=132.98s)]
*  the Western lefts, or we could say misconceptions among the Western left of Iran and its relations [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=140.01999999999998s)]
*  with Hezbollah. But first of all, let's start at the beginning for any viewers and listeners who [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=148.98s)]
*  might not know who are Hezbollah and why have they joined the Palestinian resistance's war against [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=154.42s)]
*  the Israeli military since the 8th of October? Well, Hezbollah are a military resistance movement [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=159.86s)]
*  on the one hand, and on the other hand, they're also a political party in Lebanon. Now they started [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=169.22000000000003s)]
*  off as a military movement in 1982 that was born as a result of Israel's invasion of Lebanon then, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=174.9s)]
*  and they very successfully resisted Israel over that time, and by 2000 Israel unilaterally withdrew [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=183.85999999999999s)]
*  from South Lebanon as a result of Hezbollah's military activity. And in 1992, they participated [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=190.82s)]
*  in parliamentary elections, the first of its kind after the civil war, and they've been participating [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=200.57999999999998s)]
*  after the civil war, and they've been participating since. And in 2005, they also joined the cabinet, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=206.34s)]
*  the government for the first time. So they've become also very sort of active players in the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=213.06s)]
*  political system, they're an entrenched part of the state, and they're the only group in Lebanon [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=218.98000000000002s)]
*  which has been allowed to retain its arms after the end of the civil war in order to continue to [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=224.82000000000002s)]
*  fight Israel and to act as a deterrent to Israel. Could you give us a bit of an overview of what [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=229.7s)]
*  the arm-wing of Hezbollah has been doing since the 8th of October against Israeli targets? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=238.33999999999997s)]
*  Right, so Hezbollah for the first time in its history has opened up the northern front [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=245.14s)]
*  fully on behalf of the Palestinians. In the past, they, you know, whenever that front was open, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=252.26s)]
*  it was for, you know, because of Lebanon. So this was the first time in their history they took the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=257.94s)]
*  initiative and launched cross-border strikes against Israel. Now they started off by targeting [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=264.42s)]
*  surveillance equipment, you know, watchtowers, etc. And they'd sort of blinded Israel in that sense, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=271.78s)]
*  so that it did serve a strategic purpose. They also targeted military bases and barracks, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=279.06s)]
*  and so progressively, you know, their targeting became more frequent, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=287.14s)]
*  it sort of increased in quantity and quality. They even, you know, fired at the Iron Dome several [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=291.14s)]
*  times. You know, they actually targeted the Iron Dome. So there have been different, they've taken [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=296.9s)]
*  down Israeli drones and they've hit Israeli settlements in response to Israel's targeting [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=302.97999999999996s)]
*  of Lebanese civilians. So the number of attacks or operations I think is around 700 now from October [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=309.3s)]
*  8. They've used quite sophisticated weaponry, I think. I mean, obviously, just a very small sample [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=317.06s)]
*  of their weapons arsenal, but they've used, you know, like the Burkhan missile, which has a heavy [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=323.46000000000004s)]
*  warhead. They've used precision-guided, anti-tank guided missiles. So they have increased also [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=328.74s)]
*  qualitatively in terms of the types of weapons they've been using and the targets and so on. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=335.94s)]
*  I've got a few bullet points here from one of Hassan Nasrallah's speeches of some of this stuff. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=341.3s)]
*  Hassan Nasrallah is, of course, the leader of Hezbollah, and he said in his 5th of January speech [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=349.78000000000003s)]
*  that there's been an average of six to seven military operations every day. 48 Israeli frontline [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=357.3s)]
*  posts have been hit, 50 targets behind the frontline, 17 settlements have been hit, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=367.3s)]
*  and he said the targets were tanks, armored vehicles, and also technological centers, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=376.02000000000004s)]
*  monitoring centers worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And there's been a kind of, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=382.02000000000004s)]
*  I guess you could say, a low-intensity war in the North? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=388.98s)]
*  I would say it's more than that. I think it's a misnomer when people say low-intensity war, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=392.98s)]
*  because low-intensity warfare usually involves sort of very guerrilla groups, first of all, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=398.5s)]
*  fighting against state actors, and they also involve sort of more basic, much more basic weapons [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=404.74s)]
*  like IEDs. They don't involve missiles and things like that. So the targets, the sort of targeting [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=413.06s)]
*  and weapons that Hezbollah has used, and the very fact that Hezbollah is not a regular guerrilla [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=419.46000000000004s)]
*  group, it's a hybrid force that I would say become even closer to a conventional armed force now than [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=423.86s)]
*  it was in 2006, and even then it was a regular force. So looking at these different types of [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=430.42s)]
*  force, so looking at these different indicators, I think it's more sort of apt to say it's a [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=437.78s)]
*  moderate-intensity war. It's not a high-intensity war yet. No, it's not like the war that [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=446.58s)]
*  Hamas and Islamic Jihad are fighting with Israel in Gaza. So it's a moderate-intensity war, yes. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=451.21999999999997s)]
*  And could you give an indication of the kinds of [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=457.38000000000005s)]
*  weaponry Hezbollah has, because it's more well armed than the Palestinian resistance, right? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=464.74s)]
*  Oh yes, I mean it's obviously much more sophisticated in terms of weapons, in terms of [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=475.3s)]
*  training, in terms of size, on all these different sort of levels. Hezbollah's a much more powerful [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=480.18s)]
*  military force than Hamas's. In fact, it's been called by many military experts as the most powerful [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=486.18s)]
*  non-state actor in the world, and there is a reason for that. Well, part of it is, as you say, the [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=492.34000000000003s)]
*  weapons. So Hezbollah possesses weapons. Obviously no one really has facts at their disposals quite [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=498.82s)]
*  hard, but just looking at different sort of reports, intelligence reports and others, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=504.5s)]
*  Hezbollah does seem to have a vast arsenal of, you know, it's reported 150,000 rockets and missiles, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=507.86s)]
*  and of those a large number are precision-guided, you know, it's got ballistic missiles, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=520.5s)]
*  it has, you know, anti-tank guided missiles that are sophisticated, it also has a vast array of [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=527.46s)]
*  drones, and you know drones have become sort of the weapon of the future, and we're seeing that [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=535.38s)]
*  now. So they have very sophisticated drones, long-range drones, medium-range, short-range, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=539.38s)]
*  you know kamikaze drones, other types, so that they've had these for a while now, and they've [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=544.74s)]
*  been using them effectively. They do have reportedly some air defense systems. I don't [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=549.46s)]
*  think they're very sophisticated, but they do seem to have, you know, some type of air defense. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=554.1s)]
*  Some say the SA-8, others say the SA-22, and you know this is what I've read so far. This is something [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=561.06s)]
*  very difficult to ascertain, because obviously Hezbollah doesn't disclose any information about [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=567.14s)]
*  their weapons. They have anti-ship missiles, they use them in the July war, but they have more [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=572.18s)]
*  sophisticated ones now, and so that's just looking at weapons, but what's more important I think is [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=577.06s)]
*  the sort of military experience Hezbollah has acquired over the years, and I'm not just talking [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=584.18s)]
*  about South Lebanon and how Hezbollah fared in 2006. It basically, you know, if we want to be [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=588.58s)]
*  conservative, we can say it prevented Israel or denied Israel a victory, and if you want to be [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=595.94s)]
*  more optimistic, you can say defeated Israel, but at the very, very minimum it denied Israel a victory, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=602.34s)]
*  and in fact Israel itself in the Wintergrad commission, the report that was issued there, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=608.5s)]
*  called it a failure on Israel's part. So we know that also Hezbollah has a lot of experience since [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=612.98s)]
*  then, including in Syria. It's fought in many different terrains, it's fought conventional [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=619.94s)]
*  armies, it's fought non-state actors, and you know like jihadi groups that have fought there, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=624.82s)]
*  it's fought in different terrains, in different weather conditions. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=630.82s)]
*  Okay, so that's great, I mean that's a good overview of what's been happening. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=635.14s)]
*  So as a little bit of context then, so the July 2006 war, you know, was a, I was actually living [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=643.0600000000001s)]
*  in the West Bank while that was happening, and it was a real eye-opener for me as someone coming [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=655.38s)]
*  from the West to see the level of support really among all sectors. I mean I was living in, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=663.3000000000001s)]
*  I was living in Ramallah in what was called the old city of Ramallah, it's not really that old, but [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=672.58s)]
*  it's, basically there was a lot of Christians living, there's a lot of Christians, and because [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=679.86s)]
*  Ramallah was originally a small Christian village which kind of blossomed out, boomed out during the [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=684.82s)]
*  Palestinian Authority years, but this is to say that, you know, there was, you know, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=692.82s)]
*  a lot of Christians living in that area, and yet everyone was still supporting Hezbollah during that [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=700.5s)]
*  period, and I remember, I've probably got a photo of it somewhere, there was a Christian bakery which [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=707.6999999999999s)]
*  always had an icon of Mary outside it, and then during the Hezbollah war they put up a poster of [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=713.38s)]
*  Hassan Nasrallah during the war, the Israeli war against Lebanon in 2006, and that was just, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=723.7s)]
*  that was to me, that was such a sort of, that's something I always remember because it was like, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=733.0600000000001s)]
*  that was emblematic to me of how really everyone was supporting Hezbollah, whereas to me as someone [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=739.86s)]
*  coming from the West, Hezbollah was always mis-betrayed as this terrorist group in Western [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=745.46s)]
*  media, but could you talk a little bit about, obviously, you know, people can read your book [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=752.18s)]
*  to get into the full history, we're not going to have time to get into the full history, but could [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=759.6999999999999s)]
*  you talk a little bit about the reason for the emergence of Hezbollah in terms of the Israeli [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=762.5s)]
*  occupation of South Lebanon in the 80s? I mean, Hezbollah has, I'm not going to exaggerate and [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=770.3399999999999s)]
*  say it enjoys, you know, full popular legitimacy, it doesn't, no group does, not even the Lebanese [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=777.14s)]
*  state enjoys that legitimacy, unfortunately, but, and Nasrallah has repeatedly said that Hezbollah, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=784.26s)]
*  its armed status, does not enjoy a national consensus, and Lebanon is a deeply polarized [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=791.14s)]
*  society, different sects and parties have different foreign allegiances, you know, that are [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=796.74s)]
*  complete in complete contradiction with one another, you know, you've got US-backed groups, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=804.82s)]
*  Saudi-backed groups, you know, groups that are supported by Iran, so, and some in the past by [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=808.6600000000001s)]
*  Syria, Syria is much less powerful now, of course, so that there are these sort of competing foreign [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=813.38s)]
*  allegiances, so it's very hard for Hezbollah to enjoy full popular legitimacy in terms of its [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=819.62s)]
*  armed presence, but what happened particularly after 2005, after the Hariri assassination, when [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=825.46s)]
*  Lebanon became divided between, you know, March 14 forces and March 8 forces was that it was able [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=832.02s)]
*  to not only rally all the Shia of Lebanon behind it, who make up about a third of the population, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=840.5799999999999s)]
*  virtually all according to opinion polls, according to election results, you know, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=846.18s)]
*  I think around 95% of Lebanese Shia support Hezbollah, and they've also been able to rally some [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=850.74s)]
*  Sunnis behind them, and this was a bit difficult in 2005, right before the July War, because there [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=857.94s)]
*  were so many sort of sectarian tensions in the aftermath of the Hariri assassination, and in the [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=863.5400000000001s)]
*  aftermath of the US invasion of Iraq, so over the years it managed to, I think, you know, rally other [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=868.0200000000001s)]
*  groups behind it, and especially the Christians, so the Christians under the leadership of the [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=875.3000000000001s)]
*  former president Michel Aoun, who had headed the free patriotic movement, at the time they were much [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=879.46s)]
*  bigger than they are now, and so, you know, we could say Hezbollah enjoyed maybe, you know, a very, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=886.82s)]
*  I don't want to say half, but a very large segment of the Christian population as well, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=892.82s)]
*  and you would see, like in a lot of the Hezbollah rallies, you would find many Christians who [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=897.0600000000001s)]
*  attended those rallies, so it did have some cross-sectarian support, now that support, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=901.46s)]
*  obviously, during the July War it peaked, because at wartime, usually when any group resists Israel, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=908.5s)]
*  you know, this is this case for Hamas today, you can look at the figures, like before the invasion, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=915.54s)]
*  and during the invasion, they skyrocket, so most Lebanese, even sort of more right-wing Christian [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=919.94s)]
*  groups, a lot of them also as well rallied behind Hezbollah, a majority of Sunnis rallied behind [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=925.7s)]
*  Hezbollah, this was 2006, when sectarian tensions were at their peak, now since then there's been, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=931.14s)]
*  you know, thankfully a desectarianization in Lebanon, we've got much less sort of sectarian [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=938.5s)]
*  tensions than we did in the past, I'm talking like the last two, three years this has been the case, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=943.22s)]
*  and today in fact, you know, looking at sort of public opinion in Lebanon, it's clear that the [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=949.7s)]
*  overwhelming majority of Sunnis support Hamas and Islamic Jihad, you know, they support the [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=955.3000000000001s)]
*  Palestinian cause, obviously the overwhelming majority, over 95% of Shia do as well, the Druze [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=960.74s)]
*  do as well, you know, the Muslim sect, they support the Palestinian cause, so I think it would be [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=966.1s)]
*  logical to expect these other sects to transfer that sort of support to Hezbollah if Israel attacked [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=971.22s)]
*  Lebanon, and obviously many Christians support as well, I left out the Christian community, so [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=979.14s)]
*  you know, it's still hard to gauge exactly, you know, in terms of percentages and figures, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=984.98s)]
*  but I think the overwhelming majority of Lebanese, you know, would support Hezbollah in any war with [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=989.3000000000001s)]
*  Israel, so it wouldn't, I don't think one can count on sort of, like many sort of Western observers [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=994.98s)]
*  believe that, or Israelis say, that Hezbollah is constrained by internal considerations that it [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1001.54s)]
*  wouldn't win public support, well even if it doesn't have that now, which is also questionable, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1007.0600000000001s)]
*  I think they do have a majority support currently for their activities along the border, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1011.46s)]
*  they would definitely have over 75% support, and I say that figure because that was the figure, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1017.62s)]
*  around that figure in 2006, so it's a much less hostile environment for Hezbollah, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1022.1s)]
*  the government itself is not an anti-Hezbollah government as was the 2006 government, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1027.8600000000001s)]
*  which was led by the Prime Minister Fouad Sanouar, who according to WikiLeaks was actually [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1034.58s)]
*  conspiring with Israel against Hezbollah, as were many March 14 politicians calling on the US to [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1038.9s)]
*  push Israel to destroy Hezbollah, destroy South Lebanon, so we do not have such a government in [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1044.58s)]
*  place today. Let's bring it up a bit more up to date then, and let's talk about the killing of [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1049.54s)]
*  Salah Haruri. Salah Haruri was Hamas's deputy political leader, and he said in a phone interview [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1056.34s)]
*  with Al Jazeera on the 12th of October that the 7th of October assault was what he called a [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1066.58s)]
*  pre-emptive strike against an upcoming Israeli attack, and that it caused chaos amongst Israeli [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1071.78s)]
*  occupation forces, but Haruri was also involved in Hamas's indirect negotiations with Israel [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1079.06s)]
*  over the prisoner swaps that Hamas is proposing between the Palestinian resistance and Israel. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1087.14s)]
*  Now Haruri and several others were killed in what was an apparent Israeli drone strike targeting [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1096.9s)]
*  a southern Beirut suburb on the 2nd of January, so last week as we're filming this. Israel's [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1104.1s)]
*  former UN ambassador Danny Danon posted on ex-formerly Twitter saying that the bombing was [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1115.3799999999999s)]
*  carried out by the Israeli military, the Shin Bet, the Mossad and the security sources. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1121.7s)]
*  In this tweet he thanked them for that. Now there was no official confirmation of this claim. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1128.42s)]
*  The Israeli spokesperson Mark Regev even claimed that it wasn't an attack on Lebanon as a state, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1136.3400000000001s)]
*  and that he said something along the lines of whoever did it they had beef with Hamas. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1143.54s)]
*  Now do you think this sort of coyness to claim responsibility for this attack was [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1149.38s)]
*  directly by the Israeli representatives? Do you think that was a sign that Israel is [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1157.14s)]
*  worried about a serious response from Hezbollah? It was pretty easy to be honest, they didn't [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1163.22s)]
*  really make much of an effort to hide, there's very little plausible deniability in that, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1170.58s)]
*  and Mark Regev made a mistake on TV where he said Israel, if you recall, so I don't think they made [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1177.0600000000002s)]
*  much effort to conceal that, but nonetheless yes, well their policy has historically been to not [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1183.7s)]
*  claim responsibility immediately, we only find out years later in memoirs and so on, you know, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1191.0600000000002s)]
*  of their role in these targeted assassinations, but I do think Israel was concerned about Hezbollah's [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1196.5s)]
*  response, I mean that's if we want to be kind of sanguine about this and say Israel didn't try [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1202.74s)]
*  and provoke Hezbollah into a wider war, so if we look at it in terms of it really was just a target, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1207.3s)]
*  and I think it was mainly because if they did want to provoke Hezbollah into a war they would have [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1215.46s)]
*  picked a different target because it wasn't a Hezbollah target, it was a Hamas target, and yes of [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1220.1s)]
*  course it violated the rules of engagement, Nasrallah's red line which he had warned back [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1225.3s)]
*  in August that if Israel does try and assassinate any leader from any group in Lebanon, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1230.98s)]
*  you know, on Lebanese soil that Hezbollah would not tolerate it, so you know there clearly was [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1238.74s)]
*  an expectation of a retaliation, but you know again here I'm not really sure, I don't think anyone [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1244.34s)]
*  knows whether Israel did want to kind of drag Hezbollah into a war with this or whether it was [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1251.54s)]
*  banking on Hezbollah sort of remaining cautious, and I tend to believe the latter in this specific [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1256.42s)]
*  case, that Israel kind of knew that Hezbollah doesn't want war and wouldn't escalate to the [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1261.0600000000002s)]
*  point that it would bring sort of the conflict to the brink of war. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1267.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you posted on ex, formerly Twitter, after the assassination this writing that Hezbollah will [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1274.18s)]
*  likely quote, will likely retaliate in a manner that is at once an escalation that matches the [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1282.5s)]
*  scope of the Israeli assassination and restores the balance of deterrence, but also one which [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1289.54s)]
*  remains at a sub-threshold level, i.e. short of all-out war, end of quote. It seems that you [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1295.54s)]
*  have proven right on Saturday as the sixth, as we're filming this, when Hezbollah launched [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1302.98s)]
*  dozens of rockets at the Miron airbase in northern occupied Palestine, and we've got [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1310.42s)]
*  this video that we're showing is an official video of the armed wing of Hezbollah that they put out, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1319.7s)]
*  showing this 3D map of the airbase along with actual footage of the attack, and they caused [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1328.3400000000001s)]
*  significant damage, and then soon after that there was an explosive drone strike on another [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1338.18s)]
*  Israeli military base in Safad, which is deep into northern occupied Palestine, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1346.18s)]
*  further than they, I believe these two targets were both further than they previously hit? [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1352.5800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, they were the first, I think was eight kilometers and the second was 12 or 13 kilometers. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1358.5800000000002s)]
*  So the question for you then is that did these targets represent a significant escalation along [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1364.26s)]
*  the lines that you predicted in that tweet? Oh, I believe so, because Israel responded by [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1372.5s)]
*  assassinating Hezbollah officials right after that, whom they connected to both these strikes. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1377.62s)]
*  So Israel responded to the Miron strike by assassinating a senior commander, reportedly [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1382.98s)]
*  number two in the Hezbollah's Ridwan unit, its elite force, and then Hezbollah retaliated [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1392.0200000000002s)]
*  for both his assassination and for al-Haroudi, so it was a double kind of response for both, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1400.1000000000001s)]
*  with the attack on Safad base, and then Israel the same day responded by assassinating someone [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1406.5s)]
*  they claimed, and I don't think that's accurate because Hezbollah did not actually deny that he [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1415.3000000000002s)]
*  was the head of the drone unit, but Israel claimed he was the head of the drone unit, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1421.22s)]
*  which was responsible for striking Safad, and when it retaliated by assassinating [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1426.82s)]
*  Wissam al-Tawil, Israel, and it claimed that he was responsible for the Miron attack, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1434.5s)]
*  so that does show us that Israel did understand this to be a retaliation as it should, because [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1440.66s)]
*  it was qualitatively different in terms of not just depth of incursion, but in terms of very [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1445.7s)]
*  strategic type of target that Hezbollah was able to strike, and it had not done that before, I mean [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1451.94s)]
*  they had sort of hit military bases and barracks, but obviously nothing of the scope, that doesn't [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1458.82s)]
*  tell us exactly how much damage they did, especially in the second instance, we don't [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1464.3400000000001s)]
*  really know, and Israel is very tight-lipped about casualties, about the extent of damage, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1467.7s)]
*  and so on, so it's going to be quite difficult to tell how effective those strikes were, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1473.06s)]
*  but what we can look at is, have they deterred Israel? We don't know yet, will it continue with [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1477.7s)]
*  its strategy of assassinations? It very well might do, it obviously hasn't stopped because [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1484.74s)]
*  it's been, but these two military figures that it did target, I think it is important to [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1491.22s)]
*  distinguish them from the al-Aruri strike, which was much more provocative because it happened in [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1497.1399999999999s)]
*  Beirut, because it was outside the combat zone, so that was really an abandonment of the rules of [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1501.38s)]
*  engagement. These other two, I'm not saying that they weren't important targets or that it wasn't [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1507.7s)]
*  provocative, but nonetheless they happened sort of on the southern front, close to the border area, [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1513.94s)]
*  they were combatants, so it's not the same, I don't think we can say they're anywhere near [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1519.0600000000002s)]
*  as provocative or a sharp hit to deterrence as the al-Aruri strike was. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1524.82s)]
*  So let's go back a little bit to the beginning, when Sayyid Hassan Nasrallah made his debut speech [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1531.54s)]
*  in November since the beginning of Israel's genocide in Gaza, you wrote that, in the following [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1541.78s)]
*  days you wrote that many people seem to have viewed Nasrallah's speech as a sign of de-escalation, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1549.54s)]
*  I disagree, and then you said that the speech was addressed to the US first and Israel second, [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1555.3799999999999s)]
*  and that Hezbollah is in fact ready to go to war with both. When, I mean Hezbollah has made, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1562.82s)]
*  excuse me, Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah has made a series of speeches since then, and where he [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1569.54s)]
*  talked a great deal about Israel's attacks in the Gaza Strip, where he talked about the Palestinian [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1574.4199999999998s)]
*  resistance, there was a lot of, he gave a lot of ownership to Hamas's military operation on October [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1582.34s)]
*  7th to the Palestinian resistance, there was a clear kind of distance that some may have interpreted [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1592.1799999999998s)]
*  as kind of a distance, I'd like you to address that, I want you to talk about the most significant [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1599.54s)]
*  points he made, what your reading is of that interpretation, and maybe perhaps even address [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1606.9s)]
*  that, you know, in the aftermath of that speech there were some people who viewed it as kind of a [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1614.42s)]
*  de-escalation, as falling short of like an announcement of an all-out war against Israel [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1622.5s)]
*  in defense of Palestinians, others have maybe correctly interpreted it as, you know, a sign of [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1630.26s)]
*  the level-headedness and the cool-headedness that we've always seen from the Lebanese resistance, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1641.22s)]
*  so can you explain why he didn't announce an all-out war, perhaps in reference to Hezbollah's [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1648.82s)]
*  doctrine of what some have referred to as the escalation ladder? Yeah, well I'm going to sort [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1655.78s)]
*  of conflate here a bit the first and second speeches that he made because they, you know, [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1662.26s)]
*  one built on the other and so I'm just going to treat them both as sort of the same speech, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1666.66s)]
*  you know, in that speech I think I recall a lot of people, a lot of supporters of the Palestinian [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1672.74s)]
*  cause were very disappointed because they wanted Nasserullah to declare all-out war on Israel, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1677.3799999999999s)]
*  and as someone who's been observing Hezbollah for decades now, I thought the very fact that Hezbollah [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1682.42s)]
*  was engaged in moderate intensity war was huge in itself and I did not expect Hezbollah to launch [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1687.3s)]
*  all-out war and if they were going to they were not going to declare it because generally speaking [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1693.94s)]
*  it's not just Hezbollah that doesn't do that, no army in the world does that, no army in the world [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1697.62s)]
*  that actually has a real plan to initiate a war, you know, in that sense is going to declare its [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1701.94s)]
*  aims and, you know, take away the element of surprise so I would have been shocked if Nasserullah [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1709.54s)]
*  did that and especially someone like him who's not given to bombast or bluster or anything like that [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1714.5s)]
*  and that's why Israel takes him very seriously in fact and his, you know, his speeches are so eagerly [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1720.02s)]
*  awaited all over the world and particularly in Israel because they tend to believe what he says [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1725.06s)]
*  unlike many other Arab leaders, so I think that speech was not a de-escalation, you know, as you [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1730.6599999999999s)]
*  noted, as I wrote on Twitter, it was just a very kind of carefully worded, I would say, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1737.7s)]
*  threat or warning that Hezbollah could escalate if Israel continues to, and he said there were two [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1747.3s)]
*  developments it would observe, one would be how it sort of responds to Lebanon, how it deals with the [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1755.78s)]
*  Lebanese front and that's in terms of Lebanon's national security and the other was with regard [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1760.98s)]
*  to Palestine, with regard to the Palestinian people in terms of genocide and ethnic cleansing, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1767.22s)]
*  I mean he didn't go into detail but that's what I understood and in terms of sort of the [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1772.02s)]
*  fate of Hamas, like if Hamas was going to be significantly weakened and by that I presume [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1779.3000000000002s)]
*  we mean, you know, like decapitating its leadership, weakening it militarily, etc. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1785.38s)]
*  and those are the conditions under which Hezbollah would then sort of be forced to go [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1790.9s)]
*  and launch an all-out war, so you know it's not as if he didn't say there was a scenario under which [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1796.18s)]
*  we wouldn't go to war, he was saying right now we're going to be doing this sort of level of [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1803.14s)]
*  warfare, it's this, and I think he did describe it as kind of a moderate intensity because he [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1808.74s)]
*  recounted the different attacks they've been staging so far and what they've been hit and how [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1814.0200000000002s)]
*  they've been able to divert so much of the air force, naval forces and ground forces away from [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1819.14s)]
*  Gaza by opening up the northern front, so he explained in terms of military strategy how [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1825.5400000000002s)]
*  important that was and that although it's maybe, you know, Israel has basically destroyed all of [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1830.66s)]
*  Gaza but I think that, you know, the insinuation there was that they may have been more successful [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1838.1000000000001s)]
*  had Hezbollah not diverted them, so in terms of targeting Hamas I mean. Also in the first speech [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1844.34s)]
*  I think it was really important that he highlighted the role of the US and that's why, you know, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1851.1399999999999s)]
*  that one understood from this that Hezbollah is aware that if there is an all-out war, if there [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1856.74s)]
*  is a full-blown conflict, that the US would be an active co-belligerent in it and that Hezbollah was [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1861.3s)]
*  fully ready to take on not just Israel but the US as well and that the US was in fact kind of the [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1866.4199999999998s)]
*  main architect of this war in the sense that although the Israeli, you know, government wanted [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1872.5s)]
*  a war but that they wouldn't be able to get one without US support and so it was, you know, the [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1878.34s)]
*  fact that Nasrallah was threatening the US, he was actually threatening the US and saying, you know, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1886.02s)]
*  we are more than ready for this and as our allies across the region, so, you know, I think those were [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1891.54s)]
*  the main points of that speech and since then he's, you know, he's had other speeches and it's all [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1897.46s)]
*  sort of built on this and it's been a continuation. He's also going to speak on Sunday so that's [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1901.94s)]
*  something we also have to look out for, yeah. You wrote an article for the Electronic Interfader [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1907.8600000000001s)]
*  15 years ago, 15 years ago to the day actually that we're filming this and I want to look back [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1920.42s)]
*  on that a little bit and see if you were right or wrong. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1930.02s)]
*  Yeah, a few quotes from it. While Israel fervently attempts to terrorise the Palestinians into [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1938.66s)]
*  submission in Gaza, many observers have started to wonder why Hezbollah has refrained from stepping [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1945.06s)]
*  in militarily to assist its brothers in arms, Hamas. Such musings fail to take account of the [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1952.42s)]
*  constraints on Hezbollah's room for action as well as the circumstances under which Hezbollah [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1958.5s)]
*  would ignore such constraints. The question that should be posed is not so much if Hezbollah will [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1964.34s)]
*  act but when. Now you were writing this during, you were writing this Amal, during the 2008 [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1970.02s)]
*  slash 2009 Israeli war against the Gaza Strip but I mean that quote in particular you could have [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1978.02s)]
*  been writing today really I think, fortunately and unfortunately. Yes, it's sad when one is [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1985.22s)]
*  right about something like this isn't it? Yeah, yeah I mean it's kind of a sign of how [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=1992.34s)]
*  little has changed in some ways but of course things have changed in some other ways. To read [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2000.5s)]
*  another quote from this article, quote, more than simply receiving military training, Hamas's [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2007.06s)]
*  military strategy appears to conform to the new school of fighting founded by Hezbollah's [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2016.5s)]
*  assassinated military leader Imad Mughnea himself rumoured to have personally trained and equipped [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2025.1399999999999s)]
*  several Palestinian groups over the years which combines conventional and non-conventional guerrilla [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2031.94s)]
*  warfare that functions not only to liberate occupied territory but to defend itself from [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2038.18s)]
*  aggression end of quote. Yeah I mean, Amal you've seen the, I'm sure you've seen the videos that [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2044.5800000000002s)]
*  have been coming out from the Palestinian resistance in Gaza. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2053.38s)]
*  Do you think the Palestinian resistance, the way that it's fighting in Gaza to defend itself [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2059.46s)]
*  against the Israeli invading Israeli soldiers, do you think these guerrilla tactics that they've [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2067.7000000000003s)]
*  been using bear the signs of this kind of training? Oh definitely and this was evident [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2073.1400000000003s)]
*  you know way back, I think anyone who's been observing Hamas's military skills over the [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2082.26s)]
*  years will see that a lot of their you know sort of military tactics, weapons and so on were very [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2088.42s)]
*  similar to Hezbollah's in the 2000s and so for example the bunker network, it's a very, I think [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2097.6200000000003s)]
*  over 400 kilometers that Hamas has. I mean Hezbollah did not fight a bunker, we'll mind you, in 2006 [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2104.1800000000003s)]
*  like Hamas, that it used bunkers but not in the same way that Hamas has been forced to use them. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2109.38s)]
*  It's a very different terrain and you know like in Lebanon Hezbollah had what they called nature [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2114.26s)]
*  reserves, what Israel called nature reserves, you know Hezbollah was able to conceal weapons and so [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2118.5s)]
*  on in mountainous areas and so on so they didn't really need to rely as extensively on bunkers as [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2123.7000000000003s)]
*  Hamas does but nonetheless the bunker, the very you know the way these bunkers are built [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2128.58s)]
*  you know from what I know that Hezbollah played a very important role in this and specifically [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2135.2200000000003s)]
*  Ahmad Mughni had a hand in this and we saw the first signs of these bunkers in the 2008-2009 war [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2139.38s)]
*  and we know that Hamas has been trained as has Islamic shahad by Hezbollah directly [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2146.34s)]
*  and in terms of also weapons manufacturing and so on. I mean Hamas has to rely a lot more on [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2152.82s)]
*  manufacturing their own weapons than Hezbollah does because of supply route difficulties that [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2157.78s)]
*  Hamas faces that Hezbollah doesn't face so that they definitely played a very active role in [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2162.26s)]
*  strengthening Hamas's military capabilities as has of course Iran and Syria in the past. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2170.9s)]
*  Yes, yeah so just to clarify for our viewers and listeners of the supply route difficulties that [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2176.5s)]
*  you mentioned, Hezbollah, Lebanon of course borders Syria which in turn borders Iran and Iran is a [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2183.7s)]
*  supporter of the Lebanese resistance and so weapons can be transferred that way because [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2196.02s)]
*  Syria is also of course a member of this axis of resistance which we're going to talk a little bit [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2202.8199999999997s)]
*  more about in a bit but that's a form of support that the Palestinian resistance [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2209.14s)]
*  doesn't have in the same way, of course it doesn't have a border with Syria, Lebanon or Iran [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2216.74s)]
*  in that way and it is isolated, it only has a border with Egypt but we're not going to get into that. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2225.06s)]
*  Hezbollah tried in the past to smuggle weapons into Gaza from Egypt but Egypt arrested its [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2233.78s)]
*  operative who was doing the smuggling so it's really difficult because the Rafah crossing was [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2241.38s)]
*  the only place or border through which Palestinian groups could receive weapons [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2246.6600000000003s)]
*  so it's just to give you an idea about how difficult it is, it's much more difficult than [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2254.1000000000004s)]
*  it has been for Hezbollah which relies on Syria as a supply route. Yeah that's fascinating, I mean [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2258.1s)]
*  the Palestinian resistance in Gaza obviously faces these sort of geographical limitations, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2266.58s)]
*  structural limitations in the same way that the Lebanese resistance [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2275.86s)]
*  doesn't and it seems that, again we don't have any inside information here but going from what we [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2279.62s)]
*  can see in terms of videos and publicly available information, it seems that Hamas and Islam [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2288.7400000000002s)]
*  Jihad and the others, Palestinian resistance factions, rely on domestically manufactured weapons. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2295.94s)]
*  Which is why it's so absurd that Israel would even think of taking on Hezbollah because [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2303.3s)]
*  if it hasn't been able to score a single military victory of any significance against Hamas which [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2308.18s)]
*  has been making its own drones, using commercial drones and homemade weapons and it still [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2313.7799999999997s)]
*  hasn't achieved anything in military terms beyond ethnic cleansing and genocide, it's very puzzling [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2321.22s)]
*  as to how they think that even the US frankly, not just Israel, even if the US participated in [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2327.8599999999997s)]
*  the war, I don't see how they would assume that Hezbollah could be not even just defeated, weakened [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2333.46s)]
*  to be frank, I think it's impossible. Yeah fascinating, okay there's a couple more quotes [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2338.9s)]
*  here from your article. The reason then for Hezbollah's constructive ambiguity whereby [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2348.5s)]
*  it neither confirms nor denies its attempt to join the conflict is clear, although the resistance has [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2357.46s)]
*  so far remained on the sidelines of the conflict, it's highly improbable that it would continue to [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2362.74s)]
*  do so if Hamas are on the verge of collapse. Yeah again, interesting parallels because [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2367.7s)]
*  you know you're making the same analysis today of that it's unlikely that Hezbollah would [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2376.74s)]
*  continue to keep the same level of its involvement, that it wouldn't escalate its involvement if [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2384.18s)]
*  Hamas's military wing were on the verge of collapse and as you just stated it's not, [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2391.22s)]
*  like there's been no significant, there's been no real military achievements by the Israeli military [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2398.8199999999997s)]
*  against Hamas, you know we've seen, you know they've just, they said not long ago that they [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2406.18s)]
*  have dismantled, they made this ridiculous claim that they've dismantled Hamas and its military [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2412.8999999999996s)]
*  infrastructure in the north of Gaza and then you know immediately after Hamas puts out more [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2419.06s)]
*  videos showing that that's just completely untrue. I'm also curious about this idea of constructive [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2425.2999999999997s)]
*  ambiguity, I mean if you could talk about that because that seems to be the mystery of [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2433.14s)]
*  the ambiguity of the Lebanese resistance's supposed, not intentions but the extent that [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2441.2999999999997s)]
*  they're willing to go creates a lot of anxiety in Israel and I'm very curious about this interpretation [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2452.98s)]
*  which you can see both in their discourse and in their actions and if you could talk about that. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2463.14s)]
*  Did I use the word constructive ambiguity? Did I actually? [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2469.78s)]
*  Sulla used it in his speech, I think it was the first or the second speech [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2473.86s)]
*  and I'm wondering did he, did I put it in quotations? [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2478.58s)]
*  I don't think you did. No, so it wasn't a not so much. No you're just a, okay. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2482.42s)]
*  Because I'm trying to, did he use this term? No it's your, there's no quotes, it's your turn. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2489.78s)]
*  He's only used it recently for the first time in regard to the strategy. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2494.98s)]
*  Oh wow. Yeah I just realised that, I thought I was quoting him when you read it. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2499.14s)]
*  Well you may have been quoted him but if so then there's no indication you were. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2504.42s)]
*  I think it's interesting because as you say it does function as a form of psychological warfare [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2513.3s)]
*  and what's interesting about Hezbollah's psychological warfare, so you know in [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2519.22s)]
*  propaganda you've got you know white propaganda and grey and black and you know they all have [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2523.06s)]
*  different elements of lies or untruths and so with white propaganda it's just objective facts and I [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2528.02s)]
*  think Israel does see, does view Nasrallah's psychological warfare as sort of constituting [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2534.2599999999998s)]
*  white propaganda because he doesn't lie actually, he just withholds a lot of truth, he withholds a [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2539.7s)]
*  lot of information but he doesn't actually state lies so he prefers to say very little [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2545.2999999999997s)]
*  and that's been very effective and I found it most effective myself because in the, you know [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2551.86s)]
*  his speech, the one in which he was supposed to threaten, the one before last right after al-Aruri, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2557.62s)]
*  the assassination, he just left it till the very end, it was quite tantalising because we were all [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2565.38s)]
*  waiting for him to say something and he did it until the very end of the speech and he just said [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2570.5s)]
*  like one sentence like this is not going to go unpunished and he just smiled and I believe that [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2575.38s)]
*  even the smile was you know by design, it was designed to cause that kind of anxiety and you [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2579.7s)]
*  know uncertainty in Israel so there was this fear you know after his speech the Israelis were [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2589.62s)]
*  saying that you know they were preparing the northern front for all contingencies and even [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2596.58s)]
*  Tel Aviv and so on, I think he's quite adept at this form of warfare and this constructive ambiguity [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2601.62s)]
*  you know Hezbollah as I said most armies in the world, most leaders will not disclose their [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2612.74s)]
*  military plans in advance, I don't think this is unique to Hezbollah but I think what is unique is [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2617.62s)]
*  the way Hezbollah conducts its psychological warfare does seem to be effective because Israel [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2622.5s)]
*  always sort of responds to that quite immediately and we can see the effects of that and the fact [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2628.1s)]
*  that Hezbollah doesn't actually lie when it does make these threats so yeah I think that's [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2633.7s)]
*  that's something to look out for in all of his speeches, it's what makes them effective, the lack of [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2639.94s)]
*  of you know lying. Yeah, before tomorrow is going to take us on to move us on to the access of [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2645.7799999999997s)]
*  resistance but before we do that just I just want to point out that Hezbollah, like what Hezbollah [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2652.42s)]
*  has done since the 8th of October is really, I mean it's really significant you know people [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2660.58s)]
*  you know as Tamara mentioned earlier some people may be posting online that I saw and as you [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2668.34s)]
*  mentioned as well may be a bit disappointed some some sort of pro-resistance people maybe [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2675.14s)]
*  want to see Hezbollah doing more on people saying things like that but if we look objectively at [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2681.94s)]
*  what has been achieved I mean just you mentioned the sort of [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2688.82s)]
*  propaganda war in a way being carried out by Nasrallah, there has been these just regular [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2696.82s)]
*  attacks on the north of occupied Palestine, there's been certainly tens of thousands and possibly [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2702.98s)]
*  as many as 200 or so thousand Israeli settlers who have been displaced from the north of occupied [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2711.38s)]
*  Palestine and you know this I mean that I think Hezbollah in one of his speeches [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2718.26s)]
*  actually in one of his recent speeches mentioned some of this and he said that [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2725.1400000000003s)]
*  he said something along the lines of that yeah actually I've got the quote here said previously [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2729.2200000000003s)]
*  any one of our operations that we've done recently would have resulted in Israel bombing Beirut and [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2734.9s)]
*  destroying neighborhoods yeah yeah that's true I mean it's it he also mentioned in that speech [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2741.06s)]
*  something that a lot of people hadn't sort of taken note of which was this was unprecedented [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2748.2599999999998s)]
*  Hezbollah has never taken sort of the military initiative yes in 2006 it did abduct Israeli [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2752.58s)]
*  soldiers but that wasn't the same sort of opening up a front and Hezbollah was involved in a sort [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2758.58s)]
*  of low intensity warfare you know over the years with Israel but this is very different because [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2764.58s)]
*  the front had been you know relative very quiet I would say with the exception of Israeli you know [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2770.8199999999997s)]
*  sort of violations here and there and they have happened over the years but it was relatively calm [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2776.1s)]
*  and Hezbollah just opened this front and that was something that was actually you know this was [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2782.02s)]
*  offensive warfare effectively this was an offensive tactic the strategy's defense is offensive defense [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2787.3799999999997s)]
*  but it is actually initiating a war much like Hamas's October 7 attack was offensive as well [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2793.7799999999997s)]
*  in that sense but they initiated an attack so I think that is something one has to factor in that [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2799.86s)]
*  is qualitatively different from Hezbollah like the 2009 invasion we talked about when Hezbollah [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2807.06s)]
*  did no such thing so that there is a huge shift I think in terms of strategy and I do think [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2812.1s)]
*  although you pointed out Tamara earlier that Nasrallah sort of emphasized Palestinian ownership [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2818.6600000000003s)]
*  of this attack and I think that's an important point and that is something that Hezbollah has [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2824.82s)]
*  always been very careful in terms of because Palestine is not just an Arab and an Islamic cause [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2828.66s)]
*  but also a national cause for Palestinians and that they are at the spearhead of their cause and [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2834.8999999999996s)]
*  that no one can come and sort of decenter them and take center stage so Hezbollah has always been very [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2839.8599999999997s)]
*  weary of that and has always left it to the Palestinian groups to lead their own their own [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2845.62s)]
*  struggle and if they need support that would come and of course it did but I do think that [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2852.42s)]
*  all these groups in the resistance actors all these actors do strategize in terms of long-term [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2859.62s)]
*  military strategy and I don't think it's a coincidence that both Hamas and Hezbollah [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2866.34s)]
*  initiated attacks on Israel I do think it is part of a wider kind of what Iran calls forward defense [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2870.9s)]
*  strategy and we might be seeing more of that over the years especially given that Hezbollah [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2876.42s)]
*  and others in the resistance axis have been talking about a great war for some time which [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2882.58s)]
*  they consider inevitable and so what we're basically looking at today isn't a case of if [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2887.3s)]
*  it's when again like I wrote in 2009 it's like when will this great war happen that will be a [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2893.54s)]
*  high intensity warfare it will be the same act as we're seeing now even more I presume Iran would [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2899.14s)]
*  join the fray then as well it would be high intensity warfare though so it would be full up [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2905.14s)]
*  you know full out regional war and it would be fought very differently and obviously the expectation [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2910.3399999999997s)]
*  is on the other side the US would be a co-belligerent in such a war so the only thing [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2917.2999999999997s)]
*  that no one is certain of is will this happen today or will it happen in five or ten years you [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2922.74s)]
*  know only time will tell so I do think this is going to be that war is going to be [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2927.14s)]
*  you know it is inevitable I think I don't I don't see how that can ever be avoided so long as Israel [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2934.2599999999998s)]
*  continues to exist in its current state so long as you know we're seeing whether it's a right-wing [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2940.9s)]
*  government or a left-wing government it's always aggressing against its neighbors and it's [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2947.14s)]
*  continuously you know involved in ethnic cleansing of Palestinians and I think that's [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2953.94s)]
*  something that is existential to Hezbollah I don't think it's just existential for Hamas and [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2958.1s)]
*  Islamic jihad it's existential because the expectation is that if Israel succeeds in this [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2964.26s)]
*  it's going to affect the whole future of Palestine the whole future of the region [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2970.34s)]
*  and that if the Palestinian cause you know falls if it collapses then Lebanon is definitely next [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2974.34s)]
*  so I do see this something that is unavoidable at least this is how Hezbollah views it [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2980.66s)]
*  yeah I don't I think people in the west don't too often don't understand this that [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2987.7s)]
*  it is not just a Palestinian issue in that in that respect in that regard because you know [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=2995.38s)]
*  it's highly likely that if Hezbollah didn't exist it never existed they would they would probably [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3002.02s)]
*  be Israeli settlers in south Lebanon now you know that's true yeah that's something Hezbollah has [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3007.22s)]
*  actually spoken about in the past that you know because Israel when it invaded Lebanon in 1982 [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3012.5s)]
*  it reached Beirut and you know it took a few years it was until 1985 it took three years for them to [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3019.8599999999997s)]
*  withdraw their forces to the security zone which was you know a belt or security belt and they [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3027.4599999999996s)]
*  basically occupied that area along with the south Lebanon army you know a group of militia of [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3034.3399999999997s)]
*  collaborators and you know they held on to that until to until the year 2000 but the fear was [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3039.8599999999997s)]
*  that if if they if Hezbollah didn't try and repel them that they would keep expanding and forming [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3046.3399999999997s)]
*  settlements and Israel's plan was to annex it still remains they still talk about Eretz Israel [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3051.3799999999997s)]
*  is to expand so this is what I mean by if Israel continues you know to behave as an expansionist [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3056.8999999999996s)]
*  state then I do think war the great war is inevitable yeah this may be like a half-baked [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3062.58s)]
*  question but it's it's been on my mind I mean what we've seen in the Gaza Strip over the past [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3070.9s)]
*  now we've entered the fourth month has been just a complete mask off moment for Israel I mean [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3079.06s)]
*  at first when they were beginning their calculated and systemic attack on hospitals in Gaza [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3086.26s)]
*  they were making a lot of excuses for it they were talking about tunnels under the hospitals [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3093.94s)]
*  they were talking about Hamas operating now they attack hospitals and don't even try to justify it [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3097.5400000000004s)]
*  so this is really like it's not even a mode of fighting this just complete genocide that they're [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3104.82s)]
*  that they've launched in Gaza do you think that had any effect on the equation of deterrence [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3114.8199999999997s)]
*  for Hezbollah do you think that they interpret Israel's mode of warfare differently because [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3121.62s)]
*  Israel's fighting Hezbollah very differently in the north than it is attacking Hamas and Gaza is [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3128.98s)]
*  this a misguided reading what do you what do you make of that that's a good question because [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3134.9s)]
*  because it's it's like you know under this current regime it's like the gloves are off [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3141.7000000000003s)]
*  and it's not just for Israel but also the gloves are off of the US of you know western powers [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3148.7400000000002s)]
*  and sort of genocide has become normalized and so has ethnic cleansing and now they have sort of [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3153.78s)]
*  euphemisms for these things you know like collateral damage and you know voluntary [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3158.1000000000004s)]
*  you know transfer and all the rest of it so it's seen as extremely sinister and worrying I would [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3165.06s)]
*  say by Hezbollah that Israel has now been given sort of the full political cover to continue with [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3171.62s)]
*  this strategy of genociding Palestinians now mind you in Lebanon I don't think the word genocide is [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3179.94s)]
*  the proper term because you know there were no sort of genocidal aims there were just war crimes [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3186.1s)]
*  right yeah it's different you know I don't think it's a term one should use loosely and I'm very [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3191.06s)]
*  careful with that but in Palestine it's definitely genocide which is different yeah the difference [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3195.06s)]
*  that I'm trying to get at is that there's like a different kind of mode in of engagement yes it's [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3200.74s)]
*  in sort of like totally like gloves are off you know this is who we are and we're just going to [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3207.14s)]
*  sort of declare genocidal intent whenever we want and and we don't even care about hiding it anymore [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3214.1s)]
*  like we have seen really quite a qualitative shift in discourse you know I think it was quite [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3219.62s)]
*  unexpected and you know the South African case now like there are pages and pages of these [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3225.62s)]
*  you know declarations so there clearly is a shift and I think I don't think Hezbollah ever had any [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3231.7s)]
*  kind of reservations about would would Israel be ready or willing to do that because we saw [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3237.94s)]
*  you know with the Dahya doctrine what Israel calls the Dahya doctrine which is a doctrine that it [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3242.58s)]
*  applied in the 2006 war against the Dahya which is southern suburbs of Beirut where the majority [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3246.98s)]
*  of the Shia community live they they targeted that area along with south Lebanon and when I [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3252.9s)]
*  say they targeted it I mean they just targeted civilian targets there so it's a disproportionate [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3258.1s)]
*  use of force in civilian areas and that's a very openly declared and articulated Israeli [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3263.94s)]
*  strategy that they're very proud of in fact so this isn't like an analysis or anything [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3270.66s)]
*  and they threatened Palestinians with this so before the Gaza war they were threatening Hamas [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3274.82s)]
*  and saying we're going to use the Dahya doctrine in Gaza and now what's interesting and absurd is [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3279.94s)]
*  they're now threatening Hezbollah to use the Gaza doctrine in Lebanon so it's like not only are we [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3284.5800000000004s)]
*  going to be committing war crimes we're going to we might be genocidal in Lebanon you know so it's [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3289.1400000000003s)]
*  just another kind of level of depravity we're talking about here and aggression so there [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3293.7000000000003s)]
*  definitely is I think a fear that Israel is just sort of completely like unhinged you know [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3300.42s)]
*  its leadership in terms of its aims it's unfettered as well it's unhinged and unfettered [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3307.14s)]
*  nobody is trying to restrain it and you know there is a sense that if it did launch a war on Lebanon [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3311.38s)]
*  it would be actually even more destructive than in the past for sure I do see that however Hezbollah [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3320.26s)]
*  is also I think very confident that it can inflict equal damage on Israel and with any war like [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3325.3s)]
*  even though this would be an asymmetrical war there is no doubt that Israel is militarily much [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3331.1400000000003s)]
*  more powerful than Hezbollah and it's you know one of the strongest armies in the region supposedly [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3335.78s)]
*  in terms of you know military you know weapons and sort of hard power indicators and so yeah not in [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3341.3s)]
*  terms of you know actual fighting or military prowess or anything like that just in terms of [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3347.3s)]
*  weapons and US backing it is you know a formidable force a very sophisticated weapons and so on [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3352.26s)]
*  but nonetheless I think Hezbollah believes that in relative terms it would you know it would prevent [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3360.0200000000004s)]
*  Israel from reoccupying Lebanon it would be able to repel as it did in 2006 an invasion [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3365.78s)]
*  and it would thwart all of Israel's aims and you know that's even without other groups joining the [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3372.42s)]
*  fray and Nasrallah has threatened that in the next war Hezbollah won't be alone that there will [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3377.54s)]
*  be tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands even he said of fighters from across the resistance [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3383.62s)]
*  axis who would you know want to defend Lebanon yes yeah and I mean it's interesting you bring [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3388.42s)]
*  up the Dahya doctrine because the Dahya doctrine this devastation this intentional and large scale [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3394.98s)]
*  devastation of civilian neighborhoods is driven by the aim of devastating the civilian population [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3405.22s)]
*  so much that they turn against the resistance of course this has never worked it has only empowered [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3416.58s)]
*  the resistance and increased the support of the resistance among the civilian population and [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3423.22s)]
*  the architect of the Dahya doctrine Israel's the Israeli army's chief of general staff Gadi [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3428.66s)]
*  Eisencott's son and nephew were both killed during their participation in the Israeli army's genocide [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3435.94s)]
*  in the Gaza Strip but kind of shifting gears I'd like us to talk about Iran and the axis of [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3446.74s)]
*  the axis of resistance briefly there is a clear emergence now of a unified ideological [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3455.94s)]
*  mostly ideological political and military confrontation of Israel but also in a much [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3470.9s)]
*  more cohesive understanding of the confrontation of Israel is also a confrontation of US empire [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3480.02s)]
*  in the region and I think that's a central understanding of why Ansarullah Hezbollah and [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3487.54s)]
*  Hamas who they're confronting really in the region so I there's there's a lot on the [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3494.82s)]
*  in the western left in the in the academic western left that try to draw some kind of equivalence [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3503.3s)]
*  between Iran and the Israeli occupation laughably they make the claim sometimes that Iran uses [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3513.7000000000003s)]
*  Palestinians or the Palestinian question as pawns I mean not only is this a radical misunderstanding [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3521.78s)]
*  of empire and regional relations at best I mean it's also a cynical endorsement of US empire [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3530.1s)]
*  either way it produces the same result first of all can you explain to our viewers and listeners [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3538.5s)]
*  what the axis of resistance is what the nature of Hezbollah's relations with Iran are and what [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3546.98s)]
*  your take is on such claims by the academic left I think I think you know this is this view that [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3556.18s)]
*  Iran and the resistance axis have sort of been weaponizing the Palestinian cause using Palestinians [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3566.1s)]
*  as pawns and so on and a larger sort of strategic battle first of all that sort of view rests on the [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3572.9s)]
*  sort of view rests on the proxy theory which which is a view of the different actors in the [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3579.38s)]
*  resistance axis which is essentially a US view a western sort of policy view and it's and it's [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3585.06s)]
*  quite a disturbing one because it suggests that people in the region don't have legitimate [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3592.1s)]
*  grievances first of all that they don't have agency as well that these different actors don't [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3597.1400000000003s)]
*  have their own agency their own objectives and strategies and so on so so it's a very problematic [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3602.6600000000003s)]
*  view to begin with and it's you know the very term proxy is one that has been used now as a [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3607.94s)]
*  signifier for terrorists and which justifies you know US and other sort of western attacks on [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3612.58s)]
*  the different groups that are called proxies so it's it's deeply problematic and so this view that [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3621.62s)]
*  the resistance axis is is instrumentalizing the Palestinian cause is is quite a historical one [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3628.02s)]
*  in fact and it's a form of historical revisionism if anything because what history has shown us and [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3633.94s)]
*  this can be you just very objectively I'm saying here you don't have to support Iran at all or [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3639.46s)]
*  Hezbollah's role in Syria and you know you can even consider these Hezbollah and these other [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3644.82s)]
*  groups as terrorist groups this has nothing to do with value judgments this is an objective reading [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3649.46s)]
*  of history is that Iran has been penalized repeatedly you know from the Islamic revolution [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3654.26s)]
*  onwards for its support of Palestine and in fact every US administration has offered Iran [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3660.02s)]
*  you know different sort of carrots in exchange for giving up the Palestinian cause and there was one [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3668.98s)]
*  leaked document in fact in 2003 called the grand bargain I don't know if you're familiar with it [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3673.54s)]
*  it was supposedly attributed to Iran and I'm not sure about you know that I investigated this once [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3678.74s)]
*  and the Iranians didn't this they kind of said we had nothing to do with this but nonetheless [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3684.58s)]
*  it's important because it's that that view was dominant in that document Iran supposedly said [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3690.02s)]
*  okay you know what we'll give up Hezbollah and Palestinian groups and we'll accept 1967 [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3696.2599999999998s)]
*  territories if you just back off and let us you know don't bomb us sort of thing and allow us to [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3702.58s)]
*  survive as a as an Islamic system or regime or whatever and so that that clearly reflects [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3708.18s)]
*  whether it's true or not whether that actually did take place and was in fact authored by Jawad Zarif [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3716.74s)]
*  as was claimed at the time by the New York Times and others that the US was in fact pushing Iran [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3721.3s)]
*  to abandon the Palestinian cause and abandon its support for Palestinian groups and in fact in [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3729.78s)]
*  almost every kind of US discourse about Iran we always hear about its support for terror right [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3734.02s)]
*  this is this is a common refrain so what does that mean that means the US acknowledges that [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3739.86s)]
*  Iran supports these groups you know forget Hezbollah for a minute that Iran supports and [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3744.98s)]
*  arms these groups that's what Israel's been saying and Israel has always threatened to bomb Iran [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3749.06s)]
*  because of this why is Iran considered the number one enemy of the US and Israel it's because it [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3753.86s)]
*  arms and supports you know groups like Hamas like Islamic Jihad like Hezbollah that fight Israel [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3760.1s)]
*  so to ignore that is is really it's a bit absurd honestly because these are historical facts [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3766.7400000000002s)]
*  and the truth is that if Iran went back to the sort of the Iran of the Shah's era where it was [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3774.18s)]
*  the US's policeman of the region where you know the the Mossad was active in Iran at the time [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3779.78s)]
*  where it served imperial interests where it served you know Zionist interests it was considered an [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3787.38s)]
*  ally of the US so if Iran would just shift I think to being what so-called moderate actor which just [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3792.9s)]
*  sort of is neutral let's say and doesn't I don't think that exists in international relations but [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3798.1s)]
*  if it just sort of withdrew support from these groups I'm sure it wouldn't be facing any more [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3802.9s)]
*  threats so I think that's that's the most important thing to look at and that's not to talk about [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3807.3s)]
*  even sort of Hezbollah's relations with Hamas and with even Fatah before them in terms of you know [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3812.02s)]
*  historic relations that go back decades in terms of training and equipping and so forth the very [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3817.62s)]
*  fact that it's open to front now the very fact these different groups that are supported by Iran [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3824.5s)]
*  from Ansarullah in Yemen to the PMU in Iraq to Hezbollah in Lebanon is that weaponizing [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3828.98s)]
*  the Palestinian cause I don't understand how that could be still construed as anything but confirming [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3834.82s)]
*  that these resistance axis whatever you think of it even if you're a US policy maker you would [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3842.02s)]
*  have to admit it is actively supporting and risking the security of these countries like Yemen is [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3848.02s)]
*  under risk now from a US attack Lebanon is under risk from Israeli US attack but because it's [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3855.38s)]
*  sponsored by the US same with the Iraqis they're being assassinated you know the assassinations [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3861.2200000000003s)]
*  have started not just in Lebanon and in Palestine but also in Iraq and in Syria so we're talking [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3866.58s)]
*  here about you know Hamas official was assassinated in Syria I think last week that's what I'm [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3874.26s)]
*  referring to so we are talking here about a risk to these different actors when they have intervened [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3879.62s)]
*  to support the Palestinians so I think that's something that is extremely cynical for anyone [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3886.5s)]
*  to sort of ignore history and ignore objective reality and say oh they're just weaponizing the [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3892.98s)]
*  cause what is the real relations then like what explain especially for our thick maybe our viewers [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3898.2599999999998s)]
*  who might not necessarily know what is the resistance axis and what are the real relations [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3905.7s)]
*  between Iran and Hezbollah let's say well the resistance axis is you know an alliance this term [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3912.66s)]
*  actually emerged around 2008 and it was used more and more frequently by the actors themselves over [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3922.8199999999997s)]
*  the years but it was I would say quite recently being used a lot more than in the past so in [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3929.94s)]
*  2000 in 2008 so we had after the July war obviously Hezbollah and Iran have always been very sort of [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3937.14s)]
*  you know tight allies and so has Hezbollah Iran and Palestinian groups those relations were [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3945.7000000000003s)]
*  strengthened after the war in Syria you know Iran Syria Hezbollah now obviously Hamas there was a [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3953.7s)]
*  falling out with Hamas in that period during the civil war in Syria but then there was a rapprochement [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3961.46s)]
*  and you know ties have been restored with all the different actors so I think today we can talk about [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3966.02s)]
*  a resistance axis much more than we could back then and back then mind you in the 2000s Ansarullah [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3972.3399999999997s)]
*  part of the axis and there weren't there was no Iraqi PMU until you know after 2014 so it's a term [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3978.02s)]
*  this axis has grown in size initially it was quite small and it expanded in size to incorporate [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3985.6200000000003s)]
*  these different actors you know from Lebanon to Yemen so we're talking here about an axe many [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3992.42s)]
*  people used to like to call it a Shia crescent actually just to sort of look back because [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=3998.5800000000004s)]
*  although the Syrian you know the Syrian government is Alawite it's considered Shia and even though [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4002.66s)]
*  the population in Syria is overwhelmingly Sunni they still sort of counted Syria as a Shia actor [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4009.54s)]
*  and Iran and Hezbollah so it was called the sort of Shia alliance and the elements that you know [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4015.22s)]
*  Hamas and Hamas which is a Sunni well Hamas is Sunni exactly and Ansarullah they're not Shia [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4021.14s)]
*  you know they're not actually properly Shia they're closer to I mean I know the Zaydi [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4029.1400000000003s)]
*  sect is considered a Shia sect but they're closer to Sunni Islam in fact so it depends how you [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4033.6200000000003s)]
*  define Shia really but nonetheless I think what's important is that they did try and sort of label [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4038.6600000000003s)]
*  it a Shia crescent to delegitimize it to make it lose sort of popular support yeah exactly and that [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4045.54s)]
*  was quite successful especially during the war in Syria to be fair like Hezbollah and Iran lost a [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4052.82s)]
*  lot of support according to opinion polls because of their intervention in Syria but I think you know [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4058.02s)]
*  what we're seeing today has completely changed that and in any way we are experiencing a period [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4064.5s)]
*  of desectarianization so I think that's that's also been very helpful to this axis in terms of [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4069.7s)]
*  popular support but to go back and look at the relations between them so many people as I said [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4074.1s)]
*  you know outside observers have called them sort of proxy relations that Iran leads this axis [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4081.22s)]
*  in fact they used to talk about Syria like that they used to say that Hezbollah was a proxy of [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4086.7400000000002s)]
*  Syria's and no one says that anymore because Syria has been weakened significantly in the strategic [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4091.46s)]
*  sense and in fact now it's quite ironic because Hezbollah kind of played a role in saving Syria so [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4096.34s)]
*  and in fact Hezbollah looks even more powerful for many you know by many metrics I'm not saying [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4102.74s)]
*  that's true but by many metrics it does look even more powerful as a regional power at least than [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4107.38s)]
*  Syria is and Syria was in a much stronger position in the past so you know we're talking here about [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4112.1s)]
*  relations that are ideological that are you know you've got historic ties cultural ties [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4118.34s)]
*  these are actors that share a strategic vision they share an ideology as I said it doesn't have [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4125.620000000001s)]
*  to be religious because even if we're talking about Shia actors you know the Assad regime is not [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4130.9800000000005s)]
*  religious it's a secular regime you know it's not like Iran and you know Ansarullah [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4136.42s)]
*  completely different religious ideology same with Hamas it's a different sect as well so [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4142.18s)]
*  these different actors have different religious ideologies but they do share in common an anti-imperialist [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4146.42s)]
*  vision and an anti-Zionist one and so I think the idea that they are just proxies of Iran is [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4153.700000000001s)]
*  just ridiculous in fact and that especially Hezbollah as you know Hezbollah today which has [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4160.26s)]
*  become a very influential regional power and that you know Nasrallah himself is widely considered to [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4166.5s)]
*  be the coordinator between the different actors and the resistance axis and there's a joint [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4173.62s)]
*  operations room between them that are coordinating you know the war with Israel today and this was [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4177.78s)]
*  the case for Syria as well mind you so it's not this joint operations room existed in Syria it [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4184.58s)]
*  existed in Iraq and today it exists for Palestine I'm not sure where the location is so [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4189.46s)]
*  we do see this Hezbollah is sort of the main coordinator between these different groups [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4196.900000000001s)]
*  and has sort of emerged as a regional what I call regional sub-power in its own right because it's a [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4201.14s)]
*  non-state actor so it's not a full-blown regional power but it's a regional sub-power and so it's [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4205.54s)]
*  very very difficult to conceive of the relationship between Iran and these different actors particularly [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4211.38s)]
*  Hezbollah as one between a sponsor and a proxy it enjoys a lot of autonomy and I think the biggest [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4217.860000000001s)]
*  problem is because there is so much convergence in terms of their strategic objectives people [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4223.22s)]
*  tend to believe that that those objectives wouldn't be held by these actors if it wasn't [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4228.740000000001s)]
*  for Iran that doesn't make any sense because none of these groups are acting against what they perceive [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4234.1s)]
*  as their own self-interest or their national interest now other people might say oh that's [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4238.42s)]
*  that shouldn't be your interest or that's not the national interest but that's how they conceive [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4243.06s)]
*  their interests so you know just because they're in alignment with one another that doesn't mean [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4247.38s)]
*  Iran is calling the shots and telling them oh go fight you know go fight on this front or Hamas [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4253.22s)]
*  even more ridiculous were people who claimed that Hamas was acting on Iran's orders now [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4258.18s)]
*  that can you imagine after 75 years of you know Israel's Nakba it's an ongoing Nakba against [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4262.900000000001s)]
*  Palestinians that people would think that Hamas is taking orders from Iran and acting against [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4269.3s)]
*  its self-interest is absurd no matter what you think of Hamas like talk about your regular sort [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4274.34s)]
*  of US policymaker that's an absurd view to have because it's it's ahistorical so what we're talking [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4278.34s)]
*  here is what we're talking about here is a long-standing history of shared you know historical [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4284.900000000001s)]
*  experiences and traumas even collective trauma in the region this is what these these different [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4290.82s)]
*  actors share so they're going to act in concert and they might have some minor differences here [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4295.7s)]
*  or there in terms of tactics and so on but that's going to be the extent of it [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4300.74s)]
*  so it's it's it's very over simplistic to put it mildly to call them sort of proxies of Iran [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4305.219999999999s)]
*  it's part of the same effort um excuse me it's part of the same aim of also painting them as just [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4312.66s)]
*  a kind of ISIS and you know these like thoughtless no strategy terrorist islamist groups [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4321.7s)]
*  it's it's all part of the same effort of just completely stripping them of any kind of political [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4331.14s)]
*  motivations but clear political motivations um like they don't have any agency right the US [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4335.78s)]
*  I think are now starting to realize it's not in their interest for Israel to be this unhinged [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4344.5s)]
*  settler colony they'd like to be an imperial outpost but not a settler colony to this extent [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4350.02s)]
*  you know it's a little bit of settler colonialism but not too much kind of thing so they do differ [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4356.26s)]
*  Israel can only be useful to the United States if it's not a loose bull in a china shop they need [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4361.38s)]
*  to have some kind of control otherwise they're just a clear liability a liability to internal [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4368.660000000001s)]
*  domestic politics a liability on the world stage as they pass the United States continuously [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4374.58s)]
*  as a pariah um I completely agree with you that you know Israel without the United States would [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4381.14s)]
*  collapse in a week it's we've seen a very uh clear example of that through the resistance um [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4388.1s)]
*  assault that led on Israel's southern you know military um uh outposts but it's but it's [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4397.62s)]
*  yeah there's there's there's a fine line between being a useful outpost a useful um [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4409.7s)]
*  uh what did you call it a useful out yes a useful strategic outpost outpost and being just like an [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4417.86s)]
*  outright rogue smotrich bang ver um uh bull in a china shop I agree with that and I think that um [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4425.78s)]
*  that actually Israel and the U.S.'s interests people people forget this but Israel and the U.S. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4435.14s)]
*  interests do clash sometimes it does happen I mean you just have to look at the case of [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4441.78s)]
*  Jonathan Pollard the Israeli spy who stole U.S. secrets for that and there's uh you know there's [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4445.46s)]
*  a lot to be said about that but we don't have the time to get into that you would never find [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4452.419999999999s)]
*  like the other day Israeli I forgot which Israeli official but even Netanyahu himself has sort of [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4457.219999999999s)]
*  come out come out openly at odds with the U.S. and have you know you know been furious at the [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4462.0199999999995s)]
*  way they're being treated by the Biden administration and said you know we you know we can do our own [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4467.46s)]
*  thing you don't tell us what to do don't infantilize us I've had many such statements coming out of [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4472.74s)]
*  Israel and that is something you would never see among the different actors and the resistance [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4477.62s)]
*  axis because it's a completely different type of relationship which is much more organic it's not [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4482.18s)]
*  that it's more disciplined it's more organic and natural whereas this is this is a different type [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4487.78s)]
*  of relationship clearly I mean it's called the special relationship but you know only only because [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4492.18s)]
*  of certain um commonalities um it's not it's by no means organic or natural yeah and the U.S. is [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4496.98s)]
*  largely fighting its own war in the region through Israel so once Israel gets out of line [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4505.3s)]
*  and I mean what you're referring to it was Smotrich who basically spelled out very clearly [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4512.820000000001s)]
*  Israel's intentions of ethnically cleansing Palestinians from the Gaza Strip and uh Blinken [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4518.820000000001s)]
*  and all the other psychopaths are saying okay well you know this is not really in line with um [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4525.78s)]
*  um our full intentions so it's it's the break is not one of um ideology it's one it's one of [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4531.54s)]
*  strategy and uh as long as Israel stays within the Yair Lapid uh respectability politics you know [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4539.94s)]
*  wolf in sheep's clothing I think the U.S. is would very much stay behind them I mean it's not like [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4549.94s)]
*  it's not like the Biden administration has like walked back in any meaningful way from a single [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4556.74s)]
*  Trump policy that's yeah no it's just it's I think they're just embarrassed because [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4562.099999999999s)]
*  this isn't just a sort of a respectable right right wing this is like a very sort of unhinged [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4568.42s)]
*  marginal fringe right wing or at least some of these not not all of them but some of them like [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4573.3s)]
*  Smotrich and others so it's it's I wouldn't say it's embarrassing to the U.S. they haven't embarrassed [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4578.82s)]
*  them at all unfortunately but they just don't their interests don't converge I would say on [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4582.74s)]
*  many of these issues like ethnic cleansing like wanting to take over Gaza you know things like [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4588.179999999999s)]
*  that that the U.S. wants a different type of ethnic cleansing not the same kind of type so it's it's [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4594.42s)]
*  um yeah there are definitely strategic differences I think even there but um well Amal Saad thank you [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlriUZZuKik&t=4598.98s)]
