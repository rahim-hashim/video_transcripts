# How Zionism pushes liberalism into decay, with Matteo Capasso | EI Podcast
**The Electronic Intifada:** [March 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs)
*  Hello and welcome back to the Electronic Intifada podcast. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Nora Barrows-Freedman. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  Liberalism has reached a comatose stage and so has the West. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=5.16s)]
*  The ravings that liberal intellectuals are ready to perform [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=9.84s)]
*  to justify their lust for violence in Palestine [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=13.6s)]
*  or their support for Nazi movements across the EU [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=16.6s)]
*  is indicative of the coming collapse. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=20.2s)]
*  History moves in the direction of the South [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=22.68s)]
*  towards a horizon of prosperity [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=25.2s)]
*  for the majority of the world. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=27.48s)]
*  The Palestinians in the axis of resistance [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=29.32s)]
*  are making an indomitable contribution [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=31.68s)]
*  to this historical movement. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=34.08s)]
*  What a moment to be alive. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=36.0s)]
*  Those are the words written by my guest, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=38.16s)]
*  Mateo Omar Capaso, a fellow at Columbia University's [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=40.36s)]
*  Department of Middle Eastern, South Asian, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=44.44s)]
*  and African Studies and the Managing Editor [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  at Mid-East Critique. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=48.84s)]
*  Mateo is also the author of Everyday Politics [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=50.72s)]
*  in the Libyan Arab Jema Haria. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=53.36s)]
*  Mateo, it's so good to finally have you [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=56.04s)]
*  on the Electronic Into Photo podcast. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=57.68s)]
*  Thank you so much, Nora, for having me. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=59.92s)]
*  So those words that I read, you posted on Twitter [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=62.88s)]
*  a few days ago about liberalism in the context [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=67.44s)]
*  of the US-Israeli genocide in Gaza [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=70.08s)]
*  and how the so-called civilized West in this moment [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=73.48s)]
*  is in a death spiral. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=77.28s)]
*  I wanted to bring you on to talk about the moment [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=80.48s)]
*  that we're in and how we should be looking [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=83.44s)]
*  at the broader picture of how the West defends [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=86.32s)]
*  the indefensible genocide of Palestinians [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=90.19999999999999s)]
*  and really what this shows us. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=92.55999999999999s)]
*  What have you been thinking about in this context? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  Thanks, thank you so much. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=99.0s)]
*  It's a pleasure to be here with you guys. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=100.08s)]
*  I mean, you're doing such an amazing work [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=101.8s)]
*  trying to keep us updated. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=103.83999999999999s)]
*  And in that process, it's really amazing [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=107.35999999999999s)]
*  how you're also providing us, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=110.6s)]
*  you all at Electronic Into Photo, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=112.76s)]
*  the tray of hope and needed support [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=114.88s)]
*  to understand what is happening on the ground. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=123.2s)]
*  So it's really a pleasure to be exchanging [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=125.2s)]
*  these ideas with you. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=127.08s)]
*  Nora, we are leaving, I think, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=130.04s)]
*  an unprecedented moment in history. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=131.8s)]
*  I don't think we've ever been able, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=134.6s)]
*  or we will ever be able to digest the pace [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=138.44s)]
*  and the significance of the genocide [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=141.48s)]
*  that this colonial entity, Western colonial entity, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=144.52s)]
*  which goes by the name of Israel, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=148.72s)]
*  is actually undertaking in the territory of the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=150.4s)]
*  It is unprecedented because what we're seeing [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=157.32s)]
*  is a total moment of decay and decline. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=160.36s)]
*  It's a political decline, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=164.6s)]
*  but it's also a moral decay of the West, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=165.8s)]
*  which is intensified when we look at Palestine [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=168.28s)]
*  because it is really taking the form of a genocide [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=172.24s)]
*  perpetrated by the Zionists. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=179.4s)]
*  So you see, when we talk about Europe, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=182.88s)]
*  and as a currently, we're also talking about the US [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=185.68s)]
*  because there is an unbelievable chord [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=189.08s)]
*  between these two social and political formations. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=190.68s)]
*  We're constantly bombarded by this idea [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=193.84s)]
*  by what I call the media, but when I say the media, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=197.72s)]
*  I am talking about those media who have a direct interest [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=201.72s)]
*  to function as an extended arm of the ruling class, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=204.88s)]
*  so the bourgeois media. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=208.39999999999998s)]
*  So the media are telling us that [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=209.88s)]
*  what is happening in Ukraine, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=211.76s)]
*  what is happening in Palestine, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=212.92s)]
*  and I am sure that our ruling classes [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=214.23999999999998s)]
*  would be very happy to see this happening in Taiwan as well, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=216.12s)]
*  what is happening in these regions of the world [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=218.92s)]
*  is a fight to protect our values, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=220.88s)]
*  our liberal and democratic values. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=224.64s)]
*  So we have this idea, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=226.52s)]
*  and Netanyahu came out also talking about this, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  this is the forces of light against the forces of darkness. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=231.76000000000002s)]
*  And the same is happening with NATO in Ukraine. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=235.68s)]
*  So Ukraine wants to become a liberal democracy [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=237.96s)]
*  like other countries of the European Union, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=240.84s)]
*  but Russia, the dictatorship is not allowing this. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=243.16000000000003s)]
*  On the contrary, the leftists are even saying [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=246.84s)]
*  that Russia's imperial ambitions [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=249.72s)]
*  is gonna take up the whole of Europe. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=251.12s)]
*  Now, in the case of Israel, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=252.96s)]
*  it's already the only liberal democratic country [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=254.2s)]
*  in a region of dictators. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=258.12s)]
*  So it must be defended [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=259.84s)]
*  because it incarnates our democratic values. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=261.44s)]
*  This premise is important to understand [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=265.12s)]
*  because what keeps coming out [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=267.0s)]
*  of our European ruling classes and the media [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=269.36s)]
*  that the agents who administer this narrative for them [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=271.64s)]
*  is the word liberalism and democracy. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=275.36s)]
*  Now, we've gotten so used to these two words [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=277.84s)]
*  that basically we've lost their meaning. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  And I refer to the facts and contradictions [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=283.68s)]
*  that cumulatively have determined the rise [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=287.36s)]
*  of what we call liberalism. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=291.12s)]
*  So what is liberalism really? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=293.16s)]
*  What is a liberal democracy? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=294.8s)]
*  This is why we need to go back to this. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=296.6s)]
*  And I think that, and also, how does liberalism emerge? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=298.64s)]
*  What does it mean? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=303.04s)]
*  Is it Europe really a liberal democracy? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=303.96000000000004s)]
*  And for that matter, the US? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=306.2s)]
*  Well, the short answer obviously is no, but why? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=308.4s)]
*  Because liberalism refers philosophically, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=312.04s)]
*  at least to this idea of negative freedom, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=315.08s)]
*  which is individual, inviolable affirmation of freedom [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=316.96s)]
*  from the interference by the state or whatever else. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=321.24s)]
*  I can marry whenever I want. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=326.32s)]
*  I can do business as much as I want. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=328.12s)]
*  The state should not be interfering in these affairs. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=330.4s)]
*  Now, and this is why also, you know, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=334.04s)]
*  there has been like a big backlash with the pandemic [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=336.8s)]
*  because, you know, why would the state interfere [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=339.8s)]
*  so much in our lives? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=342.76s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=344.68s)]
*  So the problem lies in the fact that liberalism as an idea [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=345.76s)]
*  and as a political praxis as well arose as a celebration, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=350.32s)]
*  not of universal freedom, which it claims though to do, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=354.24s)]
*  but of a well-defined community of people. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=359.64s)]
*  Because when we look at the, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=363.56s)]
*  and this is fantastic work done by numerous academics, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=365.0s)]
*  one of them also an Italian one being Domenico Lo Surdo, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=368.36s)]
*  and Joseph Massad also has written about this. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=371.48s)]
*  It's basically when you look at the most influential thinkers [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=373.52000000000004s)]
*  of Tocqueville and others, and John Locke about liberalism, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=377.0s)]
*  everybody describes liberalism as a privilege [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=381.6s)]
*  of a white supremacist circle of people. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=384.44s)]
*  And this consolidated in the US and the UK. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=389.2s)]
*  So what does it mean liberalism [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=391.64s)]
*  as the privilege of an elite? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=394.24s)]
*  It means that there are constitutive elements to liberalism [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=398.52s)]
*  that are hidden, put on the side, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=403.44s)]
*  which defined liberalism from its, you know, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=408.8s)]
*  when it was born. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=411.84000000000003s)]
*  Basically, the genocide of the natives in the US [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=413.08s)]
*  are perpetrated by the Europeans [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=418.96000000000004s)]
*  and the slavery of black Africans. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=421.72s)]
*  So in other words, colonialism, plundering and genocide [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=423.76s)]
*  are constitutive elements [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=427.0s)]
*  of this political and ideological movement. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=428.44s)]
*  So all this, you know, the slaves and the natives [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=432.28s)]
*  were completely excluded from this. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=436.8s)]
*  And what we are seeing now happening, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=440.03999999999996s)]
*  you fast forward this despite there has been, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=442.52s)]
*  and we can talk about this, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=445.84s)]
*  there have been changes to liberalism as a concept [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=447.48s)]
*  and it has been able to include more, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=450.08s)]
*  but this is precisely our liberalism, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=453.88s)]
*  you know, in a way dupes the masses [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=457.12s)]
*  because it gives an idea that it can change, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=460.8s)]
*  that there's something inherent inside liberalism [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=463.08s)]
*  that we don't have slavery anymore. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=466.08s)]
*  Well, it was because Haiti had a revolution, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=468.36s)]
*  which was an anti-slavery revolution. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=470.64s)]
*  It's because we had the revolution in 1917 [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=472.64s)]
*  by Vladimir Lenin and the Russians and the communists [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=474.96s)]
*  that pushed against certain limits [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=479.64s)]
*  that liberalism and imperialism had put in place. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=483.08s)]
*  But this is not recognized obviously. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=486.47999999999996s)]
*  The liberal world was forced to accept this material victories [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=488.52s)]
*  often gained through armed struggle. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=494.2s)]
*  So what we're seeing now, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=497.71999999999997s)]
*  it's exactly the story repeating itself [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=499.96s)]
*  in different forces with a different connection obviously, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=503.88s)]
*  one between Israel and the US that is, you know, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=506.96s)]
*  we cannot find back in the days of the 14th and 16th century, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=509.71999999999997s)]
*  but what we're seeing is an anti-colonial struggle [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=514.04s)]
*  that is pushing for a renewed engagement of what the world, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=517.48s)]
*  the meanings of humanity and world order stand for, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=523.04s)]
*  but it's finding this massive backlash [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=527.48s)]
*  and the complete normalization of genocide and plundering. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=530.4s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=534.56s)]
*  And the way that these Western countries, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=535.64s)]
*  you know, first and foremost, the US, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=539.92s)]
*  is so condescending and paternalistic [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=543.4s)]
*  about Palestinians and their right to defend themselves. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=547.76s)]
*  You know, I mean, they just said just earlier this week [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=556.0s)]
*  at the UN Security Council, you know, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=558.68s)]
*  in trying to justify their veto [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=561.6s)]
*  of a mild ceasefire resolution, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=565.16s)]
*  the US said, you know, this is not in the best interests [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=569.88s)]
*  of the Palestinians while they're being slaughtered, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=572.52s)]
*  while hospitals are being leveled, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=575.48s)]
*  while children are dying from malnutrition [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=577.4s)]
*  and a lack of food, a starvation that is being engineered [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=582.88s)]
*  by the Israelis in the US. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=586.88s)]
*  You know, how does this keep working? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=591.52s)]
*  How does the cycle of like, you know, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=596.36s)]
*  the notion of liberal democracy right now keep working [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=598.76s)]
*  with the corporate media as the arm, as the platform? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=602.72s)]
*  You know, I just think about all of these, you know, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=609.36s)]
*  very well-meaning liberal, you know, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=611.96s)]
*  white people here in the US and in Europe who you say, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=615.68s)]
*  oh, it's so bad what's happening to Palestinians, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=620.3199999999999s)]
*  but you know, what else is Israel supposed to do? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=624.76s)]
*  How does this keep happening? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=629.68s)]
*  What's at the core of it? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=631.76s)]
*  At the core of it, I think we find two process [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=634.24s)]
*  that they need to be understood in a way dialectically, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=636.36s)]
*  meaning there is, you know, by dialectic, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=642.1999999999999s)]
*  I mean, you know, this idea that there is a material relation [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=647.88s)]
*  that unites, that makes Israel central [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=654.6s)]
*  to the project of, to the Western project of domination [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=659.76s)]
*  of the world, which does exist. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=663.5200000000001s)]
*  And then there is the, from there it emerges or it is, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=667.12s)]
*  you know, it comes, you know, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=672.24s)]
*  it is organic to this material project, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=674.92s)]
*  the ideological component that then eventually we find [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=678.1999999999999s)]
*  in this arms of the ruling class that propagate this [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=683.64s)]
*  narrative, which it's, you know, the mainstream media. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=687.76s)]
*  So to go back to basically to the material relation, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=691.76s)]
*  what needs to be understood is that what it's happening [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=696.88s)]
*  in Palestine is not something that has to do [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=699.96s)]
*  with two peoples for two states or the Muslim people [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=705.52s)]
*  vis-a-vis the Christians, vis-a-vis the Jewish people. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=711.64s)]
*  This is an identitarian framing that it's not helpful [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=714.96s)]
*  and it's obviously very convenient to take in order not [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=720.2800000000001s)]
*  to realize what are the stakes and what is the core issue [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=724.76s)]
*  of the situation in Palestine. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=730.72s)]
*  The issue is, you know, emanates, emerges from the, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=735.96s)]
*  from the what is the American project. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=741.88s)]
*  American project or Western led project is a project [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=744.1600000000001s)]
*  that usually is called imperialism. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=747.48s)]
*  And by that, I mean a system where there is a material [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=749.5600000000001s)]
*  exploitation of the South by countries of the North, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=752.44s)]
*  which happens in collaboration with the bourgeois elements, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=756.92s)]
*  ruling segments of the South of the world. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=761.16s)]
*  So there is a material relation of exploitation. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=763.92s)]
*  How does this take place through military policies, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=767.9599999999999s)]
*  economic policies, you don't accept, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=771.4399999999999s)]
*  you don't do what I am asking you to do. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=774.4799999999999s)]
*  You don't open up your country. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=776.9599999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna come and do a regime change [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=778.28s)]
*  or I impose sanctions on you, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=781.12s)]
*  which is definitely one of these features that, you know, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=784.08s)]
*  unites all the elements of the axis of resistance, by the way. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=787.64s)]
*  Now, ideologically, what we see is that these countries [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=790.64s)]
*  are under also another type of war, an ideological war, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=796.12s)]
*  which can use also the, you know, includes the use of, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=799.4s)]
*  unfortunately, of progressive ideas [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=802.44s)]
*  that could be progressive, de-linked from liberalism, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=805.8s)]
*  which are like the ideas of gender, gender violence, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=809.08s)]
*  which, you know, we've seen this happening right now [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=811.8399999999999s)]
*  in the US and in the UN, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=814.24s)]
*  the way it has been completely weaponized [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=815.52s)]
*  to create this monstrous entity [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=817.88s)]
*  being the Palestinians resistance faction. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=821.8399999999999s)]
*  Now, for this project of American imperialism [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=824.8399999999999s)]
*  to consolidate in the world after World War II, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=827.5999999999999s)]
*  it was necessary to reconfigure, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=831.88s)]
*  to integrate different parts of the region [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=833.92s)]
*  according to the needs of US interests. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=836.88s)]
*  The Arab region had a specific interest. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=840.12s)]
*  Why? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=842.5200000000001s)]
*  Because there was oil, oil represented a key, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=843.36s)]
*  a crucial element for the maintenance, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=847.24s)]
*  the sustainment of the dollarized economy of the US. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=850.24s)]
*  And so they needed to control this region. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=855.9200000000001s)]
*  How did they do that? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=858.5200000000001s)]
*  Through two main and faithful allies, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=859.72s)]
*  the reactionary Gulf monarchies, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=862.1600000000001s)]
*  whose role, the speakable role they're playing right now, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=863.84s)]
*  we can see, and Israel. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=866.24s)]
*  And so this is where Israel becomes so central [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=868.72s)]
*  because Israel from 1943 to 2003 [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=871.28s)]
*  has been showered with military aid [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=874.3199999999999s)]
*  and all kinds of loans up to 260,000 billions, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=878.24s)]
*  which, you know, the Israelis have medical insurance, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=883.3199999999999s)]
*  which you guys don't have. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=886.48s)]
*  The Israelis are provided with everything. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=888.28s)]
*  Why does this take place? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=890.88s)]
*  Well, because Israel is an investment. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=892.88s)]
*  There are two key outposts for imperialism in the world. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=895.76s)]
*  One, it's Israel and the other one is Taiwan. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=898.32s)]
*  And they are central to the dominance [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=900.76s)]
*  of US imperialism in the world. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=904.12s)]
*  So the moment the Palestinians attack [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=907.0s)]
*  or defend themselves vis-a-vis this colonial occupation [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=911.04s)]
*  that is financed by the West, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=915.12s)]
*  then the whole world goes up in arms. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=918.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=920.84s)]
*  And also at the same time, and you mentioned this, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=923.68s)]
*  the resistance of, the axis of resistance [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=926.68s)]
*  is building momentum as well. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=931.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, we saw just, you know, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=934.28s)]
*  just in the last couple months, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=937.72s)]
*  how the Yemeni armed forces are, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=939.2s)]
*  you know, are holding steadfast [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=945.24s)]
*  in this Red Sea blockade against Israeli ships in commerce. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=947.96s)]
*  And of course, we see Hezbollah in Lebanon [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=954.44s)]
*  and talk about how the axis of resistance, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=961.6400000000001s)]
*  what it is and how it fits into this context [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=967.24s)]
*  as counterhegemonic to the aims of Western Israel. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=970.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=975.92s)]
*  The aims of Western imperialism with Israel at its core. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=976.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=980.96s)]
*  Exactly, because, you know, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=982.64s)]
*  thank you for framing it in this way, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=984.6s)]
*  because that's precisely the needed frame [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=986.24s)]
*  to understand what is happening. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=991.16s)]
*  Because the moment you understand [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=992.52s)]
*  that there is an imperialist structure, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=994.16s)]
*  which is simply, you know, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=996.12s)]
*  the acceptance that there are hierarchies [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=998.32s)]
*  in the world system. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1000.8s)]
*  And the West has been at the top of this [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1002.6s)]
*  since the 14th century, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1005.52s)]
*  due to a history of genocides and force, basically. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1007.12s)]
*  Now the West is declining, obviously. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1011.72s)]
*  So, and this is where the spaces for resistance come [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1014.16s)]
*  and, you know, the cracks are opening up. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1018.2s)]
*  But Israel has a central role. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1021.24s)]
*  It's an investment in militarism. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1023.24s)]
*  So Israel is important to be there [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1025.0s)]
*  because we can control the region. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1026.76s)]
*  At the same time, by controlling the region, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1028.0s)]
*  we can crush any form of developmental [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1030.64s)]
*  and political force that emerges from the region [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1034.8000000000002s)]
*  in order to challenge the project of imperialism. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1038.44s)]
*  This happened back in the days of, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1041.2800000000002s)]
*  in the 60s and the 70s and the 50s, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1044.64s)]
*  from the 50s to the 70s. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1046.92s)]
*  This is how the project of Pan-Arabism [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1048.2800000000002s)]
*  was defeated militarily with sanctions, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1050.5200000000002s)]
*  with wars, with two wars against Israel. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1054.5600000000002s)]
*  So Pan-Arabism, in a way, tried to fight [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1057.56s)]
*  against the project of imperialism, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1061.8799999999999s)]
*  but didn't manage to win, to assert itself [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1064.1599999999999s)]
*  and to change the equation of force in the region. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1068.6799999999998s)]
*  But fast forward all these years as, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1073.12s)]
*  and you see that with the decline of Pan-Arabism, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1076.44s)]
*  another axis slowly started to come out of the region. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1082.08s)]
*  And by axis, I mean, simply a collective [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1086.04s)]
*  of social political forces who understand [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1089.92s)]
*  that in order to achieve national liberation, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1093.8799999999999s)]
*  so national independence from a political [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1097.3999999999999s)]
*  and economic point of view, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1099.44s)]
*  you need to strategize collectively, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1100.92s)]
*  come together an ally and create a different model. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1105.08s)]
*  And fight, obviously, challenge the oppressor, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1109.84s)]
*  the foreign invaders, so imperialism. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1112.92s)]
*  And this is where Palestine becomes so central. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1115.32s)]
*  It's per history, it's a historical necessity. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1118.6399999999999s)]
*  It's not that the Palestinians are unique, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1121.6799999999998s)]
*  although this is all this propaganda around the Holy Land. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1123.9199999999998s)]
*  It just doesn't make any sense. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1128.28s)]
*  It's ideological, but there is a material premise to this. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1130.2s)]
*  This is why it's so important. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1134.4399999999998s)]
*  And so what is the axis? [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1136.84s)]
*  The axis is composed by five actors, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1138.08s)]
*  who are Iran, the state of Iran, the Islamic Republic, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1141.9199999999998s)]
*  Hezbollah in Lebanon, Ansarullah, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1147.96s)]
*  which means the government of Yemen, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1151.0s)]
*  the Qatari Hezbollah and other factions in Iraq, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1153.4399999999998s)]
*  and obviously Syria, the Syrian Arab Republic, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1157.3999999999999s)]
*  and obviously the Palestinian factions. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1162.08s)]
*  All those that have been labeled terrorist. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1164.04s)]
*  So obviously not the Palestinian Authority, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1166.9199999999998s)]
*  but Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1168.84s)]
*  and the Popular Forum for the Liberation of Palestine. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1172.6399999999999s)]
*  Now, what do the mainstream will not want to tell you [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1176.36s)]
*  that there is something uniting, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1184.12s)]
*  keeping, gluing these different forces. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1187.1599999999999s)]
*  The idea is that everybody's a puppet of Iran, okay? [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1189.84s)]
*  They are all acting according to the interests of Iran. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1193.8s)]
*  Everybody's doing what Iran says. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1196.6399999999999s)]
*  We know the story there. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1199.48s)]
*  But each one of them, what do they have in common? [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1202.08s)]
*  They have in common that each one of them has been crushed [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1204.76s)]
*  by the forces of imperialism throughout history. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1207.88s)]
*  Hezbollah emerges after the invasion of Lebanon in 1982. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1212.8s)]
*  The Popular Mobilization Unit in Iraq [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1218.6s)]
*  emerged after numerous invasion of Iraq [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1221.04s)]
*  and bombing of Iraq, especially the 2003 one, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1224.28s)]
*  and the creation of ISIS, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1227.16s)]
*  which was another fundamental arm [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1229.6000000000001s)]
*  of the material and political struggle [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1231.76s)]
*  that imperialism waged on the Arab region and West Asia. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1234.1200000000001s)]
*  Syria, there was a regime change attempt [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1239.16s)]
*  from 2011 and onward, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1244.4s)]
*  trying to destabilize completely Syria [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1246.92s)]
*  to cut the supply lines for the resistance. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1249.16s)]
*  Iran has been under sanctions for decades. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1252.88s)]
*  So how are we surprised by the fact [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1255.6s)]
*  that all these countries come together [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1260.08s)]
*  and they realize that, look, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1263.48s)]
*  we are all fighting a common enemy here. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1266.6799999999998s)]
*  That enemy is Western imperialism. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1270.8799999999999s)]
*  They don't want us to develop. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1273.6s)]
*  They don't want us to be liberated. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1276.08s)]
*  And Yemen is the same. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1279.32s)]
*  Wars since 2003 with the world on terror up to 2015. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1280.48s)]
*  Spareheaded by the Gulf countries with Western support. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1285.9199999999998s)]
*  And in all this, how are we going to really [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1291.04s)]
*  understand the centrality of Palestine? [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1298.56s)]
*  Again, there is a centrality [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1301.28s)]
*  of the Zionist project to imperialism. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1303.08s)]
*  Imperialism is an obstacle to the liberation [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1305.1599999999999s)]
*  and to the economic and political [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1310.48s)]
*  and social development of the region. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1312.4399999999998s)]
*  So inevitably, Palestine becomes central for this. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1315.0s)]
*  It's astonishing to, you know, just to, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1323.2s)]
*  I mean, I know you were talking with Rania Khalek [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1329.88s)]
*  about this recently on her show, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1331.8s)]
*  which I encourage everyone to go and check out. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1334.1200000000001s)]
*  Just that this very normalized demonization of Iran, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1337.56s)]
*  that just is, you know, a given. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1343.36s)]
*  And then by proxy, you know, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1346.36s)]
*  the forces against Western imperialism [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1348.8799999999999s)]
*  from Palestine to Yemen, to Iraq and Syria and Lebanon. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1351.84s)]
*  And it's just, I mean, there's something about also how, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1356.28s)]
*  you know, when Western liberals talk [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1364.96s)]
*  about the Palestinian resistance as, you know, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1369.28s)]
*  being agents of Iran and they don't, you know, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1372.32s)]
*  they're not fighting for their people. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1376.48s)]
*  They're actually, their people hate them. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1378.48s)]
*  And they're just doing this [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1381.84s)]
*  because Iran is telling them to. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1383.44s)]
*  This is just accepted. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1385.84s)]
*  I mean, there's this normalized anti-Arab racism [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1387.52s)]
*  and a normalized kind of a fetishization [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1394.0s)]
*  of, you know, when we see, for example, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1400.0s)]
*  the people who backed regime change in Syria [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1402.68s)]
*  and their rallying cry was, you know, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1405.12s)]
*  listen to Syrians, you know, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1407.52s)]
*  what about Syrian agency? [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1411.8s)]
*  Well, they're talking about the agency of the elite. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1413.24s)]
*  And it's also applicable when we talk about, [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1415.76s)]
*  you know, when liberals talk about Palestinians, [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1420.04s)]
*  where they, you know, they just listen to the ones [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1423.16s)]
*  that are helping the US led project. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1426.2s)]
*  And, you know, so can you talk really [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1432.88s)]
*  about the moral struggle of the resistance axis [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1437.3600000000001s)]
*  and how the perception of resistance is only really valued [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1441.76s)]
*  if it is militarized, you know, Western states [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1446.88s)]
*  doing the violence, dropping the bombs. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1450.48s)]
*  You know, I'm always thinking about that meme of like, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1453.8s)]
*  you know, an F-16 fighter jet dropping missile, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1457.1599999999999s)]
*  you know, a US fighter jet dropping missiles [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1460.9199999999998s)]
*  on, you know, an Arab country, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1464.52s)]
*  but it has like the rainbow flag on the tail of the plane, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1467.6s)]
*  you know, a kinder, gentler imperialism. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1472.12s)]
*  Yeah, can you talk about that a little bit? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1476.8s)]
*  I mean, I think I would probably go back [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1479.24s)]
*  or start by, you know, picking up on what you were saying [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1481.88s)]
*  about the relationship between liberalism, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1485.16s)]
*  as again, as an ideology and Islam. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1490.0400000000002s)]
*  Why I think this is important. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1494.3200000000002s)]
*  I think it's important because the moment we understand [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1496.8000000000002s)]
*  the connection that runs between liberalism and colonialism. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1502.0400000000002s)]
*  And so the idea that liberalism is basically [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1506.3200000000002s)]
*  about the protection of individual freedom [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1509.72s)]
*  of a tiny and privileged minority, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1512.0s)]
*  which back in the days was a white supremacy elite. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1514.8s)]
*  And now it's the elite of the West, basically. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1517.96s)]
*  Then we know that this liberalism is premised [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1523.0s)]
*  on the violent exclusion and killing of others. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1525.76s)]
*  But when we move to the question of Palestine and Iran [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1530.04s)]
*  and the axis as a whole, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1532.92s)]
*  Islam then becomes central here to understand, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1534.4s)]
*  but Islam becomes central to liberalism in various ways. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1537.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1540.2s)]
*  And I mean, you know, there is Joseph Massad [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1541.04s)]
*  who has this beautiful book called [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1543.84s)]
*  Islam and Liberalism where he explains this at length. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1545.0s)]
*  But it's important to go back to this [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1548.24s)]
*  because basically European Western liberalism [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1550.0s)]
*  has always projected onto Islam [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1554.52s)]
*  all its most vicious and violent aspects, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1557.52s)]
*  accusing Muslim of being backwards, misogynist, fanatics, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1560.92s)]
*  patriarchal. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1566.72s)]
*  So there is a sort of fixation on Islam, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1567.72s)]
*  which allows to create a picture in turn [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1570.64s)]
*  of liberal values as universal, democratic, progressive. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1574.16s)]
*  Something the world of Muslims should embrace [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1580.3200000000002s)]
*  to come out of their despotic past and violent present. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1583.64s)]
*  I mean, we all know the reason why, for example, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1588.88s)]
*  Afghanistan was invaded under the premise [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1592.0s)]
*  that we needed to liberate and bring freedom [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1594.36s)]
*  to the women of Afghanistan. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1597.7199999999998s)]
*  We know the story about the struggle of women in Iran, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1601.9199999999998s)]
*  which was used and weaponized [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1605.08s)]
*  for a potential regime change operation. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1607.6799999999998s)]
*  And we're seeing now liberal heroes, [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1610.4799999999998s)]
*  Western feminist heroes like Hillary Clinton [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1612.6799999999998s)]
*  condemning Amaz as we were saying about the sexual violence [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1616.12s)]
*  without any proofs whatsoever. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1618.6399999999999s)]
*  Now, liberalism now, the issue with liberalism [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1621.52s)]
*  is that on the one hand has shown its capacity [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1626.04s)]
*  to create this most pictures of Islam and the culture, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1628.84s)]
*  the religion, Islamic culture and the religion of Islam. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1633.92s)]
*  On the other hand, and this is, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1639.16s)]
*  go back to the material element and understanding [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1642.16s)]
*  the importance of the material premise of the ideology [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1644.56s)]
*  is that liberalism has had absolutely no problem [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1648.92s)]
*  to cooperate, collaborate with [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1653.0s)]
*  and fund the most reactionary interpreters of Islam [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1656.44s)]
*  in order to make sure that the material basis required [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1661.68s)]
*  to sustain the imperialist privilege. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1667.0800000000002s)]
*  Again, we go back to this tiny minority, [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1670.1200000000001s)]
*  which is at the premise of the idea of liberalism [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1672.6000000000001s)]
*  as an imperialist element are kept in place. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1677.04s)]
*  So, and this has happened over and over again [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1681.04s)]
*  throughout the history of liberalism. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1684.0s)]
*  It's not unique to the West Asian region, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1685.4399999999998s)]
*  to the Arab region, why? [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1689.36s)]
*  Because you blame and cast the Muslim as monstrous [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1691.12s)]
*  or that's the most terrifying elements of society, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1696.9199999999998s)]
*  yet you fund consistently Wahhabi Islam [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1699.6799999999998s)]
*  that is emanating from the Gulf. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1703.3999999999999s)]
*  And this is very central to undermine [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1705.44s)]
*  this social political project like Pan-Arabism [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1709.3600000000001s)]
*  back in the days that was central [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1712.52s)]
*  to the challenge to imperialism. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1714.6000000000001s)]
*  But this has happened in Europe as well. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1716.0s)]
*  And this is where we cannot understand anything [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1717.96s)]
*  or to better say, we could understand so easily [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1722.48s)]
*  what is happening in Palestine, in the region, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1726.2s)]
*  if we would have a rightful understanding [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1729.0s)]
*  of our own history, why? [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1732.1200000000001s)]
*  Because we know where the moment you mention the word Nazism, [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1733.96s)]
*  the West goes up in shock. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1738.56s)]
*  Okay? [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1741.4s)]
*  But when you look at the progressive historical, [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1742.64s)]
*  cumulative operations that the US has done in Europe [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1748.52s)]
*  and with the Western, with ruling age segments [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1755.16s)]
*  of the elites of Europe in which Nazis were rehabilitated [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1758.3600000000001s)]
*  as liberals, as progressive elements of society [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1763.2s)]
*  in order to fight communism, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1767.0s)]
*  we are seeing exactly the same dynamic at play here. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1770.2s)]
*  What needs to be remained unchallenged [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1774.36s)]
*  is the system of production, the material basis, [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1778.0s)]
*  which is obviously capitalism and imperialism. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1782.24s)]
*  And in this, I have to say, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1786.4399999999998s)]
*  this is precisely where, you know, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1788.32s)]
*  I know in the US is stronger in a way, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1790.68s)]
*  but it's coming to Europe as well. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1792.6000000000001s)]
*  These are false dichotomy existing [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1794.5600000000002s)]
*  between liberalism and fascism. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1797.0s)]
*  Liberals by history, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1801.28s)]
*  I know this is gonna sound crazy probably for many, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1804.28s)]
*  but they are fascist. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1806.92s)]
*  They were a tiny white minority. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1809.2s)]
*  They are the tiny elite of the West [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1811.04s)]
*  that does not want the global South [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1813.6000000000001s)]
*  to change the rules of the game. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1816.64s)]
*  So there is fascism in all this. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1819.52s)]
*  It's a tiny oligarchy controlling everything [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1821.56s)]
*  with absolute power. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1824.52s)]
*  And it is a fundamental point, you know why? [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1826.72s)]
*  Because liberals remain always in the discourse [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1828.84s)]
*  as you were saying, [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1831.32s)]
*  how do they manage to continue to discuss these things [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1832.16s)]
*  and it's on and on? [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1835.2s)]
*  Because they remain in the realm of identity [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1836.48s)]
*  and they divorce any discussion from the material reality. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1839.96s)]
*  So this is why liberalism reproduces itself. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1844.36s)]
*  It calls for an expansion of that elite group. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1848.0s)]
*  Let's bring a Muslim in, let's bring a woman in, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1851.6s)]
*  let's bring a bald guy in, whatever. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1854.28s)]
*  So basically by doing so, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1857.36s)]
*  you're trying to show that you can actually [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1860.12s)]
*  add an expanded circle of privileges, [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1863.04s)]
*  but you make sure at the same time [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1867.28s)]
*  that none of these elements you are bringing in, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1869.96s)]
*  they want to expand that circle even more. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1872.6s)]
*  And this is why there is an historical relevance [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1875.48s)]
*  of socialism in this moment, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1878.72s)]
*  communism and the anti-colonial struggles, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1880.92s)]
*  which have always pushed for a different type [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1883.64s)]
*  of spiritual, ideological and material struggles. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1887.92s)]
*  And the axis of resistance is part of this, [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1891.1200000000001s)]
*  but the West is too liberal to understand that. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1894.28s)]
*  For now, that's Matteo Omar Capasso. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1898.1200000000001s)]
*  Matteo, I wanted to get your reaction to this video [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1902.96s)]
*  of the Chinese ambassador to the UN [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1909.52s)]
*  during these hearings [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1913.3600000000001s)]
*  at the International Court of Justice in The Hague. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1916.24s)]
*  All right, so this was February 22nd, Thursday, [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1919.5600000000002s)]
*  and this is China's representative addressing the ICJ [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1924.28s)]
*  on the consequences of Israeli occupation. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1927.68s)]
*  That's what the Chiron from Al Jazeera says. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1931.08s)]
*  The UNGA resolution 3070 of 1973, I quote, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1934.56s)]
*  reaffirms the legitimacy of the people's struggle [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1943.68s)]
*  for liberation from colonial and foreign domination [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1947.8799999999999s)]
*  and alien subjugation by all available means, [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1951.8799999999999s)]
*  including armed struggle, end of quote. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1957.8400000000001s)]
*  This recognition is also reflected [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1961.8400000000001s)]
*  in international convention. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1965.1200000000001s)]
*  For example, the Arab Convention [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1967.64s)]
*  for Suppressing of Terrorism of 1998 affirms, I quote, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1970.68s)]
*  the right of peoples to combat foreign occupation, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1978.0800000000002s)]
*  aggression by whatever means, including armed struggle [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1982.08s)]
*  in order to liberate their territories [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1987.3999999999999s)]
*  and secure the right to self-determination [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1991.6399999999999s)]
*  and independence, end of quote. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=1995.96s)]
*  So, and China has had some good, [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2001.56s)]
*  efforts at diplomatic, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2012.48s)]
*  but they're still kind of beholden [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2016.08s)]
*  to this two-state kind of framework. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2019.48s)]
*  But that statement right there, [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2023.4399999999998s)]
*  to have a major world power [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2026.1599999999999s)]
*  that is consistently demonized by the West [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2029.76s)]
*  because of its economic strength and power over the West, [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2033.76s)]
*  to reaffirm Palestinians' right to armed self-defense. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2039.28s)]
*  What is the significance of that? [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2045.96s)]
*  What does it tell us about where the rest of the world [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2047.68s)]
*  so demonized by the West is looking at Palestine? [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2051.36s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2055.48s)]
*  This is, I think, this is the core issue here, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2056.32s)]
*  what we're seeing. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2061.64s)]
*  People understand that what's happening in Palestine [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2063.24s)]
*  is outrageous, is unprecedented, and it's a crime. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2067.52s)]
*  But it's not the West that is responding [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2071.92s)]
*  to this call for change, a call to stop these crimes. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2075.32s)]
*  It's actually the West that it's perpetrating them. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2080.7599999999998s)]
*  But at the same time, there are states of the Souths. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2083.64s)]
*  There are different social and political formations [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2087.64s)]
*  from the South that are emerging [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2089.88s)]
*  and they are calling for a different world order, [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2092.48s)]
*  one that is where everybody sits at the table [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2097.32s)]
*  in an equitable manner and in mutually prosperous way. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2100.48s)]
*  Now, what the Chinese representative said today, [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2104.08s)]
*  it's actually, yes, it is inscribed in the United Nations, [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2109.92s)]
*  the resolution in the General Assembly. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2114.32s)]
*  And as all the violations of Israel [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2117.12s)]
*  are inscribed, not even in UN General Assembly resolution, [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2122.96s)]
*  but in UN Security Council resolution, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2128.52s)]
*  but they've never been taken up. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2131.52s)]
*  They've never been enforced. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2134.8s)]
*  So the tools for an equitable world order [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2137.68s)]
*  do exist in a way that is what China is reminding us. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2143.2400000000002s)]
*  But what China is reminding us as well [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2147.68s)]
*  is that the South of the world understands [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2150.0s)]
*  this genocidal killing, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2154.32s)]
*  this appetite for militarism and wars and violence [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2157.4s)]
*  that the West is showing. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2162.0s)]
*  And they understand also that what is happening in Palestine [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2164.52s)]
*  is a colonial struggle. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2169.2s)]
*  And this is where we go back to the liberal condemnation [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2171.88s)]
*  that went like a plague right after October 7th, [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2175.64s)]
*  which was, do you condemn Hamas? [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2180.3599999999997s)]
*  If anybody has pickups a book on anti-colonial history [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2184.0s)]
*  or colonial history, [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2188.4s)]
*  we'll find out that colonized people [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2189.72s)]
*  face an historical necessity, which is self-preservation. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2194.8399999999997s)]
*  They are locked in time for the colonizers. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2200.7999999999997s)]
*  They have no past because they are, [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2205.32s)]
*  this land is ours now. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2207.96s)]
*  They have no future. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2209.44s)]
*  You're not coming back here. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2210.6400000000003s)]
*  You're not gonna have a state. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2212.1600000000003s)]
*  And they are stuck in a present [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2213.88s)]
*  where they need to be consistently crushed [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2215.6000000000004s)]
*  in all ways possible. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2218.92s)]
*  So to regain their humanity, [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2220.88s)]
*  to regain their moral capacities, [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2223.0s)]
*  to regain their spiritual and political consciousness, [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2225.48s)]
*  armed struggle has always been there [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2230.32s)]
*  as one of the many options to face colonialism. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2233.8s)]
*  But nobody wants to talk about colonialism [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2237.92s)]
*  because it would inevitably then justify [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2240.04s)]
*  what is happening. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2242.96s)]
*  It's not just justify, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2244.1200000000003s)]
*  just simply understand that what is happening, [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2245.52s)]
*  it's been a crime that goes back to the 1920s. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2248.0800000000004s)]
*  It continues. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2251.4s)]
*  And there have been different waves of Palestinian factions [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2253.48s)]
*  facing this historical necessity [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2257.88s)]
*  and having to act upon it. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2260.36s)]
*  And China is obviously, [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2263.16s)]
*  I mean, I always say that nobody's doing enough [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2265.12s)]
*  considering the pace and the significance [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2268.04s)]
*  of what is happening right now. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2270.56s)]
*  But it's also indicative if China has done this statement. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2272.84s)]
*  Why? [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2278.16s)]
*  Because China has had an unprincipled, [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2279.0s)]
*  no, sorry, a principled position [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2281.44s)]
*  against, for example, economic sanctions. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2283.8s)]
*  And by not abiding to the numerous sanctions, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2287.36s)]
*  economic forms of war first that the US has imposed [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2293.56s)]
*  on different countries of the global South, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2296.52s)]
*  being done Venezuela, being done Cuba or Iran, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2298.6s)]
*  China structurally and historically [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2303.2400000000002s)]
*  has played a fundamental role in supporting Iran's [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2306.6800000000003s)]
*  political, militarily and economic capacities. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2310.04s)]
*  And these capacities eventually trickle down as well [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2313.52s)]
*  to the axis. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2319.08s)]
*  So we can see historically, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2320.72s)]
*  we can really admire the moment we are living, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2323.24s)]
*  which is a moment where the South has been consistently [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2327.44s)]
*  and community realizing that we need a new world order. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2330.88s)]
*  We need to own this moment [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2334.52s)]
*  and we need to ask for different terms and different rules. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2337.4s)]
*  They are basically showing agency [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2341.72s)]
*  according to the liberals, [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2343.3599999999997s)]
*  but they're not gonna be happy with this type of agency. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2345.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah, it's not the one that they've prescribed. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2349.52s)]
*  Matteo, let's talk a little bit about Yemen [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2354.08s)]
*  and what Ali calls their humanitarian intervention [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2357.52s)]
*  in the Red Sea as a response to Israel's [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2361.04s)]
*  and the US's barbaric genocide and how this is perceived. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2363.24s)]
*  What can you make of Yemen's stance right now? [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2368.3999999999996s)]
*  Yemen, I think is, it is indeed a humanitarian intervention. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2375.16s)]
*  That's the right word. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2379.7999999999997s)]
*  Yemen, inshallah, have stood as the most moral army [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2381.04s)]
*  really in the world, literally. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2389.12s)]
*  Because on the face of the genocide, [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2392.24s)]
*  the world must act to stop these crimes, okay? [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2394.28s)]
*  Because what we're living is unprecedented. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2398.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't need to repeat the numbers of what is happening. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2400.96s)]
*  It's horrifying. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2403.2000000000003s)]
*  Yemen, like many others anyway, [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2405.6400000000003s)]
*  but Yemen has this unique capacity [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2408.6400000000003s)]
*  to magnetize our sense of morality and spirituality. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2413.32s)]
*  Why? [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2419.6400000000003s)]
*  Because Yemen has been under decades of wars, [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2420.48s)]
*  decades. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2424.84s)]
*  It has suffered so much from 2004, then back in 2015. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2425.6800000000003s)]
*  And now we are seeing like live happening right now [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2430.96s)]
*  that the population has suffered for more than 20 years [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2435.2400000000002s)]
*  for foreign US led and Western led war and aggression, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2438.1600000000003s)]
*  raising up to a moral standard that the West has lost. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2441.52s)]
*  It's unimaginable for the West to think that, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2447.4s)]
*  for Western elites, that the poorest people of the world [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2450.1600000000003s)]
*  can come and face this genocide. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2454.6400000000003s)]
*  So again, what does this tell us? [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2456.88s)]
*  And we go back to what you were saying before, Nora, [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2458.7200000000003s)]
*  that this is definitely as a war, [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2460.7200000000003s)]
*  a struggle being led by the South ideologically, [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2468.0s)]
*  morally, militarily, that they want to rewrite [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2472.08s)]
*  the rules of the international order. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2476.12s)]
*  And at the same time, it shows that Palestine [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2479.28s)]
*  is also a war on the poor. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2482.4s)]
*  And that's why everybody understands immediately [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2485.2000000000003s)]
*  that this is a crime, this shouldn't be happening. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2488.04s)]
*  And the poorest people, materially the poorest people [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2491.2400000000002s)]
*  are rising up to face this because they know [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2494.36s)]
*  what it means to be there. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2498.8s)]
*  And they know that there is clearly a challenge [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2500.52s)]
*  faced to their own liberation, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2504.56s)]
*  political, economic, moral, spiritual, [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2506.8s)]
*  and they have to do something. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2509.32s)]
*  And so this naval blockade that they have done, [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2510.84s)]
*  it's literally, it's amazing to see that they have managed [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2513.6800000000003s)]
*  to block a choke point of trade to help Palestine. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2517.2000000000003s)]
*  But obviously the mainstream media is not gonna tell us [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2523.0s)]
*  that this is why it's happening. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2525.32s)]
*  And going back to China, [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2527.28s)]
*  China is being affected by this blockade, [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2528.4s)]
*  but it didn't take an hostile stance [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2531.6400000000003s)]
*  against the resistance. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2534.44s)]
*  Right, I mean, a lot of the goods that come in [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2536.3199999999997s)]
*  through the Red Sea and go to Israel or Israel, [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2539.8399999999997s)]
*  you know, proxies comes from China. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2545.12s)]
*  And yeah, it's interesting to see [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2548.16s)]
*  how that has kind of intensified as well. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2550.68s)]
*  How, you know, the Yemeni government, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2557.04s)]
*  the Yemeni government, Ansar Allah, [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2561.88s)]
*  has been very defiant of US aggression, [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2564.16s)]
*  of aggressive politics, of the saber rattling, [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2571.64s)]
*  of the bombing that the US has done. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2574.68s)]
*  What does that teach us? [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2581.6s)]
*  What do we draw from that? [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2583.4s)]
*  I think what do we draw probably, [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2587.7599999999998s)]
*  I would think like in probably four major points [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2589.72s)]
*  that come to my mind, you know, [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2597.08s)]
*  like at least the first two is that [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2598.16s)]
*  what's happening right now, it's a colonial struggle. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2602.08s)]
*  It's a struggle for liberation. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2606.9199999999996s)]
*  And the moment we set and we understand clearly [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2611.3599999999997s)]
*  what is happening, then everything, [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2616.2799999999997s)]
*  it becomes easier for us. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2620.44s)]
*  Because this is again, it's not Israel-Palestine. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2622.4s)]
*  This is a war of liberation undertaken by the Palestinians [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2626.2s)]
*  in the face of colonialism, [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2631.08s)]
*  which inevitably involves a regional alliance [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2634.56s)]
*  because that's the only way that can happen [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2639.48s)]
*  because the whole region is choked. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2641.2799999999997s)]
*  So you're not going to liberate Palestine [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2645.0s)]
*  through NGO meetings. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2647.4s)]
*  You're going to have, and you're going to need eventually [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2648.68s)]
*  as history has shown us different forms of struggle, [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2651.52s)]
*  including the armed struggle. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2655.6s)]
*  Then this teaches us that the resistance [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2657.7999999999997s)]
*  has developed a capacity to organize themselves, [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2661.3599999999997s)]
*  to stay true to their spiritual, ideological, [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2665.16s)]
*  and moral values by developing a long-term political horizon, [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2668.7999999999997s)]
*  which we have lost in the West. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2674.0s)]
*  Our ruling elites cannot plan the next four years. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2677.32s)]
*  So this struggle is then is the material [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2681.88s)]
*  and ideological obviously. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2687.92s)]
*  And in all this, you realize the importance [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2690.6400000000003s)]
*  of having allies, of acting with other social political forces [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2693.2000000000003s)]
*  because you cannot do this alone. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2700.6800000000003s)]
*  And again, this is so important [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2702.6400000000003s)]
*  because one of the most problematic things [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2704.16s)]
*  that happened into history [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2707.7999999999997s)]
*  was the liquidation of the Palestinian struggle, [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2709.0s)]
*  not as a regional struggle, but as a national one. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2711.24s)]
*  This is just the issue of the Palestinians. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2714.6s)]
*  They will resolve it. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2716.2799999999997s)]
*  It's not, it's just per history's necessity and mandate. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2718.08s)]
*  It's not just a Palestinian struggle. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2722.24s)]
*  It's a regional one. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2724.96s)]
*  And this is becoming so clear. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2727.08s)]
*  What was the aim of the wars of Yemen? [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2729.92s)]
*  What was the aim of the war on Syria? [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2732.56s)]
*  What was the aim on Iran? [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6-10H80Bs&t=2734.44s)]
