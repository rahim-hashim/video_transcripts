Video Description: On episode 46, we speak to representatives of two of six major Palestinian rights groups Israel has recently designated as ‚Äúterrorist‚Äù organizations.
And a human rights activist in Burlington, Vermont, talks about working to encourage the city council to pass a resolution in explicit support of the Palestinian-let boycott, divestment and sanctions movement.
Human rights defenders and top UN experts have denounced Israel‚Äôs defense minister Benny Gantz‚Äôs attack on the six groups.
The groups are Al-Haq, Defense for Children International Palestine, Addameer, ‚Äã‚Äãthe Union of Palestinian Women Committees, the Union of Agricultural Work Committees and the Bisan Center for Research and Development.
Some of their staff have cooperated closely with the International Criminal Court in its war crimes probe in the West Bank and Gaza.
UN special rapporteurs have warned that the Israeli designation would effectively ban the work of the human rights groups. It provides a pretext for Israel to arrest their staff, close their offices and seize their property.
As The Electronic Intifada reported, Israel has long sought to defame and sabotage the work of Palestinian human rights groups seeking an end to Israeli impunity. Senior Israeli figures and lobby groups baselessly accuse these groups of ‚Äúweaponizing‚Äù the ICC against the US and Israel.
Aseel AlBajeh, legal researcher and advocacy officer at Al-Haq, tells The Electronic Intifada Podcast that this designation is part of a coordinated and decades-long campaign of repression against the Palestinian people.
Al-Haq, one of the oldest Arab human rights organizations, monitors Israel‚Äôs human rights violations.
According to AlBajeh, the designation ‚Äúrepresents an escalated attack.‚Äù
‚ÄúHow we respond to that is that our struggle as the Palestinian people will not stop with these failed attempts to silence our voices ‚Ä¶ we do need the international community and the global human rights movement to stand with us,‚Äù AlBajeh explains, adding that she and her colleagues at Al-Haq know they face threats of arrest, residency revocation and confiscation of assets.
Milena Ansari, international advocacy officer at Addameer, a group that advocates for the rights of Palestinian prisoners, tells The Electronic Intifada Podcast that as long as powerful governments and institutions stay silent regarding Israel‚Äôs human rights abuses, Israel will continue to try and stamp out civil society groups.
‚ÄúWhen Israel feels that the work of human rights organizations is really taking action, and maybe is asking [for] accountability in a strong voice, they start attacking in bizarre and arbitrary measures ‚Äì such as designating our legitimate human rights work as ‚Äòterrorist,‚Äô‚Äù Ansari says.
‚ÄúWe do also have to let the international community know that now is the time to actually stand up with the six ‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs not only these six organizations, we‚Äôre saying the Palestinian people as a whole,‚Äù she adds.
Meanwhile, in Burlington, Vermont, more than two dozen left-wing groups have been working to push their city council to pass a resolution in support of Palestinian rights and the Palestinian-led BDS campaign.
Israel lobby groups used heavy smear tactics to derail the campaign in September, including attempts to brand the BDS movement and the resolution itself as ‚Äúanti-Semitic.‚Äù
Under that pressure, the city council ultimately withdrew the resolution ‚Äì but it was not defeated outright.
Wafic Faour of Vermonters for Justice in Palestine tells The Electronic Intifada Podcast that while the campaign continues, he has pertinent advice to other activists working on similar resolutions around the US.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ever lose hope,‚Äù Faour says. ‚ÄúAt the end, we‚Äôre going to win. If we want to talk about justice and human rights, history is on our side.‚Äù
The action of bringing this debate to the city, he says, ‚Äúis a victory. Because even the local newspapers and the local TV covered this occasion completely differently from what our opponents wished. We had the space, for the first time, to say what we believe and how the future will look like to build a peaceful community here and back in Palestine.‚Äù

*  Welcome back to the electronic intifada podcast. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=40.92s)]
*  Israel's designation of six major Palestinian rights groups as quote terrorist organizations [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=43.8s)]
*  on October 22nd has elicited an immediate and strong response from human rights defenders. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=49.32s)]
*  The human rights organizations in Israel jointly condemned the move which was announced by [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=56.919999999999995s)]
*  Israeli defense minister Benny Gantz as a quote act of cowardice that is quote characteristic [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=60.839999999999996s)]
*  of repressive authoritarian regimes. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=66.8s)]
*  They called on the international community to quote oppose this decision unequivocally. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=69.96s)]
*  The human rights groups Al Haq, Defense for Children International Palestine, Ademir, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=75.36s)]
*  the Union of Palestinian Women's Committees, the Union of Agricultural Work Committees [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=80.36s)]

*  UN special rapporteurs have warned that the Israeli designation would effectively ban [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=94.26s)]
*  the work of the human rights groups. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=99.42s)]
*  It provides a pretext for Israel to arrest their staff, close their offices and seize [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=102.80000000000001s)]
*  their property. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  As the electronic Intifada has reported, Israel has long sought to defame and sabotage the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=109.82s)]
*  work of Palestinian human rights groups seeking to end Israeli impunity while senior Israeli [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=115.22s)]
*  figures and lobby groups baselessly accuse these groups of quote weaponizing the ICC [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=121.53999999999999s)]
*  against the US and Israel. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=127.41999999999999s)]
*  Today we're speaking with representatives of two of the six Palestinian human rights [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=130.01999999999998s)]
*  groups Asil Abajay, legal researcher and advocacy officer at Al Haq and Milena Ansari. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=133.7s)]
*  International advocacy officer at Ademir, Asil and Milena. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=140.38s)]
*  Thank you so much for being with us on the Electronic Intifada podcast. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=144.62s)]
*  Thank you for hosting us. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=150.06s)]
*  Of course, Asil, let's begin with you. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=151.94s)]
*  Much of the work that Al Haq does centers around documenting Israeli war crimes and [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=155.58s)]
*  trying to hold Israel to account. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=160.34s)]
*  Tell us about that work and give us a sense of what this designation by Benny Gantz aims [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=162.70000000000002s)]
*  to do to your organization. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=167.62s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=170.74s)]
*  So we've actually been operating in the occupied Palestinian territory since 40 years, 42 [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=171.74s)]
*  years now. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=178.38s)]
*  And since the 70s, the organization has been documenting and monitoring the human rights [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=179.74s)]
*  situation as well as documentation to do advocacy work in various ways, including at [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=186.62s)]
*  International Criminal Court, as you mentioned, but also at the United Nations level with [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=197.66s)]
*  the special procedures at the Human Rights Council and with policymakers to try to push [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=205.06s)]
*  that Israel ends its illegal apartheid regime and military occupation against the Palestinian [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=210.42000000000002s)]
*  people. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=218.5s)]
*  In terms of what does this designation mean to us as Al Haq, but also as the Palestinian [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=220.42s)]
*  civil society and human rights defenders and also as the Palestinian people as a whole, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=226.78s)]
*  because this represent an escalated attack within institutionalized and ongoing efforts [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=231.06s)]
*  to silence any efforts seeking to challenge basically Israel's crimes and violations [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=236.98s)]
*  against the Palestinian people. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=243.82s)]
*  Civil society groups, including Al Haq in Palestine, seek to amplify what is going on [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=245.5s)]
*  on the ground and advocate for a better future for the Palestinian people. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=253.58s)]
*  So we see it as part of the whole repression of the Palestinian people. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=258.46000000000004s)]
*  But also our work has been also subjected to smear campaigns and intimidation by the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=262.42s)]
*  Israeli occupying authorities since decades now, including death threats for individuals [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=268.46000000000004s)]
*  at Al Haq, for example, related to our work at the International Criminal Court, but also [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=274.21999999999997s)]
*  arbitrary arrests. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=280.62s)]
*  I think Melina can highlight more on that and the fact that we are also subjected to [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=282.06s)]
*  residents revocation. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=286.94s)]
*  So this is part of an institutionalized effort to silence any effort, as I said. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=288.65999999999997s)]
*  How do we respond to that is that our struggle as the Palestinian people will not stop with [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=295.94s)]
*  these failed attempts to silence our voices. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=303.42s)]
*  We nonetheless are subjected to threats of being arrested and for our assets to be also [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=309.18s)]
*  confiscated as well. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=318.86s)]
*  So we do need the international community and the global human rights movement to stand [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=320.54s)]
*  with us. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=328.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=330.86s)]
*  And Melina, talk about the work at Ademir, which advocates for the rights of Palestinian [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=332.34000000000003s)]
*  prisoners. As Asil mentioned, in 2019, your offices in Ramallah were raided and computer [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=337.46000000000004s)]
*  equipment was seized by Israeli occupation forces. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=343.82s)]
*  The same thing happened to Defense for Children International Palestine's offices just weeks [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=346.74s)]
*  ago. Ademir has been under constant attack by Israel, as all the five other groups have [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=351.18s)]
*  been. Tell us about Ademir and how this designation is designed to stop your work. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=358.26s)]
*  Yes, thank you. To begin with, Ademir Prisoner Support and Human Rights Association is a [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=366.34s)]
*  Palestinian non-governmental association that provides free legal aid to Palestinian [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=373.09999999999997s)]
*  political prisoners held both in Israeli prisons and under the Palestinian authorities [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=379.5s)]
*  prisons. We also advocate for the rights of Palestinian prisoners on an international [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=386.54s)]
*  and a national level. The documentation unit at Ademir through their prison visits and [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=392.54s)]
*  legal files and cases, they have documented systematic and arbitrary policies by the [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=400.70000000000005s)]
*  Israeli prison services against the Palestinian prisoners, such as medical neglect, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=407.5s)]
*  arbitrary collective punishment, isolation, and many other arbitrary and harsh ill treatment [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=413.74s)]
*  in prisons. As you mentioned, Ademir has been a target of this Israeli-led attacks for [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=420.46s)]
*  many years. This is an attack that has been ongoing by harassments of, as Asil mentioned, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=429.42s)]
*  residency revocation, arbitrary arrests under administrative detention, which means without [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=436.54s)]
*  any charges or without any trial for an indefinite time. So this has been an escalation for [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=442.86s)]
*  a long time. During the raid in 2019, Ademir was taking on cases of torture where detainees [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=450.38s)]
*  were subjected to extreme torture techniques against them during interrogation. One of them, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=460.78000000000003s)]
*  within 48 hours, he was taken to the hospital and under critical, his life was at imminent risk. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=470.3s)]
*  So when Israel feels that the work of human rights organizations is really taking action and maybe [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=479.34s)]
*  is asking accountability in a strong voice, they start attacking in bizarre and arbitrary measures [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=487.97999999999996s)]
*  such as the decision of designating our legitimate human rights work as terrorists. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=495.58s)]
*  This is absolutely bizarre, but this is truly not surprising because the international community has [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=506.62s)]
*  been silent with everything that has been going on. Shada Odeh, the director of the health work [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=513.5s)]
*  committees, is now in detention under ill and arbitrary conditions and she's the director of [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=521.58s)]
*  the health work committees. The world stayed silent when she was arbitrarily arrested just [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=529.74s)]
*  because Israel decided that the health work committees is an unlawful organization and they [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=535.26s)]
*  get to completely shut down a legitimate Palestinian providing public services to [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=540.7s)]
*  vulnerable communities. So we do also have to let the international community know that [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=548.7s)]
*  now is the time to actually stand up with the six and when we say six, it's not only the six [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=556.7s)]
*  organizations, we're saying the Palestinian people as a whole. Sorry, just to one thing, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=563.4200000000001s)]
*  when we keep demanding Israel to revoke this decision, we're also empowering it to have more [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=570.5400000000001s)]
*  control over us. Is it by day and night they decide who's a terrorist organization and who's [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=577.18s)]
*  not, depending on how far they're getting in the international community? So this must end, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=583.5799999999999s)]
*  we must not bow down to this harassment and bullying. Yeah, thank you. UN human rights [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=590.38s)]
*  experts warned that, quote, this designation is a frontal attack on the Palestinian human rights [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=598.14s)]
*  movement and on human rights everywhere. Can you talk a little bit more about the ramifications [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=603.9s)]
*  of this designation? I mean, Ademir, for example, advocates for Palestinian political prisoners. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=610.62s)]
*  As you mentioned, some of its officers have been arbitrarily arrested and detained. At this point, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=618.38s)]
*  does a designation like this leave you and Asil and members and staff of these organizations [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=625.5s)]
*  vulnerable to arrest and administrative detention at this point? What could happen? What are you [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=635.5s)]
*  expecting? You know, this answer could, my answer could come in different aspects. We're talking [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=647.0200000000001s)]
*  about the defunding from the sponsors. We're talking about isolating the work of Palestinian [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=656.86s)]
*  civil society organizations from the global community. We're talking about the international [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=663.0200000000001s)]
*  community questioning the credibility or not. This is why we see the public statements as [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=669.1800000000001s)]
*  motivation that this part of a threat is not really happening on ground. But what I mean to [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=675.98s)]
*  say, but the defunding of sponsors and organizations that have always supported the work of [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=681.9s)]
*  the Palestinian civil society organizations, like Ademir, for instance, this was not following the [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=690.0600000000001s)]
*  decision. But two weeks before one of our core donors did not renew the contract for additional [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=695.9s)]
*  sponsors due to political pressures, as they clearly stated. So, you know, sometimes international [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=704.94s)]
*  organizations do bow to these false accusations and other times they publish statements where [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=712.5400000000001s)]
*  they say there are no bases, there are no substantial evidence regarding all that. We [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=722.1400000000001s)]
*  still stand and we do know that this is legitimate human rights work. So, you know, arbitrary arrests [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=727.9000000000001s)]
*  are definitely an imminent risk at all employees, even the directors. This is not something that [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=734.14s)]
*  is bizarre by the Israeli occupation. As I mentioned, Shadaa Odeh is in prison [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=741.34s)]
*  still and she's a 61-year-old woman. So, no one is exempt from the threats that are happening. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=746.62s)]
*  Yeah, Asil, what's your response to that? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=755.26s)]
*  Yeah, adding to what Melina said, I think there's the individual level of how these designations, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=759.34s)]
*  what the consequences are, but there is also the collective kind of impact on our work. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=766.7800000000001s)]
*  And as Melina said, I'd just like to highlight that also these designations come under Israel's [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=772.0600000000001s)]
*  domestic law that is illegally applied into the occupied territory. And this law is basically [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=777.98s)]
*  vague in its definitions and it can apply basically from five to 25 years of prison terms [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=784.78s)]
*  to the staff of our organizations. So, this is on an individual level of how this will impact us. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=793.1s)]
*  But I think also on the symbolic nature of our work as well. So, for example, we do also kind of [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=801.26s)]
*  collective work, joint work together as an organization. Melina and myself are actually, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=811.6600000000001s)]
*  we're actually been working on advocating the rights of Palestinians in Beita in Nablus, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=816.86s)]
*  which since May they have been protesting an unlawful settlement that was placed on their land [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=825.34s)]
*  illegally. And since then, what the Israeli occupying authorities have done is killing the [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=831.74s)]
*  protesters, the civilians and injuring the civilians. There are now seven Palestinians [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=837.6600000000001s)]
*  killed in Beita only since May. And Al-Dameer, for example, has been also documenting the arrests [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=844.3000000000001s)]
*  in this area where it doesn't have been illegally and arbitrarily arrested as well. So, this is the [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=850.86s)]
*  kind of work we do. And unfortunately, the Israeli authorities have distracted us from the work that [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=855.98s)]
*  we do. Instead of us now advocating for this, this is just an example of course, the Beita case, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=865.34s)]
*  but instead of us working to advocate for and protection of the rights of people in Beita, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=872.38s)]
*  we are now countering and trying to protect ourselves as well from this arbitrary and [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=877.6600000000001s)]
*  unlawful designation. Yeah, that's part of it, right? I mean, that's how Israel lobby groups [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=883.5s)]
*  here in the US and North America, they go after human rights defenders. They try and tie up their [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=890.94s)]
*  time and resources and finances in court and legal proceedings in order to get them to stop the work [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=899.9000000000001s)]
*  that they're doing. There was a diplomatic briefing on Wednesday by representatives of the six groups [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=906.62s)]
*  calling for immediate intervention to defend Palestinian human rights organizations and staff. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=917.9s)]
*  And as I mentioned, Rajah Shahadeh, the founder of Al-Haq, said recently, the fact that Al-Haq [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=925.5s)]
*  and other rights groups have supplied evidence of war crimes by Benny Gantz himself [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=932.3s)]
*  to the International Criminal Court is a very probable reason Gantz made this declaration. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=937.18s)]
*  What can you say about Gantz's personal connection to declaring Al-Haq and Abdamir and the others as [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=942.86s)]
*  terrorist organizations and the way that Israel itself through the last 73 years has been attempting [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=950.4599999999999s)]
*  to silence and attack any international body that could enact consequences for the entire Israeli project? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=956.78s)]
*  Yes, there is absolutely a connection between the decision and the advocacy on an international [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=963.74s)]
*  level, especially the International Criminal Court. Both our organizations and the DCI and other [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=974.78s)]
*  Palestinian civil society organizations are doing legal documentation to the ICC after their [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=982.54s)]
*  decision to open an investigation. Abdamir is representing three victims before the ICC [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=991.02s)]
*  who are children, prisoner children, who were transferred illegally inside the occupying [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=998.62s)]
*  territory, which is illegal under international law and international criminal law. And then DCIP [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1005.74s)]
*  is also representing victims before the ICC as well as Al-Haq has many documentation regarding [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1013.42s)]
*  the systematic and widespread attacks and crimes against humanity that Israeli occupation [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1021.8199999999999s)]
*  is doing on ground. So it is completely true. And since the decision of opening the investigation, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1030.62s)]
*  it seems like things are moving on in the international community regarding the ICC. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1038.46s)]
*  So we believe, as Asil mentioned, it is a distraction for our work. There is so many [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1045.82s)]
*  violations of human rights that are being documented. And instead of following up on [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1054.38s)]
*  that or prosecuting and asking for accountability regarding these crimes, we're here advocating [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1059.82s)]
*  all together jointly to defend what Israel is crying wolf about and the international community [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1066.06s)]
*  is just watching to see what secret evidence there is. This is completely bizarre at this point. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1073.5s)]
*  Asil, did you want to add to that? [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1083.58s)]
*  Yeah, I can only say that we also see this as like a failed attempt after several [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1087.1799999999998s)]
*  years and decades of smearing campaigns and intimidations to Palestinian civil society [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1094.62s)]
*  organizations and human rights defenders. Like Israel have failed to challenge our work based on [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1101.26s)]
*  and on evidence or on law. So now it is trying to criminalize the whole Palestinian civil society [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1108.3799999999999s)]
*  work. And it is indeed related to our work towards accountability. But also there's [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1117.66s)]
*  widespread and mounting recognition of Israel as an apartheid regime as well by [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1125.9s)]
*  states and by the United Nations and by global civil society. So this is kind of intimidating Israel [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1132.5400000000002s)]
*  to eliminate any voice trying to expose its crimes or efforts seeking accountability basically. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1142.22s)]
*  Finally, what are the next steps for your organizations now and what can people around [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1155.02s)]
*  the world do to make their voices heard at the international level? I know that in terms of [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1160.14s)]
*  even financial support, it's almost impossible for people here in the US and in Europe to [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1166.54s)]
*  donate via PayPal or anything like that because Israel has completely banned the use of [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1174.54s)]
*  monetary exchange platforms to support your work. What can people do right now? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1182.86s)]
*  Yeah, mobilize, take action. And most importantly, you know, I'm not trying to advertise or what not. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1190.62s)]
*  You need to follow the sources, which are the six organizations. We are calling for actions daily. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1200.3s)]
*  We are calling for stands and rallies, actions for specific organizations or for individuals [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1207.58s)]
*  or for politicians. And, you know, we're trying as much as possible to allow the international community [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1216.62s)]
*  to take its role regarding what's happening right now. So now is the time to really wake up and take [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1225.34s)]
*  action, whether it is with statements or speaking up to your parliamentarians, your elected officials. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1233.02s)]
*  These are the specific, more the broader demands. I think, Asil, if you'd like to add to that, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1241.5s)]
*  but it's important to really not think or take this lightly. Arbitrary measures will come [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1249.58s)]
*  escalating after this. So we do need to take action as soon as possible. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1258.78s)]
*  Yeah, I can only add that we are at risk at now, so we need protection and protections come from action. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1263.82s)]
*  And as Melina said, one way to do so is to pressure policymakers by like individually, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1274.3s)]
*  individuals can pressure their policymakers to call on Israel to end this designation and also to revoke [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1281.02s)]
*  the law itself. And any effort basically that Israel does to silence Palestinian resistance and [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1289.8999999999999s)]
*  and voices against its violations. In relation to donors, I would say that this is [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1302.1399999999999s)]
*  and donors, but also the international community who is supporting Palestinian civil society. This [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1308.6999999999998s)]
*  is the time because we've been repeating the same demands since decades in relation to different [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1313.4199999999998s)]
*  violations that Israel has done over the since decades. But now is the time to actually act on [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1319.26s)]
*  their international obligations to pressure Israel to end the whole illegal situation [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1331.34s)]
*  against the Palestinian people as a whole. Asil Abajay from Al Haq and Melina Ansari from [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1337.58s)]
*  Ademir. Thank you so much for all the work that you both do and the work of your colleagues. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1346.7s)]
*  We will have links up on the Electronic and Fada blog post that accompanies this podcast [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1353.5800000000002s)]
*  so people can check out more of your work and learn more about your organization and how you're [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1358.6200000000001s)]
*  fighting back and fighting for the rights of Palestinians. Thank you both so much and please [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1362.78s)]
*  be safe. We'll check back with you soon. I'm Nora Barrows-Freedman and welcome back to the [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1369.74s)]
*  Electronic and Fada podcast. Over the years, activists around the U.S. have organized to pass [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1375.9s)]
*  resolutions in support of Palestinian rights via their local city councils and have faced attacks [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1381.66s)]
*  by the Israel lobby. Today we're looking at a particular case in Burlington, Vermont, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1388.14s)]
*  where for months more than two dozen leftist groups have worked to get their city council to [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1393.8200000000002s)]
*  pass a resolution in explicit support of the Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1398.94s)]
*  campaign, which would make it the first U.S. city to do so. As blogger Richard Silverstein writes, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1404.62s)]
*  during the campaign, the groups worked tirelessly to gain the support of city council members. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1411.9799999999998s)]
*  They secured the support of seven of 12 members and believed they were assured of victory, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1417.34s)]
*  but they didn't count on the overwhelming firepower of the local and national Israel lobby. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1422.54s)]
*  It pulled out all the stops flooding their council offices with up to 2,000 text and email [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1427.8999999999999s)]
*  messages, letters, and phone calls denouncing the resolution as anti-Semitic. Joining us to talk [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1433.18s)]
*  about this resolution, what the next steps for it are and the importance of organizing such a [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1439.42s)]
*  campaign is Wafiq Faur of Vermonters for Justice in Palestine. Wafiq, thank you so much for being [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1444.6200000000001s)]
*  with us on the Electronic and Fada podcast. Oh, thank you, Nora. And good to see you again. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1450.22s)]
*  Yes, likewise. So talk about this resolution. The Israel lobby claimed that it was easily defeated, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1456.14s)]
*  but it actually isn't over yet. Can you talk about what the resolution says and its next steps? [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1464.78s)]
*  I think the resolution, it was a clear of our demand of withdrawal of Israel from occupied Arab [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1471.58s)]
*  land, what we mean 1967 lands that include Golan Heights, respecting the human and equal rights of [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1481.26s)]
*  Palestinian Israeli citizens and in the apartheid laws in Israel. And lastly, respecting [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1490.3s)]
*  American citizens who observe and call for BDS, which stands for Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1502.46s)]
*  Nora, we wrote this resolution and we worked on it prior to a success we have here in Vermont and [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1512.06s)]
*  city of Burlington that we forced Ben and Jerry after almost a decade of activism to come with a [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1524.78s)]
*  statement called for the end of their business in Israel and occupied territory. And [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1536.38s)]
*  both occasions came together because it was July 19th, the statement came out. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1549.0200000000002s)]
*  We introduced our resolution after work with many people, mainly the committee within the city, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1556.5400000000002s)]
*  that it's called the racial equity, inclusion and belonging on the 20th, on the evening. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1566.94s)]
*  So it's the second day exactly. After hearing within the committee and passing at the first [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1576.38s)]
*  meeting, we went to second meeting of the same committee. Our supporters came in and it was [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1584.8600000000001s)]
*  international news because the second day there were a lot of journalists, including Israeli [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1595.5s)]
*  journalists from channel 13. I took him to the meeting, so it was over three days in news in [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1602.3799999999999s)]
*  Israel as well. Contrary to our local Jewish siblings who says that they didn't know about it. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1611.5s)]
*  Because they were in the same program like us. We didn't hide anything. Our call was very clear, [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1624.86s)]
*  mainly on respect of human rights and equal rights to the Palestinian people as well. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1633.6599999999999s)]
*  After it passed committee, we had no control of the calendar, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1639.5s)]
*  ourselves. It is parliamentarian calendar. So from the committee went to the full council on [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1645.9s)]
*  September 13th, Monday, September 13th. Now, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1656.54s)]
*  the local Zionist supporters of Israel, they came out with two kinds of attack. One, they called us [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1661.26s)]
*  anti-Semitic and unsensitive because we brought such resolution on high holiday of our Jewish [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1676.54s)]
*  siblings between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. We are trying to single out Israel. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1685.58s)]
*  Frankly, we worked very hard because we thought it is timely. Not because [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1700.54s)]
*  we like to exercise our rights, which is we have all the right to do it timely because [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1707.8999999999999s)]
*  we built on it over the years. This is not the first time we wrote a resolution. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1715.5s)]
*  We did it before, but 10 years ago, 11 years ago, it was no taker. As a matter of fact, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1721.98s)]
*  the only interested person, council member then, it was from the Republican party. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1728.6200000000001s)]
*  We didn't call for BDS then, but at the same time, he told me, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1737.1000000000001s)]
*  go and talk to the left. If they accepted, I'm accepting it. This time, we called every [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1744.14s)]
*  member of the council and we sent the resolution. We talked to our progressive members within the [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1751.18s)]
*  Burlington City Council. We had success with six of them and one independent who became [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1757.82s)]
*  the sponsor of the resolution. Now, all this talk and we send the resolution to the lawyers of the [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1766.7s)]
*  city to make a comparison, what is the effect on the city? Because we didn't call the city [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1775.26s)]
*  for divestment. We called the respect of boycott divestment sanctions. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1780.78s)]
*  It has been sent to the mayor too. All through this time, we didn't hear anything. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1787.74s)]
*  Friday before Monday, when the council supposed to meet four of our local rabbis, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1795.74s)]
*  they came with a statement in our local newspaper attacking the resolution. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1803.74s)]
*  Immediately after, we saw hundreds of email going to the council member and [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1812.46s)]
*  the mayor to reject it. There was a huge pressure to the sponsor council member, Ali Jiang, [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1821.98s)]
*  to withdraw before it comes to Monday. We rejected all that. We felt that some of the council members [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1831.9s)]
*  start to stop answering our calls. We felt the people who answered our calls, they told us about [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1841.42s)]
*  this emails coming from all over the United States. It was two kind of letters that later we discovered [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1849.42s)]
*  they came from Israeli lobbying groups like ICANN and ADL, the Anti-Diffamation League. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1860.3s)]
*  The second surprise, some of the rabbis who attacked the resolution are people we meet [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1874.86s)]
*  on other occasions because we are not working here on the Palestinian question. We build [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1883.4199999999998s)]
*  Palestinian question through social and racial work on the ground. We sometimes see many members [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1889.98s)]
*  of the Jewish congregations and synagogues standing up with the migrants. We bring the subjects we are [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1900.6200000000001s)]
*  migrants to. They stand with the Black Lives Matters. We brought the apartheid racism existed [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1908.54s)]
*  on Israel against the southern wall. We talk about the wall they are building over there, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1918.54s)]
*  environmentalists, about what's happening in our water over there and the shoreline. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1926.86s)]
*  All our issues are the same issues we are fighting here in the United States. We put a comparison [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1935.42s)]
*  between the inequity, the racial divide we are living here on education, on healthcare, [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1943.9s)]
*  on housing and in the judicial system. We make a comparison based on a lot of studies [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1956.6200000000001s)]
*  taken place by Human Rights Watch, by Israeli human rights [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1968.14s)]
*  organization like Petzalem, like Damir and others. We were not blindfolded when we went there. We [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1978.46s)]
*  were not adventure. We got seven votes that they read the resolution. Nobody brought the [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1986.94s)]
*  subject of anti-Jewish or anti-Semitism because us too we are fighting against [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=1995.1s)]
*  anti-Semitism. We too we are fighting against Islamophobia and any kind of racism. So nobody [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2003.6599999999999s)]
*  brought that issue that including the mayor who came in in a statement against [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2015.4199999999998s)]
*  the resolution Monday at noon. So we know even if we have the seven that we didn't have a majority [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2021.1s)]
*  proof even though we were banking on another two votes from the Democratic caucus that they were [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2033.34s)]
*  not decided and they want to talk more about it, they want to study it. But we were not [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2042.54s)]
*  sure that the subject of Palestinian human rights and equal rights and our rights as American citizens [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2048.78s)]
*  it will be respected in the city. Before we went into the city hall we had a huge rally, I mean over [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2059.9s)]
*  450 people and we went to the city hall but 10 minutes after six when the rally we learned one [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2072.1400000000003s)]
*  of the greatest supporter within the council she's not going to show up. So we know our situation is [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2079.5s)]
*  in a shaky ground because she was very sick. But we entered over there and the council who sponsored [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2086.7000000000003s)]
*  our resolution said I am under so much pressure to pull it out and I've been called left and right [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2094.3s)]
*  about it and frankly he told me he's scared for his family, for his daughter, for his well-being. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2101.58s)]
*  I mean he told me things that he didn't tell anybody like traveling in Tuesday overseas [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2109.9s)]
*  and people will tell him oh have a nice trip. So it was he felt it like his life is a burden [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2116.38s)]
*  but we insisted that we need the debate. The debate is necessary. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2123.8199999999997s)]
*  And it is going to happen is that right? Do you have a date for when that? [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2130.38s)]
*  No it took place that evening. I mean it started 7 30 we left the city hall at two o'clock in the [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2137.1s)]
*  morning. So the debate happened and the people who were forcing our council member the sponsor [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2146.3s)]
*  at the end even though we were two to one and you can go to the video you can see the difference. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2157.98s)]
*  The difference is what we are living now. You have a mixed people who look like the future of this [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2166.7s)]
*  country coming from all walks of life with all the colors possible standing with us standing with the [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2177.18s)]
*  Palestinian human rights and equal rights for racial justice too and you have older generation [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2185.58s)]
*  of Zionist Jewish they repeated the same thing that bringing this issue during the holy days [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2193.18s)]
*  it's antisemitic and they called us all names possible and we were two to one on that but [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2203.66s)]
*  the at the end they insisted our opponents on the council to put things to the vote [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2213.34s)]
*  and when we know our numbers are not sufficient even to vote for and we are threatened by veto [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2222.3s)]
*  we ask our council member to pull it out and we will bring it in another day and the vote can tell [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2231.9s)]
*  you this is the outcome because the six vote voted to pull it out and not to shelf it and [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2239.42s)]
*  our opponents they had five votes so how to describe this absolutely we didn't win the [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2253.1800000000003s)]
*  resolution we hoped for but they lost they lost the vote they wished for [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2258.7000000000003s)]
*  because they call it we want to put everybody in record and they made the whole debate [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2266.22s)]
*  antisemitism so we are preparing now for the next round we are in contact with the same council [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2274.22s)]
*  members and we're going through education and we can talk about it more. Thanks for that and [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2284.54s)]
*  you know the way that these Israel lobby groups are attacking people who stand up for Palestinian [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2296.46s)]
*  rights of course you know this like very well-worn smear campaign of antisemitism [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2307.82s)]
*  you know when it has absolutely nothing to do with acts of bigotry against Jews how [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2315.5s)]
*  how do activists fight that how you know what are what's the advice that you can give to activists [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2322.6200000000003s)]
*  who are you know considering this kind of campaign to get their local city council to [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2329.7400000000002s)]
*  act you know you know for Palestinian rights or to support BDS how what do you say to activists [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2337.26s)]
*  who are like oh god if I'm going to be you know smeared as an anti-semite [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2346.14s)]
*  by these very powerful lobby groups what's you know what's the point I might as well not [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2351.98s)]
*  not even try what do you say to them I I think as a Palestinian I will say we are now on different [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2358.22s)]
*  place so don't don't ever lose hope of what will happen on the future I mean the future with us [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2369.34s)]
*  and at the end we're going to win because of [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2378.54s)]
*  if we want to talk about justice and human rights the history on our side [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2388.3s)]
*  is very important so don't be shaken by these results as a matter of fact I want other cities [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2393.98s)]
*  and communities to take over this resolution and we can help them to hear from here from Vermont [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2405.26s)]
*  to do it we didn't we kept it local we tried even not to bring religious figures even though [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2414.1400000000003s)]
*  faith-based organization were supporting us because we don't want to make it religious [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2422.14s)]
*  they brought four rabbis and as a matter of fact my biggest surprise at the end the last speaker [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2427.98s)]
*  who gave testimony he was a Jewish rabbi David Friedman from Natour Kariet we call it in Arabic [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2437.3399999999997s)]
*  even though they are minority but I believe he came from he's not from Burlington definitely [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2449.9s)]
*  what I'm going to say the action itself to bring this debate to a city or to any municipality [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2458.14s)]
*  by itself it's a victory because even the local newspapers and the local tv they covered this [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2468.38s)]
*  occasion completely different than what our opponents wished we had a space for the first time [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2479.26s)]
*  to say what we believe and how the future going to look like to build a peaceful community here [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2489.1s)]
*  and back on Palestine Israel so the action itself is a victory and we will never accept that it's a [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2497.58s)]
*  defeat you know as a matter of fact they wish that the vote will be against us and second day [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2507.26s)]
*  they will say Burlington rejecting pds Burlington is not rejecting pds you know the other thing is [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2513.82s)]
*  we are facing attack and now it's specific based on a strategy like let's say using [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2524.38s)]
*  the holidays as excuse as an attack as an anti-semitic I learned later it's the only other [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2533.5s)]
*  resolution and it didn't come to the city of Cambridge from activists or as we call them bd [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2541.1800000000003s)]
*  bd assas it came from three council members to boycott hp you know [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2547.8999999999996s)]
*  bullet packer yeah yeah the the the first excuse was they shouldn't have brought it to the council [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2558.54s)]
*  on the holiday and they created holiday I mean they they're going to bring holiday because we have [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2566.62s)]
*  only 365 days a year and you're going to find holiday or commemoration on every day on every [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2572.3s)]
*  week because of a long history of our Jewish siblings so our opponents using that but here [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2582.46s)]
*  in Burlington the strongest supporters we have are from our Jewish community too so don't forget [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2592.7000000000003s)]
*  that this is one two I heard from so many personally I received calls from members of [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2601.1s)]
*  the synagogues that they are revolting against it before the statement of the rabbis came in [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2609.8199999999997s)]
*  and after that as a matter of fact if you read the statement the signatures of the statements the [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2617.66s)]
*  four rabbis they signed only their names as a rabbi of such congregation but not by the boards [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2623.66s)]
*  because many boards rejected and if you read the forward article about what happened many other [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2633.1s)]
*  rabbis rejected to sign on it so we are in the right direction because at the end us the palestinians [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2640.22s)]
*  and the whole people support us and the Jewish community we're going to live forever I mean [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2647.34s)]
*  this is not a selective choice this is our future together so at the end I believe us and [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2655.26s)]
*  many many younger generation from our Jewish siblings we're going to come to a conclusion [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEYpgVd3Ss&t=2666.1400000000003s)]
