Video Description: Once a Beltway neoconservative, Tucker Carlson came to embody the angry, forgotten white man—railing at “the élites” and propagating racist conspiracy theories and the lie of the stolen election. “Unlike a lot of his colleagues at Fox News, he made news, he set the agenda,” Kelefa Sanneh, who wrote about Carlson in 2017 (https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/10/tucker-carlsons-fighting-words), says. “People were wondering, What is Tucker going to be saying tonight?” Sanneh joins Andrew Marantz (https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/andrew-marantz) and David Remnick to discuss Carlson’s demise, and what comes next. And Clare Malone reports on Candace Owens (https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-communications/the-gospel-of-candace-owens), the powerful right-wing influencer and provocateur who’s set her sights on the future of right-wing media—and on a younger and more female audience than that of Fox News.

# The Fall of Tucker Carlson, and the Making of Candace Owens
**New Yorker Radio Hour:** [May 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI)
*  This is the New Yorker Radio Hour, a co-production of WNYC Studios and The New Yorker. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome to the New Yorker Radio Hour. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  I'm David Rennick. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=14.52s)]
*  A couple of decades ago, a modestly talented writer of outsized ego named Tucker Carlson [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=16.64s)]
*  appeared on the scene. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=23.16s)]
*  He was a bow tie wearing conservative writing wise ass profiles of George Bush and Hillary [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=24.76s)]
*  Clinton and the like, but he became over time the voice of the aging angry white man. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=31.400000000000002s)]
*  The voice of white nationalism and extremist politics. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=37.84s)]
*  His audience got so large that Tucker Carlson has been talked about as a presidential candidate, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  a successor to Donald Trump. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=47.32s)]
*  Then we saw his emails and his text messages disclosed in Fox's legal battle with Dominion [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=49.72s)]
*  voting systems. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=55.08s)]
*  Those messages made it plain that Carlson's cynicism is even larger than his ego or his [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=56.8s)]
*  ratings. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=62.28s)]
*  In private, he actually despised Donald Trump, hated him passionately, he said. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=63.56s)]
*  He expressed disdain for his bosses at Fox and talked about women in the most disgusting [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=69.14s)]
*  terms. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=75.0s)]
*  His behavior hurt Fox's case with Dominion and we assume that was a big factor in that [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=76.1s)]
*  enormous financial settlement. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=82.22s)]
*  Last week it caused Carlson his perch at 8pm on Fox and he was fired on Monday. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=84.94s)]
*  So what does this all mean for Fox News and for the brand of aggrieved right wing politics [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=91.53999999999999s)]
*  that Carlson most effectively championed? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=96.8s)]
*  I'm joined now by two colleagues who are staff writers here. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=100.13999999999999s)]
*  Andrew Morantz follows politics in the media very closely and Kellef Asane wrote about [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=103.1s)]
*  Tucker Carlson in The New Yorker. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=107.66s)]
*  About six years ago you profiled Tucker Carlson and I want to get a sense from you initially [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=110.94s)]
*  how he got to where he is today. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=118.14s)]
*  The father cocklin of the far right and a supporter of conspiracy theories and a great [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=121.89999999999999s)]
*  deal else. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=128.66s)]
*  So how did he travel this path? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=129.66s)]
*  Is it pure cynicism or did he actually change? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=131.78s)]
*  I mean it's amazing you're right he did start off as a magazine journalist. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=137.5s)]
*  He wrote what I think are some pretty great pieces for the weekly standard. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=142.34s)]
*  He wrote a piece for talk magazine an early profile of George W Bush a short-lived venture [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=147.62s)]
*  and from what I understand David you're here as the editor of the New Yorker magazine to [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=153.5s)]
*  make an announcement a hiring that's going to shock the media world is that correct? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=158.82s)]
*  Is Tucker returning to long-form journalism? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=163.38s)]
*  Yeah imagine the tragedy imagine the tragedy and the traffic. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=165.7s)]
*  So yes he has this career as a writer and then sort of semi accidentally semi on purpose [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=171.78s)]
*  becomes first a figure on TV and then a TV host. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=178.29999999999998s)]
*  He's a host on CNN doing crossfire and he has this famous confrontation with John Stewart [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=182.94s)]
*  who says you know you're hurting America. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=189.1s)]
*  He has a short-lived show on PBS he goes to MSNBC where he's working for a time with [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=192.66s)]
*  Rachel Maddow before she was well known and he starts working with Fox News. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=199.3s)]
*  At the time I profiled him his show was known for confrontation but as his show evolved [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=204.57999999999998s)]
*  it became less of a site for confrontation and it became more writerly really it became [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=209.86s)]
*  more known for what they call the A block where he would deliver this long monologue. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=216.38s)]
*  Funnily enough it was similar in structure sometimes to Rachel Maddow. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=221.34s)]
*  And doing that he was able to sort of start to shape this identity and this identity was [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=225.66s)]
*  a little more or a lot more populist right he was going to talk about immigration as [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=231.02s)]
*  a big threat to America and it was also kind of weird. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=236.29999999999998s)]
*  Tucker Carlson's show more than anything else on Fox News it felt like this moment it felt [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=240.38s)]
*  like the internet social media age where weird stuff was percolating through to the mainstream. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=245.89999999999998s)]
*  I think that's that's really the signature of the Trump era and he was able to express [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=252.01999999999998s)]
*  that on TV and unlike a lot of his colleagues at Fox News he made news he set the agenda [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=257.41999999999996s)]
*  people are wondering what is Tucker going to be saying tonight. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=264.62s)]
*  Okay now Andrew Morantz you've also written quite a lot about Tucker Carlson and a great [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=267.74s)]
*  deal about social media and its intersection with with television. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=273.5s)]
*  What danger did Tucker Carlson in your view pose to the Republic. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=279.26s)]
*  How do you respond to the notion that he was dangerous. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=284.62s)]
*  I think he was dangerous and so I think one has to hold in one's mind both you know he's [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=290.46s)]
*  a talented broadcaster and also he's a kind of rhetorical demagogue. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=295.5s)]
*  Which is exactly the description Dave Chappelle gave of Donald Trump. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=299.9s)]
*  One can both revel and laugh at that but you know I think it would be irresponsible to lose [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=303.5s)]
*  track of the fact that clearly Tucker was you know he was constantly you know dog whistling [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=308.94s)]
*  is almost too soft a term. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=316.78s)]
*  I mean he would say immigrants make our country poorer and dirtier. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=319.02s)]
*  He would say you know he one more recent thing is that he didn't refer to transgender people [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=323.18s)]
*  he referred to transgenderist people as if this isn't an identity this is a nefarious [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=328.78s)]
*  ideology that's you know Trojan horsing its way into our culture. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=333.5s)]
*  So I think that one of the things that a very talented demagogue like Tucker Carlson can [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=336.7s)]
*  do is put you on the back foot if you're critiquing him and Trump is good at this too in a different [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=341.64s)]
*  way of never quite coming out and saying the thing but coming as close as possible to saying it. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=347.48s)]
*  So that if you're then in the position of critiquing them you say you sound a bit [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=352.68s)]
*  unhinged right you sound hysterical. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=356.52s)]
*  He also and we're talking about him in the past tense even though I have every inclination to [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=358.12s)]
*  think that there's something ahead for Tucker Carlson I doubt very much I think we'd all agree [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=363.72s)]
*  that he's going to disappear somehow. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=368.76s)]
*  He also had a an incredible demagogic penchant for using the word you speaking very very directly [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=371.4s)]
*  you are being robbed you are being replaced you are being taken over they're robbing [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=381.88s)]
*  masculinity from the American culture you you you talk about that kind of rhetorical [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=387.15999999999997s)]
*  trick and why it appealed and to whom. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=395.24s)]
*  Well I think two older more conservative generally white men or white women who wanted [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=397.8s)]
*  to support the patriarchy I sound like a pearl clutch are making these critiques right. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=405.8s)]
*  But it I think we should say it plainly when he he would use phrases like legacy Americans. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=411.8s)]
*  Or you know we he he he would say that Ilhan Omar is being ungrateful because we saved her [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=419.0s)]
*  from a refugee camp and now she's criticizing our country. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=424.76s)]
*  Okay just grammatically like what do those things mean. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=428.36s)]
*  Well the hell with grammatically morally it's disgusting but I mean I am I am I overreacting [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=433.71999999999997s)]
*  here. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=440.12s)]
*  I I I think it is clear what he means and it's clearly disgusting and yet I don't think that it [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=440.52s)]
*  is entirely reducible to that which in a way makes it more dangerous because it's not like he just [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=448.03999999999996s)]
*  went on air every night and just said white men take to the battlements we must restore our [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=453.64s)]
*  country right. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=459.08s)]
*  That would be a boring show and I don't know if it would get him kicked off the air I would [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=459.47999999999996s)]
*  like to hope that it would but who knows anymore but he was more sly and subtle than that so it's [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=463.32s)]
*  not that everything he said was reducible to that but that was a ringing dog whistle underneath it [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=468.84s)]
*  all that he could have some shred of plausible deniability about but everyone knew what he meant [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=474.44s)]
*  and the white supremacists clearly knew what he meant. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=479.24s)]
*  Now Tucker Carlson in your view okay did he ever believe anything or is he purely an entertainer [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=481.24s)]
*  that's looking for the id of a of a big listenership and viewership. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=491.48s)]
*  You know I I sometimes wonder if he entirely knew I you know at the time at the dawn of the Trump [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=497.0s)]
*  era I sometimes thought that he thought of himself as a lawyer right in the sense that there was this [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=503.24s)]
*  big community of Trump voters and they didn't have representation on TV and he was going to [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=509.48s)]
*  represent them he was going to challenge channel them because they deserve because just like any [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=515.24s)]
*  defendant is entitled to a good lawyer maybe in his mind like any political coalition is entitled [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=519.96s)]
*  to a smart advocate on TV and he's going to advocate for those people. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=525.48s)]
*  Yeah I think and then I think over time you know most of us don't love living with that kind of [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=529.64s)]
*  cognitive dissonance and so most of us over time find ways to convince ourselves that the things [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=535.48s)]
*  that we're saying we really believe it and so I think it became more I think it became less of [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=542.36s)]
*  him. So your theory so he becomes the lawyer quote unquote for the great replacement theory [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=548.84s)]
*  and and a certain kind of white nationalism whatever you call it and then then he begins [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=553.8000000000001s)]
*  to embody it represent it symbolize it and he is it. Yeah and I think in the in the especially in [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=560.52s)]
*  the social media era there are these you know the way it works often is once you start saying [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=567.8s)]
*  something then all these people who disagree with you come at you and yell at you about it and it's [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=573.0799999999999s)]
*  really tempting to double down and say yeah those people who disagree are terrible I'm going to say [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=578.1999999999999s)]
*  more of this. Okay for the last year Andrew's been when he visits the office he comes in and the first [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=583.0s)]
*  thing he says is Tucker Carlson could be president of the United States he could run and he could [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=589.8s)]
*  possibly win. Andrew maybe elaborate a little bit on why you do come into my office and start [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=595.88s)]
*  talking about this possibility. Yeah look the chair is obviously hugely important that chair is is is [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=603.16s)]
*  the most powerful thing about him but he's clearly rhetorically skilled and and again to Kay's point [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=608.92s)]
*  he's clearly weird and in touch with future potential coalitions in a way that Bill O'Reilly [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=615.08s)]
*  is not and in a way that Megyn Kelly wasn't in a way that you know Laura Ingraham isn't I mean [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=621.5600000000001s)]
*  those people have the old school conservative DNA but they don't seem to be willing to cast around [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=626.6800000000001s)]
*  for the newer weirder thing in a way that Tucker did in a way that frankly Trump does too in a way [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=631.48s)]
*  that you could say why shouldn't we nuke a hurricane why shouldn't we buy Greenland why [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=636.5200000000001s)]
*  shouldn't we you know all these weird things that we get used to Trump doing Tucker was doing that [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=641.08s)]
*  night after night and so I think that's a big source of his power I think arguably Tucker has [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=645.0s)]
*  been going around giving campaign speech I mean he spoke in Iowa in last year shortly before the [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=649.88s)]
*  midterms at the family leadership summit that you don't just accidentally get on a plane to Iowa [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=655.16s)]
*  right he's clearly testing the waters and when he gives those speeches I think he's incredibly [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=659.4s)]
*  impressive again impressive in an amoral mercenary way I find it scary but I think it's very [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=663.72s)]
*  impressive he clearly has a touch that you know Rhonda Santus doesn't seem to have [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=669.32s)]
*  okay what do you think the future is for Tucker Carlson well I think you know one of the most one [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=674.6s)]
*  of the things I often think about is the Howard Stern model right and Howard Stern proved that [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=680.6s)]
*  you can go from broadcasting on the radio to narrow casting in Stern's case on satellite radio [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=685.48s)]
*  you can be successful you can maybe make more money and be less influential be a smaller figure [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=692.12s)]
*  and I think that that is often the most likely path for people that are very popular and very [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=698.44s)]
*  skilled and they're leaving a big platform there's a lot of opportunities for Tucker Carlson to go to [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=704.44s)]
*  a smaller platform and make a lot of money and be really successful be somewhat influential but it's [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=709.8800000000001s)]
*  still a little bit different from than being part of the Fox News being blasted into all these homes [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=716.2800000000001s)]
*  every night I think the other interesting question is what happens to Fox News on the day that it was [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=721.8000000000001s)]
*  announced that Tucker was fired there was precisely one person at Fox News who was willing [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=727.64s)]
*  to joke about it and that was Greg Gutfeld who's a co-host of The Five which is on some nights on [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=732.68s)]
*  some days their most popular show at 5 p.m. also has his own late night show at 11 p.m. which often [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=738.4399999999999s)]
*  beats the network late night shows in the ratings and you know there's an argument to be made that [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=744.28s)]
*  now Greg Gutfeld is one of the defining voices of Fox News and it's very different sensibility [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=749.72s)]
*  from Tucker's sensibility it's it's snarkier it's sillier and you know it would be interesting to [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=755.8s)]
*  see if Fox News is going more in the Gutfeld direction in the post Carlson era I just okay I [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=762.4399999999999s)]
*  have to say you and I can civilly disagree about whether is whether Tucker's a dangerous [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=767.9599999999999s)]
*  authoritarian or whatever but I will never go with you into thinking Greg Gutfeld is funny I'm sorry [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=772.76s)]
*  I can't go that far this is the real question we're going to be the limits that's where we set the [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=778.12s)]
*  limits here well well that leads me to this question yes he's fired he's gone other people [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=783.96s)]
*  have been fired is from Fox News but we're also in the midst of a media revolution that continues [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=792.2800000000001s)]
*  to evolve right cable television is declining the average age of the Fox News viewer is [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=797.32s)]
*  it's a it's 70 or around there clearly this constellation this world is changing we have [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=806.52s)]
*  on the New Yorker radio hour today another piece that Claire Malone is providing about Candace [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=814.8399999999999s)]
*  Owens and she suggests a new world a new generation younger than Tucker Carlson not white not male [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=821.0s)]
*  now the economics of this this universe are is changing but it all has to do with audience as [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=831.48s)]
*  well could Candace Owens a young black woman a conservative succeed on Fox at eight o'clock [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=837.16s)]
*  in the same way what do you think um I think Candace Owens would have trouble at this moment [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=846.6s)]
*  in Fox News because not because she's black but because she's kind of unpredictable um you know [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=855.16s)]
*  she's she's known you know partly for her broadcasting but also for her feuds I would [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=861.88s)]
*  guess that one thing that Fox News would want in that Tucker Carlson chair is someone who's a [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=867.4s)]
*  little more predictable a little more loyal a little less of a loose cannon so I would think [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=873.64s)]
*  that would be the issue for cancer for someone like Candace Owen Andrew well look I mean you [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=878.76s)]
*  know Tucker Carlson was doing almost explicitly a kind of white male identity politics on his show [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=884.28s)]
*  if that chair were to be filled by Candace Owens she would be doing a different kind of show but [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=892.6s)]
*  that's not to say that they wouldn't be able to make it work right these these movements [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=899.88s)]
*  these concepts these ideologies they can be pretty flexible right so it's not like when you had female [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=905.48s)]
*  anchors on Fox News you know the the patriarchy was over at Fox News or otherwise and if a person [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=911.72s)]
*  of color or a woman or both were to fill Tucker Carlson's chair they would do it in a different [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=920.44s)]
*  way but there would be a way to integrate that person's individual identity with the larger [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=924.52s)]
*  project you know the whole time we're having a conversation like this we're trying to you know [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=930.28s)]
*  guess what's in Tucker's mind or heart or whatever and and ultimately that's not what matters what [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=935.08s)]
*  matters is what he shows on the screen and and you know these words tend to lose meaning words [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=940.28s)]
*  like fascists tend to lose meaning because people throw them around at whoever they don't like [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=944.52s)]
*  but if you watch the end of men the Tucker Carlson originals series about how sperm counts in the west [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=948.68s)]
*  in air quotes are declining and what we need to do is get birth rates up so that well-ordered [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=957.56s)]
*  regiments of men can take back order and control and the visual montages on the screen I say in the [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=962.1999999999999s)]
*  piece look like an Abercrombie ad directed by Lenny Riefenstahl I mean the aesthetics of it [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=968.84s)]
*  are fascist I don't think he's got militias that he's controls I mean I don't I'm I haven't lost [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=973.24s)]
*  you know the scale of this here but if the most powerful seat in conservative media is controlled [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=978.68s)]
*  by someone who is willing to put out aesthetics into the world that strike me as fascist aesthetics [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=985.4s)]
*  with a capital F like the clinical academic definition that's not a good thing I don't think [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=992.6s)]
*  we need to jump to the conclusion that the country is doomed immediately but it can't be good but [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=998.52s)]
*  again part of part of what was so significant about this is that it was happening in the mainstream [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1002.52s)]
*  right like this is this is one of the this is one of the defining qualities of politics over the [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1007.48s)]
*  last 10 years is that all this stuff that you think would be sort of fringy right on the right [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1012.76s)]
*  and I will say on the left shows up in the mainstream and so you have someone like Tucker [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1018.84s)]
*  Carlson you watch his show you know especially as the major advertisers kind of fled it's you know [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1024.04s)]
*  he's he's doing these kind of slightly weird monologues then you've got a bunch of ads for [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1029.56s)]
*  Mike Lindell my pillow and then you're back on the show it doesn't feel like you're watching [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1034.52s)]
*  like normal mainstream American tv it feels like you've stumbled down a rabbit hole [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1038.68s)]
*  Andrew Morantz, Kelefa-Sane thank you so much thank you thank you [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1044.92s)]
*  Andrew Morantz and Kelefa-Sane are both staff writers at the New Yorker. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1049.08s)]
*  This is the New Yorker Radio Hour. More to come. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1054.28s)]
*  This is the New Yorker Radio Hour. I'm David Remnick. Earlier in the show we talked about [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1069.8799999999999s)]
*  Earlier in the show we talked about Tucker Carlson's ouster from Fox. The dominion lawsuit laid bare [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1075.48s)]
*  just how afraid Fox News was of the competition. Afraid of driving its viewers away with news they [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1081.3999999999999s)]
*  did not want to hear. Fox was for a long time the only big conservative news outlet out there but [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1088.1999999999998s)]
*  there's now a whole universe of right-wing and far-right media. One of the major players here [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1095.48s)]
*  is the Daily Wire. Along with news it produces documentaries, tv shows and especially podcasts. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1102.4399999999998s)]
*  Podcasts that feature such voices as Ben Shapiro who talks a lot about woke college campuses [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1109.3999999999999s)]
*  and the men's movement guru Jordan Peterson. And in this largely white male group Candace [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1115.7199999999998s)]
*  Owens stands out. Owens got her start on YouTube early in the Trump era with a coming out spoof [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1122.1999999999998s)]
*  that went viral. Mom, dad, I'm a lesbian. I like girls. Oh sweetheart. We always knew. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1128.52s)]
*  The bottom line we just want our children to be happy and we love you regardless. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1140.28s)]
*  Brave soul. Oh thank you guys. Oh also I think I might be a conservative. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1144.36s)]
*  I don't understand. She then emerged as a fierce supporter of President Trump. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1151.6399999999999s)]
*  One more question because I'm sure you've gotten this question tons of times but [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1156.6799999999998s)]
*  are you going to run in 2024 and if so can I be your vice president? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1160.36s)]
*  Oh that's very interesting. Wow what a good choice that would be. That would be fantastic. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1164.84s)]
*  Trump Owens 24. So yeah I think that's a great that would be huge. You would be fantastic and [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1168.84s)]
*  you know I really appreciate the job you do and everybody does. Owens commands an online following [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1175.24s)]
*  in the millions and she's leading a movement to bring right-wing politics to a younger and more [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1180.76s)]
*  female audience. Our media reporter Claire Malone went to see Candace Owens recently [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1186.04s)]
*  at the offices of the Daily Wire in Nashville. Now Claire I just had a long talk about Tucker [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1191.24s)]
*  Carlson with our colleagues Kela Fasani and Andrew Moran. We talked about whether someone [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1196.84s)]
*  like Candace Owens could succeed in his time slot on Fox News. What do you think? [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1201.56s)]
*  I think that's a really interesting question and I think purely on the mechanics of that job and by [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1207.8s)]
*  that I mean speaking directly to a camera, monologuing, not having other people you need [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1213.56s)]
*  to bounce off of. Candace can do that. She can do it in the same way that Tucker Carlson or Rush [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1218.2s)]
*  Limbaugh or any other you know conservative talk radio person can do it. So I think she could [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1223.24s)]
*  actually do the job. There are two other factors that I think maybe would prevent her from actually [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1228.2s)]
*  doing that. One is I would say the sexism of cable television right. I think people at Fox, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1234.04s)]
*  people who run Fox probably think that they need an anchorman in that 8 p.m. slot. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1241.96s)]
*  I get a lot of notes whenever I'm on a podcast about the way I speak or my cadence and I'm sure [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1247.24s)]
*  Candace would also get those. Lots of women get that feedback so it's easier to pillory a woman [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1253.6399999999999s)]
*  in that way and I think that would probably hold Fox execs back from giving a woman the 8 p.m. slot, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1258.6s)]
*  personal opinion. Then the second factor I think is I don't know if Candace would want to do [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1264.28s)]
*  something like that even though the 8 p.m. slot on Fox News is a huge prestige spot in conservative [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1269.0s)]
*  media. She likes that she's speaking to a younger and specific audience on the daily wire. She gets [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1274.76s)]
*  to do her own thing and I think she's got pretty free range so I'm not sure if she would actually [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1280.92s)]
*  accept a position at Fox News. So Clare, very often in a story like this there's a rosebud moment, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1286.52s)]
*  a pivot moment in somebody's life that turns them from one thing to another. Here's a woman [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1295.08s)]
*  that began her, at least in her youth, she was a pretty standard issue, liberal, African American, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1300.84s)]
*  left leaning. Was there a moment where she changed radically or where she sees that she changed [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1307.72s)]
*  radically? There's a really pivotal moment in Candace's life when she's a 17 year old senior [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1313.96s)]
*  in high school in Stamford, Connecticut and she was friends with this boy at school. They had a [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1319.56s)]
*  falling out, he was suspended from school, he gets angry at her, calls her and leaves her very [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1324.92s)]
*  nasty, racist, threatening voicemails while he's in the car with three other boys. Now as it turns [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1330.2s)]
*  out one of those boys is the 14 year old son of then Stamford Mayor, Danil Malloy, who would later [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1336.76s)]
*  become the governor of Connecticut. And basically what happens is this turns into a good old-fashioned [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1343.48s)]
*  political scandal and unfortunately for Candace she is the 17 year old at the center of it. She [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1348.44s)]
*  was out of school for six weeks, when she comes back she's surrounded by her family members and [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1354.68s)]
*  the NAACP. There's a lot of local discourse about whether or not she's just faking all this for [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1360.52s)]
*  attention. And I think what Candace took away from that experience was she didn't like being a victim, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1365.5600000000002s)]
*  she didn't like feeling powerless. And I think there was a lot of personal fallout for her from [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1372.2s)]
*  that moment. She talks about it as sort of a moment where she lost control, she developed an [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1377.8s)]
*  eating disorder, she says as a reaction to that, she wanted to regain control. And I think even in [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1384.04s)]
*  her life, you know, she's a 30-something year old woman now, a huge narrative in, you know, when she [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1389.56s)]
*  speaks to her social media followers or she speaks on her podcasts, she talks about shedding a victim [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1395.1599999999999s)]
*  mentality. That is kind of your persona, right? Like tough, tough girl. Tough life, you know? And I think [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1400.36s)]
*  that it sets me apart, it shouldn't. I don't like, you heard me speak to this today, I think it's really [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1408.6s)]
*  weird that we live in this society where everyone's hand is being held at all times and they're being [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1414.52s)]
*  told they're amazing, they're great, and they're obviously not amazing, they're obviously not great. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1418.04s)]
*  They could be, they could be better than they were yesterday. We all have bad days, I certainly have [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1421.0s)]
*  them. And so, you know, life's tough, get a helmet, I guess, is kind of my perspective. If we all sat [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1426.04s)]
*  around and kumbaya'd and held hands like Drew Barrymore and Dylan Mulvaney, we'd never get off the floor. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1435.16s)]
*  Okay, and to explain that last little jab, Drew Barrymore now has a talk show, the Drew Barrymore [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1441.3200000000002s)]
*  show, and on it, Drew Barrymore had this sort of admittedly kind of awkward TV moment where she [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1446.8400000000001s)]
*  kneeled in front of this sort of infamous in conservative circles trans influencer named [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1453.8000000000002s)]
*  Dylan Mulvaney. And that's a kind of pop culture moment that Candace really latches onto because [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1459.32s)]
*  her thing now is talking about pop culture, being very fluent in it, but also telling her listeners, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1465.8s)]
*  here's what's perverse about it. And Candace is very, very anti-trans. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1472.6799999999998s)]
*  How does she differ if she differs at all other than the age of her audience from Sean Hannity, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1477.3999999999999s)]
*  Tucker Carlson, and that group? Well, I think perhaps first and foremost, though she came [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1483.32s)]
*  into our consciousness as this gung-ho Trump supporter and sort of focusing on electoral [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1490.6s)]
*  politics, we were all glued to the Trump administration and what was going on, I think [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1497.08s)]
*  she's made this interesting shift, and she chalks it up to becoming a mother, she now has two kids, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1500.84s)]
*  where she's focusing a lot more on culture issues. So pop culture, even things like, you know, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1506.44s)]
*  vaccines, she does not believe in any kind of vaccination, you know, the cleanliness of [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1516.1200000000001s)]
*  household products. There's a little bit of a, you know, a conspiratorial mindset at work, right? [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1521.8s)]
*  Be suspicious of everything that's presented to you by mainstream culture. But Candace is [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1528.2s)]
*  really focusing on pop culture as something that conservatives have ignored and something [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1532.52s)]
*  that it's important for them not to ignore. And Candace and I talked a lot about her audience and [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1538.04s)]
*  what maybe makes it different from other Daily Wire hosts. So if you think about someone like [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1542.84s)]
*  Ben Shapiro, he has a pretty male audience. And she told me that Jeremy Boring, who's the Daily [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1546.36s)]
*  Wire CEO, he told her that her audience is actually special and different from other Daily Wire hosts. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1551.08s)]
*  Teenagers to nine year olds consume my content, which is super interesting. I think that one [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1557.96s)]
*  thing that we've realized is a lot of moms follow me. I have a very strong mother demographic. And [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1564.76s)]
*  I think that's because a lot of stuff I speak about that I'm passionate about is children. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1572.68s)]
*  So that makes sense. I mean, yoga pants, who's going to watch that and be like, ah, yeah, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1575.64s)]
*  it's going to be moms. So which I have fun with. I am very proud of the work that I do, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1578.92s)]
*  especially because a lot of it speaks to moms on the left and the right. So that was kind of [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1584.44s)]
*  a very exciting time for me. All right. So she's against yoga pants. First of all, I'd like to know [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1588.76s)]
*  what that signifies. But when she talks about a mom demographic, what other topics is she talking [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1595.3999999999999s)]
*  about and why? Yeah. And just to quickly explain the yoga pants, Candace has a sort of half joking, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1601.8799999999999s)]
*  half serious thing that American women look too sloppy. They need to try harder. They need to [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1607.8799999999999s)]
*  beautify themselves. And actually, that's silly. And she knows it's a little silly, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1614.04s)]
*  but it's connected to this bigger thing and this of what she's talking to our audience about, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1618.6s)]
*  which is basically traditionalism. She thinks that women should be women and men should be men. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1623.8s)]
*  And Candace sort of acts that out via social media, via a podcast. This is what a woman should be. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1631.3999999999999s)]
*  She should cook dinner for her husband. She should garden. She should beautify herself. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1636.36s)]
*  And she should care about her children's school. What's happening? What pronouns are they trying [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1639.96s)]
*  to get your children to use at school, is an example that Candace brought up to me. So I think [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1647.16s)]
*  Candace is, she's actually talking about issues that a lot of Americans think about. Now, is the [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1651.64s)]
*  way that Candace approaches this smart? I don't know. She is really harsh language. She has really [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1657.64s)]
*  a lot of retrograde ideas. Someone said to me, I think of Candace Owens as sort of like [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1665.48s)]
*  the Phyllis Schlafly of the Instagram age, because she's pushing sort of traditional [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1670.92s)]
*  feminine roles. I love my femininity. I celebrate femininity. I tell women this weird culture of [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1677.96s)]
*  telling women to de-beautify themselves and to be more masculine. I mean, it's just bad. It's just [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1685.16s)]
*  bad. I believe that femininity is an absolute gift. It should be treated as such. I am the [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1692.12s)]
*  opposite of Lena Dunham, I think would be fair to say. Whatever she brought in, I am the opposite [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1700.6s)]
*  of that. The girls are like, I haven't changed my armpits and this is encouraging. I'm overweight [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1705.9599999999998s)]
*  and now you need to, if you don't like it, there's something wrong with you. Which I challenge you [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1711.8799999999999s)]
*  the other way. It's like, you don't need to be a size zero. There's opposite extremes and they're [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1717.32s)]
*  not healthy. But to take care of yourself, when did we start looking down on taking care of yourself? [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1721.0s)]
*  Phyllis Schlafly, who for those who don't remember, was a kind of anti-feminist activist [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1729.24s)]
*  who organized against the Equal Rights Amendment in the 70s. And then you have Lena Dunham, [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1734.12s)]
*  who of course was the originator and star of the show Girls, which projected, I would say, [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1739.16s)]
*  I think it's fair to say, a very different view of the world than Phyllis Schlafly. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1746.12s)]
*  She thinks this is a winner. Is she wrong? [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1751.72s)]
*  Candice again picks out these moments in pop culture where, yeah, maybe an audience does [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1757.8s)]
*  have a reaction to not shaving your armpits or trans activists being on TV and talking about [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1766.92s)]
*  their experience. Maybe people are uncomfortable with those things that go outside, you know, [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1773.64s)]
*  to traditional, to use the freshman year gender studies class term, the performance of gender. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1779.48s)]
*  But again, she does it in this really harsh cutting way. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1788.0400000000002s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1792.76s)]
*  Yeah, I talked a lot about that with her. I said, you know, even if you believe that you are on the [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1794.0400000000002s)]
*  right side of history on all those issues, isn't there something she said for persuasion? You catch [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1800.2s)]
*  more flies with honey than you do with vinegar. But I would also say that, you know, she, the way [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1805.96s)]
*  she tells it, she's also trying to pierce this liberal Hollywood thought bubble. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1810.2s)]
*  The problem when there is just an applause and you think it's great and it's a Hollywood applause and [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1816.28s)]
*  you see your favorite actors, like if I was a kid and saw Denzel Washington applauding something, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1822.2s)]
*  I'm like, oh my gosh, well, I think he's so cool. Then it must be cool. You have to answer that. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1826.68s)]
*  You have to say it's not cool. Actually, let me actually make you understand what this really [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1831.72s)]
*  entails. Because if you go down this route and you decide to take puberty blockers, again, [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1837.0s)]
*  using the example of Doreen Mulvaney, because we're talking about trans issues, here's what can happen [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1841.56s)]
*  to your body. And here is why I bring you Waltz higher. Here's why I bring these other people that [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1845.4s)]
*  went through this route. Here's why I bring people that are suing their doctors. You talk to culture [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1849.8s)]
*  because it needs a response. And just so people know, Waltz higher, who Candice is referring to [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1854.6s)]
*  there, is someone who lived for a few years as a transgender woman and then de-transitioned. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1860.6799999999998s)]
*  So you can't fight culture by refusing to talk about it. It doesn't even make sense. And this [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1867.6399999999999s)]
*  has been, in my opinion, a huge reason that conservatives ceded so much ground to the left [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1872.52s)]
*  because we stuck up our nose to culture. I don't stick up my nose to culture. I consume culture [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1879.0s)]
*  and it is very important for me to contextualize culture so that for all the young teenagers that [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1884.2s)]
*  are following me, rather than just seeing Dillon Mulvaney pretending to be a woman and receiving [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1888.68s)]
*  awards and being applauded by Hollywood and sitting down with Jibiru Moore and thinking, [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1894.04s)]
*  wow, that's really cool. They now have somebody talking about this and saying, actually, this [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1896.76s)]
*  isn't cool. So now they can start thinking critically, which makes more sense to me. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1900.44s)]
*  So she made some pretty explosive comments about gender during your interview and she does that [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1904.8400000000001s)]
*  routinely. She's also extremely provocative on race, like last fall when she and Kanye West, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1910.3600000000001s)]
*  who she's close to, showed up to Paris Fashion Week in matching shirts that said, [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1916.5200000000002s)]
*  white lives matter. What kind of argument were those two trying to make? [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1922.0400000000002s)]
*  This is the argument that has kind of been Candace's bread and butter since she broke out. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1927.5600000000002s)]
*  She talks about how black Americans, in her phrasology, need to leave the plantation of the [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1934.2800000000002s)]
*  Democratic Party and she's purposely provocative in that language. She's been extremely critical [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1938.84s)]
*  of the Black Lives Matter movement and about George Floyd in particular. Here's what she said on her [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1944.4399999999998s)]
*  show the day that the verdict was delivered for Derek Chauvin. I have to appreciate people that [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1949.56s)]
*  were trying to create a pressure campaign for me on Twitter saying, I wonder what Candace is going [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1955.32s)]
*  to say. Even Republicans agreed that this was the right call. I don't care who agrees that this was [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1959.1599999999999s)]
*  the right. I don't care if it's a Republican. I don't care if it's a Democrat. I don't care if [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1965.24s)]
*  it's a white person. I don't care if it's a black person. I am not so much of an intellectual coward [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1968.12s)]
*  that because the mob decides something, because the lie about George Floyd and the way that he [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1974.4399999999998s)]
*  lived his life has become so big that we just have to now accept it as the truth. And believe me, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1979.8799999999999s)]
*  this is a lie. So the lie she's referring to is what she sees as the media whitewashing of Floyd's [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1986.28s)]
*  personal shortcomings. She made a documentary that focused heavily on his history of addiction [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1992.92s)]
*  and Candace continues to say that Floyd died from an overdose, though that was determined not to be [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=1998.52s)]
*  the primary cause of his death. This is a hard question, but how sincere is she about what she [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2003.88s)]
*  says about George Floyd? Yes, we know George Floyd's life was complicated. Nobody is disputing that. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2009.48s)]
*  But isn't this just a naked grab for audience attention and everything that goes with it? [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2016.52s)]
*  You're right. It is a hard question. And I talked to Leah Wright-Raghor, who's a scholar who wrote a [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2022.92s)]
*  book called The Loneliness of the Black Republican. And she's someone who thinks a lot about Candace. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2028.68s)]
*  And Leah puts Candace in this category of racial provocateur of which there is a long history in [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2033.16s)]
*  the US. But I think what's different about Candace is the technology that she's operating with. Do I [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2038.52s)]
*  think she believes those very personal critiques of George Floyd? Yes, I do. I think that she's got [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2045.88s)]
*  a very contrarian, conspiratorial worldview. And she immediately reacted to what she saw [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2051.24s)]
*  was an undue hagiography of a flawed person. I also think she can be quite harsh in her judgments [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2057.16s)]
*  of people. I also think she knows very cynically what subjects will go viral. And so being a [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2062.3599999999997s)]
*  provocateur talking about George Floyd in this really mean way, she knows will go viral. And this [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2070.04s)]
*  digital age means that Candace's platform technology helps amplify what is a small group [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2081.8799999999997s)]
*  of right-wing black Americans saying really outre things. In some ways, giving cover for [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2088.2s)]
*  white Americans who think that the George Floyd story is a conspiracy to say, [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2095.0s)]
*  oh, well, look, a black person said it. I'm not being racist if I say this thing. So Candace is [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2100.2s)]
*  providing cover. Finally, let's look at 2024. And I want to listen carefully to this exchange [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2105.16s)]
*  that you had with Candace Owens about what she thinks might be the crucial culture war issues [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2113.72s)]
*  in the presidential race coming up. I mean, it really mattered when moms started showing up [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2120.68s)]
*  at the school boards and realizing what was in the books. I think moms are starting to pay more [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2125.3999999999996s)]
*  attention to what's happening. It's not necessarily just transgenderism. It's everything that's [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2129.96s)]
*  happening in the classroom. Suddenly, it feels like we're in a custody dispute with the state [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2134.52s)]
*  for our children. And I think that moms are responding to that. So I do think that me speaking [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2138.2s)]
*  to mothers, I hope it will have real-world implications in the election because it's [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2145.64s)]
*  usually moms that are opening up the mail, speaking with their husbands about who to vote for. I hope [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2150.28s)]
*  that I encourage mothers to be more tuned into that sort of a thing. I think that some of the [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2157.0s)]
*  toxicities surrounding feminism and why I shirk away from it is that it encouraged mothers to just [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2161.72s)]
*  trust the state to raise their kids. And you go get a job and be like dad and be like men, and this [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2168.9199999999996s)]
*  will put you on equal footing. Do you have a job though? I have no issue with women having jobs [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2173.24s)]
*  at all. Obviously, I have a job. I'm just saying that there was this pressure that basically said [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2176.7599999999998s)]
*  to women that if you stay at home and you are instead spending all your time doing this, then [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2182.68s)]
*  it's because you're serving the patriarchy. And I had that brainwashing taking place at my university [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2187.48s)]
*  when I was forced to take a women's studies class. And basically, that was the whole point. Men are [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2193.16s)]
*  awful. Men are terrible. And the one way that you can beat men is to compete with them at every level. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2197.8s)]
*  I don't feel that way anymore. I don't feel like I want to compete with men. And I, again, give women [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2203.96s)]
*  permission to aspire to be a stay-at-home mom. All right. Let's leave aside the assertion that she was [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2209.0s)]
*  forced to take a women's studies class. That bears checking. But she is using the word over and over [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2214.84s)]
*  again. It's like a mantra of moms, moms, I'm speaking to you. Do you think in the upcoming race [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2222.28s)]
*  that that could really help? You've got all these male cultural warriors on the right. You've got [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2230.84s)]
*  DeSantis himself who's making culture more and more and more at the center of his campaign. And [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2235.8s)]
*  Trump, of course. Do you think this works for the Republicans? I do think it works to appeal to [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2243.08s)]
*  women. I mean, Mitch McConnell, the night of the 2020 election, I believe, said, we lost too many [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2251.16s)]
*  women. I mean, I think this is something that the Republicans know. And I do think that there's [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2258.84s)]
*  something to be said for moms, for suburban women turning out in elections. We saw in 2016 and two [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2263.7999999999997s)]
*  years ago in Virginia when suburban women swung to the right and voted in a governor who campaigned [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2269.56s)]
*  on COVID era school closures and education policy. People vote based on real worry about their kids. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2275.32s)]
*  You can't find any issue more personal than that. And I think Candace is poised to have an influence [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2282.2s)]
*  on this group that her peers at the Daily Wire aren't. She's a mom. She's speaking directly to [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2287.32s)]
*  other moms, which is something that her male counterparts like Ben Shapiro can't replicate. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2292.52s)]
*  That said, she has a really harsh tone and a conspiratorial mindset [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2297.4s)]
*  that I'm not sure would appeal to women in the middle. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjkPU3aWuQI&t=2302.04s)]
