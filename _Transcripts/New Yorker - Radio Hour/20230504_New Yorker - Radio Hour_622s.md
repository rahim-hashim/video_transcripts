Video Description: On May 6th, King Charles will become the oldest person to ascend the throne of the United Kingdom. He is a bit of an odd duck to be the king, Rebecca Mead (https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/rebecca-mead) thinks. Charles has “long made clear that he considers his birthright a burden,” she writes. In fact, many things are a burden: during the ceremonies following the death of Queen Elizabeth, the new king “got into not one but two altercations with malfunctioning pens. . . . As his biographer Catherine Mayer puts it, ‘The world is against him—even inanimate objects are against him. That is absolutely central to his personality.’ ” Mead—a subject of the king, as well as a staff writer—talks with David Remnick about Charles III’s coronation, the problem of Harry and Meghan, and the future of the British monarchy itself.

# King Charles III Takes the Throne
**New Yorker Radio Hour:** [May 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U)
*  This is the New Yorker Radio Hour, a co-production of WNYC Studios and The New Yorker. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=0.0s)]
*  This is the New Yorker Radio Hour. This is Rebecca Mead. And this is London. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=11.24s)]
*  After Queen Elizabeth II died at the age of 96, King Charles III delivered a televised [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  speech, his first public address as monarch. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=23.92s)]
*  I speak to you today with feelings of profound sorrow. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=27.0s)]
*  His eyes were roomy and his complexion florid. His hair, thoroughly silver, was brushed as [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=31.96s)]
*  carefully as it had been in 1953 when, as a fidgety four-year-old, he had endured his [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  mother's almost three-hour-long coronation service in Westminster Abbey. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=43.6s)]
*  Queen Elizabeth was a life well lived, a promise with destiny kept. That promise of lifelong [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  service I renew to you all today. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=56.98s)]
*  Rebecca has coronation mania begun on the streets of London? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=63.019999999999996s)]
*  I don't really think it has. I mean, not as far as I've seen that. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=67.58s)]
*  That is deeply disappointing. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=71.22s)]
*  I've been invited to one party. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=74.1s)]
*  Okay, let's just start. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=76.06s)]
*  I can't tell quite whether it's a serious party or a joke party. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=78.1s)]
*  Charles has long made it clear that he considers his birthright a burden. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=87.98s)]
*  Nobody knows what utter hell it is to be the Prince of Wales, he has reportedly complained. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=93.02000000000001s)]
*  Although he is literally the most entitled man in the land, a royal can feel like an [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=98.34s)]
*  anachronism and he apparently feels a kinship with certain other Britons who are marginalised. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=102.9s)]
*  Paddy Harvison, the Prince's former communications secretary, says that Charles has a particular [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=109.10000000000001s)]
*  fondness for the sheep farmers of remote Cumbria because they are about the most forgotten [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=114.14s)]
*  community you can find. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=119.02s)]
*  Tom Parker-Bowles, Charles' godson and later his stepson, grew up thinking that Charles' [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=122.46000000000001s)]
*  name was Sir because that's all anyone ever called him. Yet Sir suffers from a peculiar [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=127.66s)]
*  aristocratic version of imposter syndrome. He is wise enough to know that in almost any [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=133.96s)]
*  room he enters, other than one occupied by members of his family, he is likely to be [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=139.5s)]
*  the only person present whose power and influence derive entirely from his birth. Indeed, if [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=144.46s)]
*  Charles checked his privilege, there would be nothing left of him, just a crumpled pile [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=150.9s)]
*  of ermine and velvet and a faint whiff of au sauvage. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=155.74s)]
*  Elizabeth became Queen when she was so young. Before really she had a chance to have a public [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=161.54s)]
*  profile or opinions of any kind. Charles has a long record, so it's hard for him to conceal [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=166.34s)]
*  himself. Are people bored with him? Are they eager to see him King? What's the level of [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=172.5s)]
*  the degree to which people even care about what's about to happen? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=180.3s)]
*  It's really funny. I mean, he's a person who has not been popular on and off in the whole [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=185.02s)]
*  marriage with Diana and the divorce and all of that didn't do his ratings very much good. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=190.66s)]
*  And there have been opinion polls asking whether people thought he would be a good King or [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=197.85999999999999s)]
*  not and there was kind of lukewarm and maybe not so great. The minute the Queen died or [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=201.78s)]
*  you know, the week that the Queen died, polls were taken again. How good a King will Charles [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=208.38s)]
*  be? And his favourables doubled, which goes to show, I think, that the position brings [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=214.51999999999998s)]
*  with it a kind of gravitas and respect that many Britons just accept and defer to. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=222.48s)]
*  Let's ask it a perennial American question and maybe to some degree it's a British question, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=229.16s)]
*  why still have a King in 2023? Many countries either have gotten rid of the monarchy entirely [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=232.72s)]
*  or have reduced it to such a point. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=240.64s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I think maybe part of it is that, you know, Britain did try to get rid of the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=243.92s)]
*  monarchy at one point in the 17th century and indeed did get rid of the monarchy. And [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=251.07999999999998s)]
*  there were 11 years of Republican rule until the Houses of Parliament decided that they [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=256.52s)]
*  would rather have the monarchy back and Charles II came in and it's all been relatively stable [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=261.52s)]
*  since then. So, you know, we've been through that. We did try it and it didn't stick, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=266.32s)]
*  let's say. People often say, well, yeah, but look what happens when you have a president [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=272.04s)]
*  in the United States, for example, you can get a Donald Trump at the head of the country. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=277.88s)]
*  Isn't it better to have somebody who is above politics, separated from politics? Of course, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=282.8s)]
*  the answer to that is yeah. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=288.84s)]
*  But that doesn't prevent you from having a buffoon. You had Boris Johnson, who's nobody's [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=289.84s)]
*  idea of dignity personified. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=294.88s)]
*  That is true, but he wasn't the head of state. So this is an, I'm giving you the pro-monarchy [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=297.92s)]
*  argument here is that you can have a head of state who's not an elected buffoon. Of [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=303.04s)]
*  course, you could also have a head of state who's a hereditary buffoon, which we could [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=310.32s)]
*  have had easily here if Charles had fallen off his polo pony at the age of 29 and we'd [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=314.2s)]
*  now be facing King Andrew I. God save us all. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=321.20000000000005s)]
*  Charles is more popular than he once was, in part because he was once so very unpopular. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=330.84000000000003s)]
*  All the same, wearing the crown will not alter his fundamental character. When, in the days [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=336.12s)]
*  after the Queen's death, he took part in ceremonies establishing his kingship, he got [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=341.36s)]
*  into not one but two altercations with malfunctioning pens. And his irascible response the second [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=345.6s)]
*  time, I can't bear this bloody thing, what they do every stinking time, was recognisable [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=352.20000000000005s)]
*  to anyone who has spent time observing him. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=357.0s)]
*  As his biographer Catherine Mayer puts it, the world is against him. Even inanimate objects [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=367.16s)]
*  are against him. That is absolutely central to his personality. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=371.96s)]
*  Rebecca Mead reading from her essay on the new King Charles, back in a moment. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=379.88s)]
*  Now you can't have a conversation about the Royals without talking about, of course, Harry [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=393.67999999999995s)]
*  and Meghan. What's been the net effect of their estrangement, their Oprah interview, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=398.28000000000003s)]
*  the book, all of it on this whole proceeding and on the Royal family? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=403.24s)]
*  They do not look good from this side of the ocean. I mean, there has to be an ongoing [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=408.84000000000003s)]
*  narrative and right now the ongoing narrative is they turn their backs and they're off in [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=415.44s)]
*  California making loads of money and that's not very dignified or cool. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=420.88s)]
*  So Harry, because as you know, because I send you clips from it all the time, I read [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=427.32s)]
*  the Daily Mail constantly, Harry will be at the coronation, Meghan will not be at the [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=431.56s)]
*  coronation, Harry will be sat many rows behind the family. What do you make of all this? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=436.68s)]
*  I think it was a stroke of genius on the part of somebody in Buckingham Palace to arrange [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=445.52s)]
*  for the coronation to be on the same day as Harry and Meghan's oldest child's birthday [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=452.92s)]
*  because that gives them the perfect out. I mean, Meghan can stay home, she can stay with [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=460.12s)]
*  Archie, celebrate him turning four or whatever it is that he's turning and Harry can come [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=466.40000000000003s)]
*  but he doesn't have to stay. I just think there's some genius event planning going on [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=472.40000000000003s)]
*  there. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=480.84000000000003s)]
*  If I read your piece correctly, and you can correct me if you want, you seem somewhat [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=482.14s)]
*  sympathetic toward Charles. You think he's gotten a bad rap? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=487.21999999999997s)]
*  I think Charles is probably a very decent man. I think that he's a bit of a weirdo and [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=491.46s)]
*  I say that with the... [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=500.62s)]
*  Loving respect. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=502.21999999999997s)]
*  I do say it with loving respect. I mean, I think it's a good thing. He wrote this book [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=503.21999999999997s)]
*  that brings together all of his interests and passions and shows the ways in which they're [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=508.41999999999996s)]
*  all connected in this kind of sacred architecture, the golden mean, all that kind of stuff. It's [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=512.78s)]
*  kind of great. It's a little bit loopy and it's also sort of fantastic that he wrote [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=523.18s)]
*  it and produced this sort of manifesto. I don't think enough people have read it. I [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=529.64s)]
*  am sympathetic towards him. I think my position on the monarchy, broadly speaking, is that [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=534.54s)]
*  the strongest argument for its abolition is that it is a violation of the human rights [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=540.86s)]
*  of the individuals in the royal family to have to endure what they do have to endure. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=546.3s)]
*  And I think to the extent that we should get rid of the monarchy, abolish the monarchy, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=552.62s)]
*  it really should be for their sake, at least as much as for us. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=556.0999999999999s)]
*  So your slogan would be, free the king. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=559.3s)]
*  Totally. Free the lot of them. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=562.22s)]
*  Rebecca Mead, our royals correspondent, and much else. Thank you so much. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhttR7kyT2U&t=570.6999999999999s)]
