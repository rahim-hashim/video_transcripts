# How to protect yourself from financial SCAMS
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g)
*  Democratic Senator Maggie Hassan is sounding the alarm on the growing threats of financial [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=0.0s)]
*  scams as part of her work as the ranking member on the Joint Economic Committee. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=4.78s)]
*  The New Hampshire senator says digital scam losses have increased 370 percent in the U.S. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=10.64s)]
*  over the past five years. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=18.88s)]
*  What's more, scam victims lost one trillion dollars globally last year alone. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=20.6s)]
*  The senator joins us right now. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=27.74s)]
*  She just launched a survey on her senate website this morning to collect information on common [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=30.06s)]
*  scams and to aid efforts to combat them. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=35.739999999999995s)]
*  It's very good to have you on the show, Senator. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=39.7s)]
*  So tell us about what these scams, some of them that are out there, look like now. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=42.06s)]
*  Well, thanks for having me on. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=47.06s)]
*  Yeah, as you point out, we have seen an explosion of these scams. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=49.14s)]
*  I think most of your viewers have been on the receiving end of a text or a phone call [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=53.3s)]
*  or an email that says something like you have an unpaid toll or a loved one is in danger. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=57.42s)]
*  Hurry up, pay some money right now. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=63.260000000000005s)]
*  And it's cost the global economy a trillion dollars in the last year. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=66.5s)]
*  That eclipses even the global illicit drug trade. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=72.22s)]
*  So as the ranking member of the Joint Economic Committee, we really look at economic trends, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=76.06s)]
*  things that affect businesses, consumers. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=81.26s)]
*  We know that victims of these frauds sometimes lose their life savings, their retirements [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=84.3s)]
*  accounts. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=89.38s)]
*  So we're really trying to launch this investigation to get a handle on what's happening. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=90.38s)]
*  The advent of AI is responsible for some of this because it allows criminals to scale [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=96.46s)]
*  up these scams and to individualize them. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=101.5s)]
*  But we also know that part of the problem is the piecemeal law enforcement response, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=105.72s)]
*  local law enforcement, state, federal. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=111.14s)]
*  And one of the things the Joint Economic Committee can do is really find out more about how these [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=113.92s)]
*  scams are happening, but also reach out across the private sector to find out what tools [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=118.8s)]
*  are being used, what platforms are being manipulated, what businesses are already doing to try to [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=123.24000000000001s)]
*  combat these scams and really take all kind of comprehensive approach here so we can begin [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=128.22s)]
*  to shut these scams down. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=135.2s)]
*  Senator, to your point, the scams keep evolving. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=137.36s)]
*  It's a few years ago, I think a lot of folks were focused on maybe Facebook, like you click [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=139.72s)]
*  on something you shouldn't. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=142.76s)]
*  Now it's immediate. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=143.88s)]
*  I get 10 spam text messages a day. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=144.88s)]
*  And it's easy to see how someone could fall susceptible to that. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=148.16s)]
*  So talk to us a little bit about, are you getting buy-in across the aisle here? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=151.72s)]
*  There are so few places, it seems these days, of bipartisan consensus in Washington. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=156.12s)]
*  Are you hopeful that you can work with your colleagues across the aisle to get something done? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=160.76s)]
*  Yeah, there is real concern here. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=164.72s)]
*  All of our constituents are being affected by this. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=167.23999999999998s)]
*  AI allows the criminals to personalize these scams, to make them more believable. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=170.84s)]
*  And because they can make them unique, it's harder to detect patterns in these scams. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=176.84s)]
*  So it is really important, first of all, that people go to my website, hassen.senate.gov, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=181.84s)]
*  to fill out that survey so we get a really up-to-date, on-the-ground look at what kind [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=187.72s)]
*  of scams are being perpetrated. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=192.6s)]
*  It's also really important for people to understand that these scams will come across in a way [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=194.76s)]
*  that often makes you think you're dealing with an organization you know. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=201.88s)]
*  They can spoof the caller ID, for instance. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=205.2s)]
*  They often will have an incentive or a prize involved. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=207.88s)]
*  They will give you a sense of urgency. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=211.96s)]
*  Do this now or something terrible will happen to somebody you care about. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=214.76s)]
*  And lastly, they will often be very specific about the kind of payment they want you to [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=218.52s)]
*  make, particularly making cryptocurrency payments. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=222.84s)]
*  So I'm urging viewers not only to fill out my survey, but if you get that kind of email [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=226.52s)]
*  or text or phone call, hang up, contact local law enforcement, or go to reportfraud.ftc, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=231.12s)]
*  because the FTC, the Federal Trade Commission, also has a role to play here. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=238.72s)]
*  But what I'd like to do is work with my colleagues across all these sectors, once we launch this [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  get more information, to really begin to coordinate the response in a way that will really help [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  us tackle this. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  We won't do it all in one fell swoop, but we can make real progress here. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=256.92s)]
*  Senator Einstein-Deutsch, while we have you here, the big, beautiful bill, what are you [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=262.72s)]
*  hearing inside your area from both sides of the aisle? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=265.88s)]
*  Look, people are really, really concerned and upset that this awful bill passed despite [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=268.92s)]
*  bipartisan opposition. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=276.04s)]
*  In my state, which has a large rural population, our rural health care providers are particularly [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=277.96000000000004s)]
*  concerned. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=284.76s)]
*  One of them just announced the closing of a clinic in one of our towns because they [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=285.92s)]
*  just said the numbers won't add up. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=289.92s)]
*  I met with a major health care system yesterday. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=292.12s)]
*  They are doing the math, but they are looking at the reduction of services. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=295.6s)]
*  This is going to mean longer drives and longer wait times for critical health care. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=298.84000000000003s)]
*  It's going to drive the cost of health care up as well as other things like groceries [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=304.72s)]
*  up and energy costs up for my constituents. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=309.56s)]
*  People are really upset that it passed. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=313.04s)]
*  They're paying very close attention. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=315.04s)]
*  They want us to fight back in every way we can. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=317.6s)]
*  I continue to try to make sure that people understand what's in the bill, who's responsible [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=321.16s)]
*  for it. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=327.4s)]
*  We also got to continue to find ways to move forward and try to reverse some of the worst [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=328.64s)]
*  things in this bill. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=334.68s)]
*  I'm hoping some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will listen to their constituents [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=336.15999999999997s)]
*  because this isn't a red or blue issue. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=340.91999999999996s)]
*  This is ripping away health care and food assistance and clean energy just to give tax [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=344.0s)]
*  breaks to the ultra wealthy. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=349.71999999999997s)]
*  Democratic Senator Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, thank you very much for coming on the show [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=352.44s)]
*  this morning. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=358.03999999999996s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=359.03999999999996s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=360.03999999999996s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYKlvTqNh9g&t=364.64s)]
