# My book doesn't have answers but questions: Gen. Stanley McChrystal on 'On Character'
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo)
*  A new book is examining the importance and the absence of character in American politics. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=0.0s)]
*  It's titled Character, Choices that Define a Life. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=5.76s)]
*  And then that retired four-star U.S. Army General Stanley McChrystal writes about the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=8.92s)]
*  constructive ways we can all live more principled and fulfilling lives. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=13.72s)]
*  And General Stanley McChrystal joins us now. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=18.64s)]
*  General, such an honor to have you with us again. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=20.68s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=22.84s)]
*  Thanks so much for having me. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=23.84s)]
*  You know, I interviewed Graydon Carter about a month ago, and he said he always told his [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=26.24s)]
*  children that character was built over the boneyard of failures. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=32.28s)]
*  And in your book, you talk about character. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=38.12s)]
*  You have a formula that I find to be very compelling. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=41.16s)]
*  But what I really find compelling is when you write about the fact that it took an inflection [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=44.96s)]
*  point for you to stop and re-examine. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  You know, it's easy to talk about character when the music's going, when everything's [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=53.72s)]
*  perfect, when you're pursuing your life plan. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=58.16s)]
*  But you talk about a time when for you, everything stopped and it made you re-examine your life [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=62.8s)]
*  and re-examine what character was. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=69.56s)]
*  Tell us about that. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=71.84s)]
*  Well, thanks, Joe. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=72.84s)]
*  Of course, I'd had a life where I'd been trained in character and educated in it, but I hadn't [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=73.84s)]
*  thought a lot about it, as you say. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=78.6s)]
*  And then in the summer of 2010, when a magazine article came out, Rolling Stone magazine, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=80.92s)]
*  I offered my resignation to President Obama, and he accepted it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=86.52s)]
*  And I didn't like the article, didn't think it was accurate, but it doesn't matter. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=91.96000000000001s)]
*  I was responsible, and I had no problem accepting that responsibility. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=95.0s)]
*  But it cut my legs out from under me, because in that moment, I was no longer a commander, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=101.7s)]
*  I was no longer a general, I was no longer even a soldier. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=106.28s)]
*  And I'd been born in an Army hospital, I'd gone to West Point at age 17, I'd been in [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=110.28s)]
*  my career for 34 years after West Point, I'd been married to an Army brat who'd been with [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=115.04s)]
*  me for 33 years at that point. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  And suddenly, we were in an entirely different place. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=123.52s)]
*  And I remember walking out of the Oval Office, and I was in shock, because I always thought [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=127.88s)]
*  I could be killed in combat or I could be fired for incompetence, but I'd never be accused [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=132.76s)]
*  of anything like disloyalty or that. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=138.12s)]
*  And as I went over to our quarters at Fort McNair, I'd flown back all night from Afghanistan, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=141.44s)]
*  I left the Oval Office and went back into our quarters, and my wife Annie was waiting for [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=149.04000000000002s)]
*  me, and I walked in and said, it's over. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=153.12s)]
*  He accepted my resignation. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=156.92000000000002s)]
*  And she goes, good. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=159.44s)]
*  We've always been happy, and we will always be happy. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=161.56s)]
*  And in that moment, she said, of course, Ford, not back, and I joke with people that Annie [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=164.76s)]
*  lives her life like she drives with no use for the rearview mirror. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=170.28s)]
*  But what it made me do, because for quite a long time, I felt like I was an absolute [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=177.79999999999998s)]
*  failure. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=183.44s)]
*  You know, I'd walk through airports and I'd see people talking and kind of looking at [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=184.44s)]
*  me, not pointing, and I knew they were talking about me because they recognized me, and I [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=187.84s)]
*  assumed they were talking bad things. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=192.16000000000003s)]
*  Later, people would talk to me, and that was probably mostly in my head, but it was there. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=194.44000000000003s)]
*  And so I went through quite a long period of reflecting who I am, what I am, and then [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=201.12s)]
*  this book is really 15 years of exploration of what is my character. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=206.92000000000002s)]
*  I don't have answers in this book for anybody. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=212.12s)]
*  What I have is questions that I took on, and I would invite other people to look at the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=215.44s)]
*  questions and see if they might not be worthy of them asking themselves. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=219.92s)]
*  We were talking a minute ago in the break, General, about the state of character today [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=223.68s)]
*  in this country and why you and I, and I think everyone at this table, believe it is still [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=227.35999999999999s)]
*  so important. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=231.88s)]
*  And we try to tell our kids that despite what they see in public view as rewards for people [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=232.88s)]
*  who have low character, people who are not kind or generous or strong in the ways that [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=238.88s)]
*  you and I might view strength. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=243.64s)]
*  So have we lost some of character in our culture? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=245.44s)]
*  I think we de-emphasized it. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=249.72s)]
*  You know, if you watch movies about special operators, and I had the chance to work with [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=252.08s)]
*  our best for many years, you have this idea that they are very competent, but they're [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=255.82s)]
*  just razor sharp. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=261.18s)]
*  And when you go through the selection and assessment programs for the SEALs or Delta [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=263.16s)]
*  Force or the Rangers, very few people flunk. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=268.28000000000003s)]
*  Almost nobody fails because they can't shoot or they're not strong enough, they're not [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=272.8s)]
*  smart enough. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=275.76s)]
*  The people who fail quit. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=276.92s)]
*  What this selection and assessment is looking for is character because they can train everything [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=279.44s)]
*  else. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=284.47999999999996s)]
*  And what that has turned out through years now and decades of combat is that character [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=285.47999999999996s)]
*  is the essential quality. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=291.4s)]
*  You need to know who you can count on when it's really bad. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=293.4s)]
*  As I've said about elected officials, you can never predict what crisis they're going [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=296.71999999999997s)]
*  to have to deal with because they're always emerging. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=300.79999999999995s)]
*  But you do know that crises will come and you do know that ultimately character will [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=303.91999999999996s)]
*  be the most important fulcrum around which everything depends. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=308.64s)]
*  And so I think we don't talk about it enough. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=314.15999999999997s)]
*  I would argue we don't think about it enough. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=317.47999999999996s)]
*  And what I want to do is help start a national conversational character, maybe starting with [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=319.56s)]
*  young people, whatever groups do it, and just put it back up and say, should character be [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=324.59999999999997s)]
*  something we look at for everybody we consider, for a CEO job, for elected office, for anything? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=330.88s)]
*  So I'm curious, you were telling your story and how you took responsibility regardless [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=337.76s)]
*  of how much you agreed with everything that had come out in Rolling Stone. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=344.59999999999997s)]
*  Character overall, isn't a key factor of that accountability? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=348.96s)]
*  Whether you stay in a leadership position in the military or not, isn't that what engenders [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=355.24s)]
*  trust in the ranks? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=363.0s)]
*  And that could also be translated to voters. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=365.72s)]
*  Completely. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=368.52000000000004s)]
*  And sometimes it's very painful because if you have to accept responsibility, maybe you [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=369.76000000000005s)]
*  don't think it's entirely fair or justified. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=374.24s)]
*  But it's important for the system for people below you to watch you accept responsibility. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=376.90000000000003s)]
*  The Navy for years, captains of ships, has accepted responsibility for what happens, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=382.04s)]
*  even though they might be asleep when the ship has an accident. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=386.56s)]
*  And on the one hand, it seems tough. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=390.68s)]
*  On the other hand, I think it's produced some really good culture. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPNLo7ajgUo&t=392.72s)]
