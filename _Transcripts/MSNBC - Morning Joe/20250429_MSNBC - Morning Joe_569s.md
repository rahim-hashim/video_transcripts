# 'Trump is trying to break us': Canada's Mark Carney wins election fueled by WH threats
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law)
*  Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=0.0s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=3.0s)]
*  Mike Myers? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=5.0s)]
*  What are you doing here? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=6.0s)]
*  I just thought I'd come up and check on things. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=7.0s)]
*  You live in the States? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=10.0s)]
*  Yeah, but I'll always be Canadian. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=11.0s)]
*  But you live in the States? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=14.0s)]
*  Yeah, so? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=17.0s)]
*  Do you remember Mr. Dress Up, the children's show on CBC? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=19.0s)]
*  What were the names of Mr. Dress Up's two puppet friends? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=22.0s)]
*  Casey and Finnegan? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=25.0s)]
*  Budda. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=26.0s)]
*  Spud? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=27.0s)]
*  Howie? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=28.0s)]
*  Nicholas Saskatchewan? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=29.0s)]
*  Regina? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=30.0s)]
*  Tragically. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=31.0s)]
*  Pip? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=32.0s)]
*  You're a defenceman, defending a two on one. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=33.0s)]
*  What do you do? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=34.0s)]
*  Tick away the pass, obviously. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=35.0s)]
*  What are the two seasons in Toronto? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=36.0s)]
*  Winter and construction. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=37.0s)]
*  Wow, you really are Canadian. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=38.0s)]
*  Yeah, but let me ask you Mr. Prime Minister, will there always be a Canada? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=41.0s)]
*  There will always be a Canada. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=46.0s)]
*  Alright, elbows up. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=49.0s)]
*  Elbows up. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=50.0s)]
*  That was comedian Mike Myers, a proud Canadian, appearing in an ad for the Liberal Party. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=51.0s)]
*  With Prime Minister Mark Carney last month, the head of national elections in Canada. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=59.0s)]
*  Mike, I've got to say, it is, I mean, I don't usually follow who's running the Bank of England every week. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=63.0s)]
*  So, I didn't realise, like, Mark Carney's been in the spotlight a lot before. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=71.0s)]
*  And I understood that he'd been involved in banking for a very long time and had been an important voice in economic issues across the globe. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=79.0s)]
*  But when I first saw that commercial, I was struck by the fact that actually, Mike Myers was Mark Carney's straight man. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=92.0s)]
*  And he carried that off so well and has such an ease about him. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=103.0s)]
*  And also, you know, Canada, as our good friend, J-Mart, said yesterday, he'd been borrowing a lot of division, a lot of the tough tactics from America in their politics. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=109.0s)]
*  And Mark Carney, you just see him in that ad. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=128.0s)]
*  You see him on the campaign trail. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=131.0s)]
*  And this is a guy who's calm. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=133.0s)]
*  He is, he's connected with voters and he's extraordinarily competent. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=136.0s)]
*  It is, it is Canada going in a direction actually opposite than how America's been going for the past 20 years with their politicians. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=143.0s)]
*  It's really telling. You could tell he's extraordinarily effective political talent for this time. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=154.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=162.0s)]
*  But again, that commercial, really one of the best political ads I've seen in a very long time. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=163.0s)]
*  And not because there's an SNL store in there, but because the real star of that ad is a guy whose name was on the ballot. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=169.0s)]
*  Right. Never in politics and yet he's a pro. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=178.0s)]
*  And very comfortable with this moment. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=181.0s)]
*  Mark Carney has won a full term as Canada's prime minister, marking a stunning turnaround for the country's Liberal Party. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=186.0s)]
*  Carney called for an election after he was sworn into the position following Justin Trudeau's resignation. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=194.0s)]
*  As of now, it is still unclear if liberals who have been in power for almost a decade will be able to secure a majority government. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=201.0s)]
*  When Carney took the stage to address his supporters last night, he mentioned Canada's relations with the U.S. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=209.0s)]
*  As I've been warning for months, America wants our land, our resources, our water, our country. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=217.0s)]
*  Never. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=226.0s)]
*  But these are not, these are not idle threats. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=229.0s)]
*  President Trump is trying to break us so that America can own us. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=233.0s)]
*  That will never, that will never ever happen. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=239.0s)]
*  But we, but we also must recognize the reality that our world has fundamentally changed. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=244.0s)]
*  We are once again at one of those hinge moments of history. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=254.0s)]
*  Our old relationship with the United States, a relationship based on steadily increasing integration, is over. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=258.0s)]
*  The system of open global trade anchored by the United States, a system that Canada has relied on since the Second World War, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=267.0s)]
*  a system that, while not perfect, has helped deliver prosperity for a country for decades, is over. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=277.0s)]
*  These are tragedies, but it's also our new reality. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=286.0s)]
*  We are over, we are over the shock of the American betrayal, but we should never forget the lessons. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=292.0s)]
*  But you're going to take this forward. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=300.0s)]
*  We have to look out for ourselves, and above all, we have to take care of each other. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=302.0s)]
*  All right, let's bring in the U.S. National Editor at the Financial Times, Ed Luce, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=312.0s)]
*  who's here to talk about the column he has up on the FT right now. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=318.0s)]
*  But Ed, you're also writing about Mark Carney. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=322.0s)]
*  And I'd love to get your thoughts on this moment. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=325.0s)]
*  And might Democrats look to the north for a model on an answer to Trump? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=329.0s)]
*  Well, I should declare, Mika, that I've known Mark since he was a PhD student in England in the early 90s. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=338.0s)]
*  His wife, Diana, who's English, said, come out for a drink with me with this Canadian doctoral student. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=346.0s)]
*  And so I've known Mark for 35 years. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=352.0s)]
*  And I have to say, I never expected to see this day, not because he's not supremely qualified to be Canada's Prime Minister, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=355.0s)]
*  but because his background as governor of the Bank of England, having worked for Goldman Sachs in New York, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=365.0s)]
*  all of these sort of smell of globalism to electorates that nowadays are really on the lookout for people who are allegedly elitist. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=372.0s)]
*  And I think in the space of a few weeks, Trump turned those electorally suspect credentials, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=385.0s)]
*  I mean, very substantive credentials, but electorally suspect ones, from being toxic into being absolutely key qualifications [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=392.0s)]
*  to manage Canada in an international climate where the economy is parlous [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=402.0s)]
*  and where you need somebody who knows how things work and what he's doing. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=409.0s)]
*  And so it is extraordinary to see this. He's really well qualified. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=415.0s)]
*  I just didn't expect him to win. And yesterday was the first time he's 60. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=419.0s)]
*  It was the first time in his life he'd ever stood for public office. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=424.0s)]
*  Ed, are you surprised by the speed with which this happened? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=428.0s)]
*  As we said a minute ago, conservatives just a couple of months ago were up by 20 points in the polling for this election. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=431.0s)]
*  And then as President Trump began his attacks on Canadian sovereignty, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=439.0s)]
*  continuing to talk about Canada becoming the 51st state of the United States of America, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=442.0s)]
*  and then of course the 25 percent tariffs, it really galvanized a national movement inside Canada to push back against America. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=448.0s)]
*  But boy, it happened in just a couple of months. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=457.0s)]
*  It did. And I mean, his opponent, who lost his seat, by the way, Pierre Polyèvres, the Conservative Party leader, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=459.0s)]
*  who had been forecast to be prime minister, you know, as almost a done deal for more than a year, a coming landslide, et cetera. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=467.0s)]
*  His opponent had this sort of Me Too Trump line, Canada first. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=476.0s)]
*  Carney changed it into Canada strong and thereby became the patriot in this race. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=481.0s)]
*  And Polyèvres, because he'd already sort of presented himself as essentially a Trumpian, he was in a prison not of his own making. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=488.0s)]
*  And when Trump starts threatening, you know, Canada's economic prosperity, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=497.0s)]
*  it's very difficult for Polyèvres to repudiate Trump because he's already presented himself as Trumpian. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=502.0s)]
*  And it ought to be said we're seeing similar dynamics happen in the Australian election, which is happening in a couple of weeks. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=509.0s)]
*  And this is without Trump threatening to annex Australia. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=518.0s)]
*  So even there, we're seeing the conservative, they're actually called the Liberal Party, confusingly, in Australia. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=522.0s)]
*  But the Conservative Liberal Party leader, Peter Dutton, is the Trumpian in the race. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=529.0s)]
*  He's not doing well. He's been sinking for the last hundred days. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=535.0s)]
*  And I believe that's no coincidence. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=539.0s)]
*  And Carney, despite being from the same party, would be an entirely different kind of prime minister than was Justin Trudeau. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=542.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWhgA13law&t=552.0s)]
