# Musk ‘wrecked the White House’s afternoon’ savaging Trump’s signature agenda
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo)
*  What a significant rift that has opened up between Elon Musk and President Trump, seemingly [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=0.0s)]
*  out of nowhere. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=6.8s)]
*  Almost as big as a rift between the New York Knicks and Tom Thibodeau, Jonathan Lemire. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=7.8s)]
*  We'll talk about that in just a moment. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=11.6s)]
*  Elon Musk, yes, Mika, is lashing out against the president's domestic policy bill, calling [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  it, quote, a disgusting abomination. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  Musk made that comment on social media yesterday, writing in part, shame on those who voted [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=22.0s)]
*  for it. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=26.64s)]
*  You know you did wrong. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=27.64s)]
*  Musk went on to say the legislation will increase the budget deficit to $2.5 trillion, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=29.2s)]
*  actually the debt, and burden American citizens. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=34.04s)]
*  He then suggested next year voters, quote, fire all politicians who betrayed the American [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=36.84s)]
*  people by voting for this bill. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=42.64s)]
*  The Post comes on the heels of Musk telling CBS News last week the budget bill undermines [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=44.76s)]
*  the work of his Department of Government efficiency. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=49.2s)]
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson responded to Musk's criticism of the budget bill, telling reporters [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=52.76s)]
*  He spoke to the Tesla CEO about the legislation on Monday. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=57.32s)]
*  Joining us now, the co-host of our fourth hour, Jonathan Lemire, is a contributing writer [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=87.32s)]
*  at The Atlantic covering the White House and national politics. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=101.63999999999999s)]
*  Also White House reporter for Axios, Mark Caputo, and co-founder of Punchbowl News, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=104.6s)]
*  John Bresnahan. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=109.6s)]
*  Great group assembled to talk through this. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=110.91999999999999s)]
*  Mark, I want to start with you because you had the first reporting yesterday for Axios [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=112.83999999999999s)]
*  about where this came from, this outburst from Elon Musk about the so-called big, beautiful [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=117.08s)]
*  bill, which he said last week, a bill can be either big or beautiful, but not both. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=122.44s)]
*  So what's driving his very public criticism of the bill? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=127.72s)]
*  Well, we're told that there were basically four inflection points for Elon Musk. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=131.52s)]
*  There was the EV tax credit that was just referenced by Speaker Johnson. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=136.26s)]
*  Starlink, which is a company that he owns, a satellite company, wanted a bid or wanted [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=141.2s)]
*  to control, we're told, the FAA's new air traffic control system. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=146.56s)]
*  He was a special government employee. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=150.72s)]
*  Again, it appears that he wanted to stay in that role, and the White House told him, no, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=152.52s)]
*  you can't buy statute. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=157.28s)]
*  And then lastly, and most recently and perhaps most importantly relative to when he came [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=158.64000000000001s)]
*  out and said this, Elon Musk's pick to be the NASA administrator, a friend of his or [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=163.44s)]
*  an acquaintance, Jared Isaacman, was summarily and unexpectedly canceled as Donald Trump's [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=169.66s)]
*  pick on Saturday night. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=177.18s)]
*  And there was a lot of suspicion that various White House staffers conspired to have this [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=179.14s)]
*  done as, according to one person who I spoke to, an FU to Elon Musk. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=184.04s)]
*  And after that, it seems, and I'm told and we see, Elon Musk got very sour on the bill. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=190.7s)]
*  He waited until White House press secretary, Caroline Levitt, was at the podium for maximum [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=197.82s)]
*  damage and then he released his post and just sort of wrecked the White House's afternoon [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=202.98s)]
*  with what he said. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=208.33999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, so here John Bresnahan is part of what he said. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=209.66s)]
*  I'm sorry, but I just can't stand it anymore. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=212.73999999999998s)]
*  This massive, outrageous, pork-filled congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=214.85999999999999s)]
*  Shame on those who voted for it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=220.78s)]
*  You know you did wrong. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=222.88s)]
*  You know it. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=224.35999999999999s)]
*  In November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=225.42s)]
*  That's Elon Musk's post yesterday. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=229.54s)]
*  So Bres, I guess the question is, does this matter for the lawmakers on Capitol Hill? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=231.1s)]
*  We heard Speaker Johnson saying, well, Elon, my dear friend just doesn't understand it. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=236.85999999999999s)]
*  I've reached out to him. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=240.66s)]
*  I'll explain it to him. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=241.66s)]
*  Elon, based on those statements yesterday, doesn't seem terribly persuadable. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=243.5s)]
*  Does this criticism from the world's wealthiest man, a close ally for a long time of President [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=248.45999999999998s)]
*  does it matter to the legislative process? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=254.38s)]
*  I mean, yes and no. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=256.42s)]
*  I mean, Republican senators, the Senate was in yesterday. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=258.9s)]
*  Republican senators couldn't run away faster from this question. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=261.97999999999996s)]
*  I mean, they were literally, I had one guy, a Republican senator sprint away from me, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=265.78s)]
*  literally sprint away from me. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=270.94s)]
*  What they were trying to say, oh, Musk is a private citizen. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=272.53999999999996s)]
*  This is his own opinion. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=275.46s)]
*  He's got, you know, as Mark in his excellent reporting talked about, you know, he's upset [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=277.21999999999997s)]
*  about the E.V. mandate. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=281.5s)]
*  And Mike Johnson, Speaker Johnson had raised this. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=283.98s)]
*  But this is a big deal. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=286.5s)]
*  You also saw Republicans who were have problems with this bill, like Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=287.7s)]
*  who told us reporters yesterday, he's like, you know, Musk is right. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=293.7s)]
*  This bill doesn't cut enough. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=297.18s)]
*  It's got to be redone. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=298.62s)]
*  And that's a huge problem for the House leadership, for Johnson, if the Senate tries to overhaul [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=300.66s)]
*  the bill. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=305.42s)]
*  And it's a problem for Trump. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=306.42s)]
*  And this is where we have an important meeting today. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=308.04s)]
*  We have the Senate Finance Committee Republicans. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=312.02s)]
*  These are the guys who do the tax portion of this bill and the Medicaid portion of this [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=313.02s)]
*  bill. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=317.26s)]
*  They're going down to meet with Trump and Senate Majority Leader Thiem will be with [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=318.26s)]
*  them. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=321.42s)]
*  And they know that Trump is the only one who can get Musk off their back if there's a problem [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=322.42s)]
*  on this. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=326.94s)]
*  So, John Lemire, two point three to five trillion dollars over the next decade, according [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=327.94s)]
*  to the CBO, this bill would add massive tax cuts and everything else that comes with it. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=332.86s)]
*  How does the White House grapple? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=338.5s)]
*  Does it care with the criticism from Elon Musk, a man who was standing in the Oval Office [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=340.26s)]
*  a few days ago? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=344.21999999999997s)]
*  Well, as noted, Musk's statement came as White House Press Secretary Karen Levitt was at [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=345.21999999999997s)]
*  the podium. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=348.65999999999997s)]
*  She was asked about it in real time and said, well, you know, she downplayed it. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=349.65999999999997s)]
*  So the president's aware of Elon's feelings about this, but he still stands behind the [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=353.06s)]
*  one big, beautiful bill, as in her words. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=357.21999999999997s)]
*  And then they quickly tried to push past it. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=359.58s)]
*  And we have not heard from Trump himself yet on this. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=361.3s)]
*  I think every reporter in Washington, myself included, always glued to truth social to [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=364.38s)]
*  see if Trump would respond to Musk. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=370.78s)]
*  He has not, at least not yet. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=373.14s)]
*  But at some point he will. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=374.98s)]
*  We do expect that he'll be in front of cameras today, which he has not been for the last [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=375.98s)]
*  couple of days. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=378.34s)]
*  So we may hear from him later today. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=379.34s)]
*  I think this is already going to be a messy process. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=381.82s)]
*  Yes, this got to the House just barely. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=384.38s)]
*  There were some people who opposed it, Congressman Massey, who gave Musk an attaboy already yesterday, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=386.74s)]
*  saying, yes, I share your concerns. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=391.21999999999997s)]
*  And Musk is not wrong in terms of how it's going to increase spending and that does fly [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=392.66s)]
*  in the face of what Doge was trying to do. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=396.62s)]
*  And Mark, of course, also laid out some of the other behind the scenes reasons why Musk [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=398.66s)]
*  opposed this. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=402.90000000000003s)]
*  The Senate was already had its real problems with it. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=403.90000000000003s)]
*  This gives them more fuel. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=406.14000000000004s)]
*  But I think, Mekhi, it also is just worth taking a second here just to go big picture [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=407.34000000000003s)]
*  at how remarkable this is. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=411.66s)]
*  Elon Musk spent a record amount of money, tens upon hundreds of millions of dollars, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=413.26000000000005s)]
*  to help elect President Trump. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=418.22s)]
*  He then, on January 20th, became the most, I'd argue, most powerful sort of government [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=419.78000000000003s)]
*  official we've had in a very long time. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=426.46000000000004s)]
*  Unelected government official, empowered by Trump to basically hand it in the keys to [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=428.78000000000003s)]
*  the government. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=433.14s)]
*  Do what you will. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=434.14s)]
*  And here, just four, four and a half months later, not only is he out, but he's out there [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=435.58s)]
*  savaging the president's signature piece of his agenda. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=440.7s)]
*  His entire legislative agenda is in this one bill. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8juqQckQlo&t=445.94s)]
