# 'I don't think it's worth it': Some GOP lawmakers think Qatari plane deal should stay on the ground
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk)
*  All right, President Trump is defending the possibility of accepting a luxury Boeing jumbo jet as a gift from the ruling family of Qatar. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=0.0s)]
*  The president says he plans on using the jet as a new Air Force one for travel until he leaves office. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=9.72s)]
*  The plane is then expected to be transferred to the Trump Presidential Library Foundation once his term ends. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  Yesterday, the president told reporters only a stupid person wouldn't accept this kind of gift. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=24.64s)]
*  If we can get a 747 as a contribution to our Defense Department to use during a couple of years while they're building the other ones, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=32.08s)]
*  I think that was a very nice gesture. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=44.24s)]
*  Now, I could be a stupid person to say, oh, no, we don't want a free plane. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=45.92s)]
*  We give free things that will take one, too. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=49.88s)]
*  And it helps us out because, again, we're talking about we have 40 year old aircraft. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=52.599999999999994s)]
*  The money we spend, the maintenance we spend on those planes to keep them tippy top is astronomical. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=57.879999999999995s)]
*  You wouldn't even believe it. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=63.72s)]
*  So I think it's a great gesture from Qatar. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=65.16s)]
*  I appreciate it very much. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=68.08s)]
*  I would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=70.72s)]
*  I mean, I could be a stupid person and say, no, we don't want a free, very expensive airplane. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=74.64s)]
*  But it was I thought it was a great gesture. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=81.44s)]
*  President saying only a stupid person would turn down the plane. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=83.72s)]
*  You could add an ethical president might turn it down as well. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=86.19999999999999s)]
*  Democratic lawmakers are expressing concern about Qatar giving the gift of a jumbo jet to the Trump administration. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=88.96s)]
*  But so too are several Republicans publicly sharing their apprehension. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=95.72s)]
*  The Hill reports Republican Senator Rick Scott of Florida said, quote, I'm not flying on a Qatari plane. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  They support Hamas. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=105.63999999999999s)]
*  I don't know how you make it safe. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=107.44s)]
*  Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia said, I think they should run the legal challenges to see if it's OK. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=109.28s)]
*  I'd be checking for bugs is what I'd be checking for. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=115.91999999999999s)]
*  We need to look at the constitutionality of it. Sure. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=118.8s)]
*  And here is what Cynthia Loomis of Wyoming and Rand Paul of Kentucky had to say. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=121.6s)]
*  What were you if the president was flying on a plane that the Qatari government provided? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=127.47999999999999s)]
*  It would make me consider the appropriateness of that. Yes. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=132.56s)]
*  He seems to intend to use it for Air Force One. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=141.28s)]
*  You have security. Well, they better sweep that plane from front to back. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=143.76000000000002s)]
*  The Constitution in Article Two talks about the president can't take emoluments or gifts from foreign leaders. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=153.28s)]
*  And so there is a provision in the Constitution says you can't do this. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=159.51999999999998s)]
*  I think it's not worth the appearance of impropriety, whether it's improper or not. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=163.28s)]
*  I don't think it's worth it. But no, I think it's a mistake. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=167.72s)]
*  And it's just bringing up something he doesn't need. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=170.88s)]
*  Converting the Qatari plane into Air Force One would require an overhaul that would take years to carry out, according to aviation and intelligence experts. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=173.95999999999998s)]
*  It likely would have to be dismantled part by part to ensure there were no listing devices or other security vulnerabilities. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=181.04s)]
*  And then we're talking about also this just becoming his plane after his presidency as well to travel the globe. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=189.28s)]
*  You know, we were talking to Senator Sester a minute ago. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=197.16s)]
*  If he someone bought him a lunch at the Capitol Grill, he'd be in trouble. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=199.96s)]
*  Now we're talking about 400 million dollar planes. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=203.60000000000002s)]
*  It is hard to know where to begin with this one. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=205.96s)]
*  First of all, there are such significant security concerns, as pointed out, even by some Republican senators. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=208.88s)]
*  Also Air Force One, of course, Air Force One, it is the signature American aircraft. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=214.16s)]
*  And we're going to have a foreign government, apparently, give it to us. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=219.52s)]
*  I want to push back. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=222.8s)]
*  Well, yeah. And John Meacham, this is where I'm first of all, we saw those even some hardcore MAGA types like Laura Loomer and Tim Pool and Ben Shapiro. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=223.8s)]
*  Other conservative voices say, no, this is a bad idea. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=232.16s)]
*  And this is where I'm contractually obligated to mention that Jimmy Carter was made to sell his peanut farm. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=235.76s)]
*  And yet Donald Trump is going to take a gift from the royal family of Qatar. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=240.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's one of these things. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=247.68s)]
*  Sometimes you wonder in the decade of madness that we've all been living in, trapped in sort of what sticks, what doesn't. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=249.6s)]
*  This is interesting, right? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=259.52s)]
*  This has a certain stickiness. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=261.04s)]
*  People, everybody flies. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=263.88s)]
*  Most people fly. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=265.44s)]
*  Most people don't like it. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=266.6s)]
*  And there's something about the fact that the president of the United States would personally benefit from his office in a way that isn't cryptocurrency, which at least I don't understand. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=268.96000000000004s)]
*  This is something everybody can connect to. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=289.96000000000004s)]
*  Everybody's that most people I've done it in the last seven days have stood in the line at Southwest. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=292.68s)]
*  There were not a lot of Qatari emirs there. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=298.56s)]
*  And so I think this has some both a constitutionally, it's clear, it seems to me, but there's a political element here, too, at a time when the economy is not soaring as rapidly as we were told it was going to. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=302.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. And for those of you at home thinking that John Meacham was talking about standing in line for Southwest Airlines, it's actually the Southwest General Aviation Terminal in Bell Meads International Airport. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=320.24s)]
*  There he gets on his own personalized 747 private jet. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=332.84s)]
*  Historians, I don't know if you know this, but historians make so much money that they go into this collective and they fly jumbo jets all across the globe. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=338.56s)]
*  Isn't that right, John? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=346.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, it's called... [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=347.44s)]
*  I'm joking. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=348.2s)]
*  It's called air McCullough. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=348.88s)]
*  Yeah, exactly, exactly. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=350.6s)]
*  So, Senator Tester, let's go from the Qatari jet to this trip diplomatically. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=353.88s)]
*  Tom Friedman made, I think, a pretty insightful point last week in an op-ed that he wrote, saying that it is it is significant that Donald Trump has decided to be an American president going to the Middle East and not stopping in Israel. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=360.12s)]
*  At least there's no plan yet. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=377.48s)]
*  Also, going around the Israelis, basically just throwing his arms up in the air within that in Yahoo and basically saying, forget it, I'm going to just negotiate the release for the American hostage myself. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=379.2s)]
*  I think President Trump may be discovering what Joe Biden fought for for so many years, trying to get the Israelis to stop doing things that not only were not in the best interest of the region, but also in many cases, especially if you look at the West Bank, not in their own self-interest in the long run. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=391.24s)]
*  Talk about the schism that we're hearing emerging between President Trump and Netanyahu and what impact that has. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=413.32s)]
*  Well, Joe, I think you're spot on. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=423.88s)]
*  And I think that the fact that he's avoiding Israel on this trip sends a hell of a message. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=425.52s)]
*  And I think ultimately what I hope ends up here, because I think the president does want to want to stop what's been going on in Israel and fix the problem. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=430.03999999999996s)]
*  Hopefully it allows him to be able to visit with Netanyahu and be able to come up with a solution that works for the Middle East. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=439.08s)]
*  And I think that's his goal. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=445.88s)]
*  And I applaud that. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=449.2s)]
*  But in the end, I think if Israel didn't pick this message up, they're tone deaf because the message is pretty clear, I think, to everybody around them that if you want to play in the Middle East, then you've got to play nice with others. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=451.08s)]
*  And there's been a lot of problems over the last few years. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJHBuAUfrk&t=465.76s)]
