# 'Prove it': Joe calls out WH for labeling most deported migrants as terrorists and gang members
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [April 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs)
*  Let's talk more about this with staff writer for The New Yorker, Jonathan Blitzer. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=0.0s)]
*  His new opinion piece for the magazine is titled, Donald Trump's Deportation Obsession. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=3.68s)]
*  Jonathan, good morning. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=8.56s)]
*  So where does this obsession come from? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=10.92s)]
*  Let's just start with that. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=13.32s)]
*  What's the guiding philosophy here? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=14.56s)]
*  I think Trump, more than really any other contemporary politician, has defined himself, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=16.68s)]
*  his own brand, as basically being someone who is going to enforce the immigration laws [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=21.36s)]
*  to a degree we've never seen before. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=25.36s)]
*  He's gone so far, in fact, that he's exceeded the existing laws. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=27.48s)]
*  And so he's promised a campaign of mass deportation. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  In the process of that campaign, where he's trying to prove to his supporters that he's [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=33.96s)]
*  willing to do anything and everything to treat immigrants harshly, he has started to do things [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=38.24s)]
*  that really raise major questions about the administration's suspension of the rule of [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  law, ignoring judges' orders, ignoring immigration judges' orders, ignoring federal judges' injunctions, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=49.16s)]
*  the Supreme Court's injunctions, and so on, invoking a law from 1798 to basically summarily [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=55.32s)]
*  deport people without any due process, branding them gang members without any evidence. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=62.3s)]
*  People aren't even sure what the charges are against them, and they've basically been [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=67.98s)]
*  shipped to what, in effect, is a legal black site in a third country. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=70.52s)]
*  And there are, obviously, there has been a wing of the Republican Party that has wanted [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=74.4s)]
*  this for a long time. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=79.32s)]
*  You write about that. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=80.32s)]
*  There's also, of course, when I was there, another wing that was sort of like the more [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=81.32s)]
*  Reagan wing, which was, let as many immigrants in as want to come in. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=85.08s)]
*  It's better for our economy. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=90.32s)]
*  But Donald Trump, though, if you look at his approval numbers, you know, they're upside [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=92.56s)]
*  down, especially on inflation, on the economy, on things they've never been upside down on. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=97.7s)]
*  But you look at his numbers on immigration, and they're up there. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=103.56s)]
*  They would far rather us be talking about immigration and Abreu Garcia than talking [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  about Jay Powell or the stock markets. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=114.72s)]
*  And they will tell you, please, they're thinking, please talk about immigration instead of Hegseth, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=116.68s)]
*  immigration instead of tariffs, immigration instead of the market, because his numbers [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=126.48s)]
*  are strong on immigration. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=132.8s)]
*  Well, you're zeroing in on something that I think has really befuddled Democrats, which [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=134.76s)]
*  is the fact that his numbers seem strong on immigration. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=138.96s)]
*  I do really think, and I insist, that although people in general, when you look at polling, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=142.44s)]
*  say, OK, they're OK with the idea of mass deportation or OK with the idea of increased [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=147.44s)]
*  immigration enforcement and so on, what we're actually seeing is something far harsher than [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=151.67999999999998s)]
*  anything he's promised, something far uglier than anything he said he would do. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=156.67999999999998s)]
*  I do think that by and large, if Americans followed closely what was happening to people [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=160.51999999999998s)]
*  who were caught up in this immigration enforcement dragnet, I do think they would be appalled. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=165.83999999999997s)]
*  But it's up to Democrats to really hold his feet to the fire. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=170.24s)]
*  And right now, I think they're anxious about it. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=172.72s)]
*  I think immigration is one issue. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=174.72s)]
*  But I think Abrego Garcia, as flawed as he is in many ways, if you look back at his history, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=176.84s)]
*  I'm talking about him as a person. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=186.04000000000002s)]
*  If you look at him as a person, that might not be somebody that people say, oh, this [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=187.60000000000002s)]
*  is who we want to go down and visit in El Salvador, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=192.88000000000002s)]
*  If you look at domestic violence, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=197.88s)]
*  And yet at the same time, that is breaking through. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=205.2s)]
*  I had a debate with a friend of mine who was like, oh, Democrats are so stupid. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=208.6s)]
*  I said, I'm not so sure they're so stupid. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=212.24s)]
*  I think this is so heinous that even with a guy that has a very complicated past, it [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=215.24s)]
*  is breaking through. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=224.76s)]
*  And what did we see on Joe Rogan's show? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=226.64s)]
*  Well, we'll talk about that in just a moment. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=229.23999999999998s)]
*  But you heard from his union where they were saying, bring our brother home. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=230.88s)]
*  Four House Democrats were in El Salvador yesterday in an effort to get Kilmar Abrego Garcia [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=235.07999999999998s)]
*  released and to demand updates on him and other migrants who are imprisoned there. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=240.16s)]
*  They're extremely harsh conditions at this prison where people are denied food and tortured [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=245.27999999999997s)]
*  and worse. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=251.83999999999997s)]
*  A trip comes just a week after Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen met with the wrongfully [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=253.32s)]
*  removed Maryland man and the members of Congress met with local human rights organizations [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=258.92s)]
*  and officials of the U.S. embassy. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=265.28000000000003s)]
*  Salvadoran officials denied their requests to meet with Abrego Garcia themselves. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=267.32s)]
*  And I do think, I think this case, against all odds, I think this case is breaking through [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=271.88s)]
*  with the American people. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=278.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=279.72s)]
*  You mentioned podcaster Joe Rogan. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=280.88000000000005s)]
*  Well, he's criticizing the Trump administration for its lack of support for due process in [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=283.12s)]
*  immigration deportations, like in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia's forced removal. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=288.36s)]
*  Here's some of what Joe Rogan said on his show last week. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=295.0s)]
*  I think due process exists for a reason. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=299.36s)]
*  And the reason is it is horrific for someone to be accused of something they didn't do, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=302.20000000000005s)]
*  to be imprisoned for crimes they didn't commit, and then live in a cell, live in a cage with [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=307.32s)]
*  a bunch of people who did commit. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=312.8s)]
*  Here it is, Benjamin Franklin, it's better a hundred guilty persons should escape than [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=314.59999999999997s)]
*  one innocent person should suffer. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=318.71999999999997s)]
*  That, that is wisdom that has survived hundreds of years. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=321.15999999999997s)]
*  It's incredibly accurate. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=326.15999999999997s)]
*  And it is the foundation of freedom. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=327.8s)]
*  We have to make sure that these people are actually guilty. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=331.36s)]
*  Otherwise we become monsters. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=334.71999999999997s)]
*  You can't, like, what is that, when you're fighting monsters, be careful that you don't become one. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=336.32s)]
*  Become one. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=340.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=340.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=341.4s)]
*  That's very important. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=341.92s)]
*  That's very important. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=343.2s)]
*  You know, you can't do that. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=344.4s)]
*  To support one side of this, you have to deny some like basic human values. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=347.2s)]
*  Either way, like to support just rounding people up and just assuming they're all gang members. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=354.24s)]
*  I'm not saying they're doing that, but this is the worst case scenario. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=360.03999999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=363.03999999999996s)]
*  They get a bunch of people in a room, they rope them all in and one guy is just someone's [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=363.6s)]
*  cousin picking someone up to give him a ride home. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=367.04s)]
*  That's possible. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=369.64s)]
*  And now you're back on the one innocent person and now you're right back. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=370.16s)]
*  And what if that dude is not doing anything wrong and he's got some stupid tattoos and [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=372.96s)]
*  they decide that this guy's a gang member and now you're in a prison in El Salvador [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=376.36s)]
*  and you're not even from El Salvador. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=380.2s)]
*  And now, you know, you were just a hairdresser or you were a tattoo artist. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=382.32s)]
*  Family man. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=386.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=387.04s)]
*  You came over here and maybe you got a green card and maybe you don't. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=388.04s)]
*  Maybe you were just given asylum because a lot of people from Venezuela were given asylum [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=390.8s)]
*  in America and then you get shipped to El Salvador where you're not even from El Salvador. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=395.28000000000003s)]
*  So that the fact that that exists scares the **** out of me. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=400.52000000000004s)]
*  The problem with things that are going in a radical direction and then there's an overcorrection. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=404.56s)]
*  So the overcorrection is lack of due process. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=409.88000000000005s)]
*  The overcorrection is like round them all up, ship them to jail. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=412.76000000000005s)]
*  Like that's like some things that you say when you're not thinking things through. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=416.6s)]
*  Like what do you do about all the criminals? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=420.20000000000005s)]
*  Take them all, send them to El Salvador. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=421.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=424.52000000000004s)]
*  What about due process? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=425.52000000000004s)]
*  No, **** that. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=426.52000000000004s)]
*  Well, here's the problem with that. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=427.52000000000004s)]
*  What if you are an enemy of let's not say any current president. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=429.40000000000003s)]
*  Let's pretend we got a new president, totally new guy in 2028. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=434.32000000000005s)]
*  And this is a common practice now of just rounding up gang members with no due process [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=439.28000000000003s)]
*  and shipping them to El Salvador. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=444.52000000000004s)]
*  You're a gang member. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=447.12s)]
*  No, I'm not. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=448.12s)]
*  Prove it. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=449.12s)]
*  You gotta go to court. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=450.12s)]
*  No, no due process. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=451.12s)]
*  That's dangerous, Joe. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=452.12s)]
*  That's dangerous. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=453.12s)]
*  That's dangerous. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=454.12s)]
*  That's dangerous. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=455.12s)]
*  That's dangerous. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=456.12s)]
*  That's we gotta be careful that we don't become monsters while we're fighting monsters. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=457.12s)]
*  Let's be clear. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=463.36s)]
*  Joe Rogan endorsed Donald Trump for president. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=464.36s)]
*  He's largely supportive of his agenda. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=465.92s)]
*  He's a hugely influential platform there. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=467.8s)]
*  And John, I was struck and Joe, I know you said so as well. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=470.52s)]
*  He kept going, this is frightening. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=473.44s)]
*  This is dangerous because there's sense. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=474.6s)]
*  First of all, even Mr. Abrego Garcia, others who are currently in that prison in El Salvador, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=476.16s)]
*  do not receive due process. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=480.04s)]
*  The Trump administration thinks they've picked the right villain. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=482.36s)]
*  That's what they've said. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=485.04s)]
*  They think that this is the person they want to scapegoat. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=486.04s)]
*  Not only are these people who have rights to due process, but there is this undergrowing [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=488.68s)]
*  fear that I think Rogan hinted at there. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=493.16s)]
*  Well, it might start with them, but it can move to other groups too, including any of [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=495.20000000000005s)]
*  us. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=499.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=500.0s)]
*  And the president, to be clear, is explicit on this point. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=501.0s)]
*  He said that he would like to send convicted Americans to this prison in El Salvador. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=502.52000000000004s)]
*  So this is not a hypothetical. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=507.88s)]
*  But I also think it's important to note that when people, when journalists, when lawyers [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=509.71999999999997s)]
*  have dug into the actual specifics of some of these cases, obviously it's impossible [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=513.4s)]
*  to dig into all of them because the government won't share any information. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=517.16s)]
*  But when people have dug into the specifics of these cases, it's become clear that the [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=519.8s)]
*  people the United States government is saying are gangsters and are terrorists are in fact [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=523.48s)]
*  not. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=527.32s)]
*  There is no evidence proving the government's claim. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=528.32s)]
*  And yet the government is hiding the ball and saying, well, no, trust us. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=530.72s)]
*  We have the information. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=534.52s)]
*  This is precisely why due process is so important. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=535.52s)]
*  You right now have 250 Venezuelans who are languishing in El Salvador in prison who [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=538.22s)]
*  weren't able to see the charges against them. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=543.78s)]
*  When we have looked in a few cases at the charges, we see that they're based basically [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=546.22s)]
*  on nothing, on things like gang tattoos that are, you know, the suggestion is somehow that [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=551.0s)]
*  these tattoos suggest gang membership. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=556.1800000000001s)]
*  We know for a fact that they don't. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=558.0600000000001s)]
*  Circumstantial evidence that people can contest. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=560.22s)]
*  And yet these people are being disconnected from their families, their lawyers. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=562.86s)]
*  It's impossible to communicate with them. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=566.78s)]
*  The only reason we know these people are in a prison in El Salvador is because the news [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=568.54s)]
*  media has broken the names of these people. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=572.42s)]
*  The United States government hasn't even shared that in federal court under judges orders. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=574.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=578.38s)]
*  And you know, that's something that Mika continually is concerned about and talks about all the [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=579.38s)]
*  time, which is we're focusing on Abrego Garcia. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=584.42s)]
*  And yes, that's a good thing. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=587.8s)]
*  But it's almost like we're forgetting the other 200, 300 that had the same exact thing [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=589.9399999999999s)]
*  happen to them. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=596.6600000000001s)]
*  And the White House thinks they can call them terrorists, call them gang members. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=598.02s)]
*  How do we know? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=603.34s)]
*  And again, something I haven't said on this show before, like Joe Rogan said, prove it. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=604.34s)]
*  You know, there's that great scene in Absence of Malice where Paul Newman just sits back [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=611.78s)]
*  in his chair and he goes, prove it. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=617.84s)]
*  And that's how I feel every time I see somebody in the White House going, oh, they're terrorists. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=620.34s)]
*  Oh, they're gang members because they have a Real Madrid tattoo or because they're wearing [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=625.4200000000001s)]
*  a Chicago Bulls jersey. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=629.46s)]
*  I mean, you're like, come on, you're going to have to do better than that. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=631.34s)]
*  And how stupid do you think we are? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=635.0200000000001s)]
*  Obviously, Joe Rogan not buying it. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=636.86s)]
*  And a lot of people that listening to Joe Rogan not buying it. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFJqQz3ggs&t=640.1s)]
