# Iowans slam Trump policies, grill GOP senator at raucous town hall
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY)
*  You're gonna bring that guy back from El Salvador? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=5.0s)]
*  Why not? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=6.0s)]
*  Well, because that's not a power of Congress. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=10.0s)]
*  The Supreme Court said to bring him back. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=15.0s)]
*  Yeah, but can they do it? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=17.0s)]
*  He's defying the Constitution. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=21.0s)]
*  You don't need to hold him accountable. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=23.0s)]
*  Trump don't care. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=25.0s)]
*  If I get an order to pay a ticket for $1,200 and I just say no, does that stand up? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=26.0s)]
*  Because he's got an order from the Supreme Court and he just said no. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=32.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=36.0s)]
*  He just said screw it. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=37.0s)]
*  The president of that country is not subject to our U.S. Supreme Court. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=39.0s)]
*  Trump, why don't you bring him back? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=44.0s)]
*  Why don't you bring him back? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=46.0s)]
*  He's doing things that are wrong. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=48.0s)]
*  I'm pissed. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=50.0s)]
*  Well, it appears the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia is not just a story for the media or the D.C. Beltway. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=51.0s)]
*  It appears to be breaking through to middle America as Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa was pressed about the deported man yesterday at his town hall, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=59.0s)]
*  something we were talking a lot about with Chris Matthews yesterday. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=71.0s)]
*  He was saying, people don't like this. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=75.0s)]
*  Good morning and welcome to Morning Joe. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=77.0s)]
*  It is Wednesday, April 16th. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=80.0s)]
*  Along with Joe and me, we have U.S. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=83.0s)]
*  special correspondent for BBC News and the host of Rest is Politics podcast, Katty Gay. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=86.0s)]
*  The host of Pablo Torrey Finds Out on Metal Arch Media, MSNBC contributor Pablo Torrey and New York Times opinion columnist David French is with us. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=92.0s)]
*  So, Joe, I thought that town hall and the small group of people, but it did seem to show that this story has filtered way past Washington. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=102.0s)]
*  That wasn't in, as Pat Buchanan would say, the faculty lounges of Harvard. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=114.0s)]
*  That wasn't in, you know, at a cocktail party in Georgetown. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=120.0s)]
*  That was in an Iowa town hall meeting in middle America. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=126.0s)]
*  And this is one of these stories. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=134.0s)]
*  You never know what stories are going to cut through in American politics. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=136.0s)]
*  This is one of these stories that have cut through. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=139.0s)]
*  First of all, because they've sent a man after admitting that they made a mistake. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=141.0s)]
*  They sent a man down to one of the worst prisons in the world, according actually to the president and also I think the president of El Salvador. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=148.0s)]
*  They take great pride in talking about what tough conditions there are down there. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=159.0s)]
*  That's number one. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=164.0s)]
*  But number two, you know, in Washington and New York, we all talk about, you know, defying the Supreme Court and what about the Constitutional Showdown. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=165.0s)]
*  You heard it right there again in middle America. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=176.0s)]
*  It's just like we'll talk about Harvard later today. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=178.0s)]
*  Nobody's crying, going to be crying, as Chris Matthews and others said. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=181.0s)]
*  Nobody's going to be crying about, you know, Harvard getting roughed up a little bit. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=186.0s)]
*  But at the same time, they don't want the federal government, conservatives or liberals, don't want the federal government ordering professors what to teach in class. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=193.0s)]
*  That is the that you talk about big government encroachment. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=205.0s)]
*  Right. So that's number one. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=211.0s)]
*  And then number two, they don't want the president of the United States defying the Supreme Court. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=212.0s)]
*  Now, now we're going to talk about whether he defied the Supreme Court or not. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=220.0s)]
*  There are a lot of scholars that say, no, actually, he hasn't defied the Supreme Court yet in the letter of the law. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=226.0s)]
*  Even if he has in the spirit of the law. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=232.0s)]
*  Right. But the Supreme Court, when they get this again, they're going to need to tighten up their ruling. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=235.0s)]
*  So that's one part of it. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=239.0s)]
*  But, Mika, I think the second part of it is extraordinarily important for the Trump administration to learn from. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=240.0s)]
*  You know, they they were too clever by half in Signalgate, if that's what we want to call it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=248.0s)]
*  I remember the morning before Jeffrey Goldberg released everything we said on this show, just admit you made a mistake. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=254.0s)]
*  It will be better for you in the long run. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=264.0s)]
*  And they wouldn't admit that they made a mistake. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=267.0s)]
*  And then the White House will tell you that that was the first big bump in the road for them politically. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=270.0s)]
*  It didn't have to happen that way. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=278.0s)]
*  Same thing here. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=280.0s)]
*  Say we made a mistake. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=282.0s)]
*  All right. They've already said that they can bring him back to the United States. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=285.0s)]
*  They can they can go through deportation process and then work with the courts to figure out where to deport him, where he can go safely. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=290.0s)]
*  And that's something again they win. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=301.0s)]
*  He gets deported if he's here illegally and and he doesn't get the sort of blowback. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=305.0s)]
*  But this isn't an issue that's going to go away. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=312.0s)]
*  And they need to figure that out. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=315.0s)]
*  And when they figure that out, you know, things will again we'll get to it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=317.0s)]
*  But things will get worse for them. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=324.0s)]
*  As the Wall Street Journal has said, has other constitutional scholars have said, he's alienating his allies on the Supreme Court right now and they need to quit while they're behind. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=328.0s)]
*  You [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k73Sl4nrkOY&t=358.0s)]
