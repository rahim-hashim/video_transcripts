# 'Devastating consequences': Doctor warns of dangers of removing fluoride from water
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o)
*  These will never pay taxes. They'll never hold a job. They'll never play baseball. They'll [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=0.0s)]
*  never write a poem. They'll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use a toilet [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=8.68s)]
*  unassisted. And we have to recognize we are doing this to our children, and we need to [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=14.8s)]
*  put an end to it. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  That was HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. yesterday discussing a new CDC report [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=24.44s)]
*  detailing a rise in autism among children. According to the agency, about one in 31 kids [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=31.400000000000002s)]
*  were diagnosed with the disorder by their eighth birthday in 2022. That is nearly five [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=38.56s)]
*  times the figure in 2000. Joining us now, physician and senior public health contributor [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=44.72s)]
*  Dr. Omer Awan. Thank you very much for coming on the show. Let's start there. Why are we [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=51.1s)]
*  seeing this uptick? Sometimes it's better reporting, but is there something else? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=55.78s)]
*  The diagnostic criteria for autism is broadened significantly, and this has allowed for many [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=61.58s)]
*  more milder cases of autism to be classified under the umbrella term autism spectrum disorder. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=66.56s)]
*  And the other thing about this, Mika, is that physicians and pediatricians in particular [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=72.54s)]
*  are doing a much better job screening for autism. So you go to a pediatric office and [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=76.54s)]
*  you'll get good questions about exactly social interactions, learning, and this has allowed [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=82.18s)]
*  many more children to eventually be diagnosed with autism. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=86.7s)]
*  So I want to get, there's a lot of interesting health news to get to here with you. A fluoride [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=90.48s)]
*  in the water and this new information about CT scans. But let's move to fluoride, which [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=94.52000000000001s)]
*  we have in our water for a reason. RFK Junior says he plans to tell the CDC to stop recommending [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=101.36s)]
*  fluoride in drinking water. Will this happen? And what will be the consequences? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=108.16s)]
*  Well, it could absolutely happen because in Utah already they've banned fluoride in drinking [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=113.28s)]
*  water and this Mika could really have devastating consequences for public health and oral health [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=117.52s)]
*  in particular. You know, the American Dental Association has said that fluoride in public [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=121.6s)]
*  water decreases tooth decay and cavities by 25% in both children and adults. And when [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=126.52s)]
*  we consider this, you know, this is really going to be devastating because remember 70 [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=132.68s)]
*  million Americans lack dental insurance. This is going to cause a huge uptake in cavities [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=136.24s)]
*  and this may cost the federal government. Why is he doing it? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  He believes that it could be harmful. And certainly at the concentrations that we see, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=144.84s)]
*  it is not harmful. And decades of research has shown that at the concentration of 0.7 [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=149.3s)]
*  milligrams per liter, we don't see harm. But when it's at higher concentrations like [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=153.88s)]
*  2 milligrams, 4 milligrams, it can cause certain adverse effects like tooth discoloration, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=158.2s)]
*  even bony abnormalities. But the research has shown that that doesn't occur at the concentration [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=164.16s)]
*  that currently exists. So this is in tap water, fluoride, public [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=169.4s)]
*  drinking. A lot of people drink bottled water and plastic bottles. Does that have fluoride [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=172.2s)]
*  in it? It does. Yeah, it does. Certainly, you know, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=177.2s)]
*  anything that has spring water, anything that comes from a public source has fluoride [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=179.96s)]
*  in it. And this has saved many people, probably yourself and myself from getting cavities. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=184.20000000000002s)]
*  So it's going to be interesting to see what happens next. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=189.68s)]
*  All right. There's also been a study that is highlighting increased cancer risk from [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=192.88s)]
*  CT scans. Tell us what the findings were. And I mean, where do we go from here? A lot [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=198.92000000000002s)]
*  of people really depend on them. Absolutely. Well, I think the important [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=204.4s)]
*  thing to remember about this study is that it was based on statistical modeling and not [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=207.96s)]
*  real patient outcomes. And what the study did was it showed that CT scans, which have [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=212.44s)]
*  ballooned significantly, I mean, more than 90 million CT scans are done yearly, can result [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=217.88s)]
*  in 5% of all cancers in America. Now, remember also, CT scans are very important. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=223.76s)]
*  I mean, they're critical in saving lives and detecting cancers earlier. They're critical [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=230.76s)]
*  in decreasing hospital stays for people that are in the hospital. And even they prevent [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=235.16000000000003s)]
*  invasive procedures from happening, and that has risks in itself. But with that said, there [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=241.96s)]
*  is a harm from the radiation from CT scans. People, the more CT scans you have, the more [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=247.60000000000002s)]
*  radiation you're going to cumulatively get. And then you can also have an increased risk [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=252.88000000000002s)]
*  of having cancer in the future. We got to go, but on a scale of one to 10, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=257.04s)]
*  RFK as HHS secretary has you how concerned? 10 being the highest. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=262.24s)]
*  10. Physician and senior public health contributor [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=267.64s)]
*  for Forbes, Dr. Omer Awan. Thank you very much for coming on this morning. Come back. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ1p1WghY-o&t=270.88s)]
