# 'We have to': Trump says U.S. to send more weapons to Ukraine
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [July 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE)
*  President Trump also was asked yesterday about Russia and Ukraine as the Russians [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=0.0s)]
*  continue to launch missiles and drones into Ukrainian territory. 71 people were [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  hurt in Kharkiv yesterday when drone strikes targeted apartment buildings, a [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=9.36s)]
*  kindergarten, and the regional draft office, that's according to local [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=13.66s)]
*  officials. President Trump asked yesterday about America's military [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  support for Ukraine. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=21.36s)]
*  Mr. President, are you planning to send more weapons to Ukraine? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=23.88s)]
*  We're going to send some more weapons. We have to, they have to be able to [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=27.68s)]
*  defend themselves. They're getting hit very hard now. They're getting hit very [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=31.6s)]
*  hard. We're gonna have to send more weapons. Your defensive weapons [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=35.6s)]
*  primarily, but they're getting hit very, very hard. So many people are dying in [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=38.6s)]
*  that mess. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=45.44s)]
*  I'm not happy with President Putin at all, but this is something that would [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=48.08s)]
*  have never happened if I were president. I'm disappointed frankly that [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=53.2s)]
*  President Putin hasn't stopped. I'm not happy about it either. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=57.599999999999994s)]
*  Jonathan Amir, you've written The Atlantic about the ongoing relationship [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=61.599999999999994s)]
*  between Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, a piece you wrote several weeks ago, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=66.52s)]
*  talked about how that relationship, one that Donald Trump had hoped to be far [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=69.96s)]
*  closer than past relationships between American presidents and leaders of Russia, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=75.4s)]
*  you talked about how it was fraying at the edges. We saw more of that yesterday. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=79.88s)]
*  I guess, first of all, tell us what your reporting is on the president's support [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=84.96s)]
*  for new weaponry for Ukraine, but also where you sense this relationship is [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=91.19999999999999s)]
*  going and how frayed that relationship is. And well, how long is the fuse? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  How long will Donald Trump continue to allow Vladimir Putin to basically mock [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=105.52s)]
*  him publicly before really pushing back hard? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=113.2s)]
*  To this point, it's been a very slow burning fuse. The president has certainly [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  shown more moments of public frustration, and I've reported private ones as well, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=121.12s)]
*  about Vladimir Putin, who is not only not stopping the war in Ukraine, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=126.28s)]
*  but is only ratcheting it up. The pace of his attacks, his drone attacks, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=130.84s)]
*  missile attacks on Ukrainian cities targeting civilians has only increased in [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=134.48000000000002s)]
*  recent weeks. President Trump has still been reluctant to really punish Moscow. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=138.84s)]
*  He has not supported the really aggressive sanctions bill that's now sitting idly [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=145.48000000000002s)]
*  by in the Senate, but he does want the war to end. The question is, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=150.20000000000002s)]
*  when will he take the next step to actually try to stop it, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=155.64000000000001s)]
*  to put pressure on Russia to say, look, it is no longer of interest to conduct [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=158.68s)]
*  this war. He hasn't pulled that lever just yet. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=162.0s)]
*  So, Jonathan, can I ask you, is that lever, the sanctions bill, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=164.4s)]
*  the bipartisan sanctions bill, is that what the president's ultimately waiting [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=168.60000000000002s)]
*  for if Putin just refuses to engage seriously? Is that the president's lever, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=173.08s)]
*  that sanctions bill, again, that has bipartisan support? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=181.56s)]
*  There are two, I am told. That is number one, and that would probably be choice A. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  He has not been willing to commit to it, though. The second would be to actually [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=190.08s)]
*  not just sustain, but increase the amount of American help to Ukraine in terms of [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=194.24s)]
*  weapons and the like. And we saw yesterday sort of a dizzying about face there from [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=199.44s)]
*  this administration. A couple of days ago, we had DOD pause weapons shipments to Ukraine [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=204.20000000000002s)]
*  from Defense Secretary Hegseth, a call from him, Richard. President Trump then saying, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=209.96s)]
*  no, no, we want to continue it. And late last night, DOD did announce that they [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=213.52s)]
*  would be sending more. Although I am told that they'd rather outsource this. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=216.56s)]
*  They'd rather have European partners step up with defensive missiles, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=220.52s)]
*  even like the Germans buying Patriot batteries from the US, then ship them to Ukraine than [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=223.67999999999998s)]
*  a direct assist. So this is the question here is, to Joe's point, is there a moment [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=228.2s)]
*  where do you see a moment coming? People you've talked to in the community where [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=234.2s)]
*  President Trump might actually get tough with Putin? And what would that look like? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=237.51999999999998s)]
*  We've been waiting for it for the entire first term. We're now been waiting for it [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=242.92s)]
*  for these months. Yesterday was a rare piece, a sliver of good news. Look, the devil [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=246.88s)]
*  will be in the details. What kind of arms, how much of arms for how long? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=252.48s)]
*  I find it hard. It's not just this pro-Russian position, which remains [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=256.24s)]
*  inexplicable, but the animosity towards Zelensky and Ukraine has not dissipated. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=260.4s)]
*  Let's be honest. What's so odd about this, Jonathan, is President Trump had a big [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=265.28s)]
*  idea that I think was right, that there was an opportunity for peace. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=270.8s)]
*  And what it required was, one, putting pressure on Putin, but two, disabusing or [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=274.56s)]
*  speaking tough love to Ukraine, saying, look, your definition of success can't be [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=279.92s)]
*  to liberate Crimea and all your territory. That's simply not realistic, but [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=284.92s)]
*  we'll give you enough help to defend yourself. And the administration hasn't [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=288.96s)]
*  been willing to do that. If they're finally willing to help Ukraine seriously [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=293.32s)]
*  and put pressure on Russia through sanctions and arming Ukraine, then [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=297.88s)]
*  actually, I think President Trump could get closer to this goal he wants, which [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=301.03999999999996s)]
*  is peace in Europe. I don't think it's fanciful to get there, but right now [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=305.44s)]
*  there's a total inconsistency between his policy and his goals, and he's got [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=309.52s)]
*  to narrow or eliminate that inconsistency. And if he does that, his diplomats [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=313.64s)]
*  will have a chance. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=317.64s)]
*  All right, President Emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations, Richard [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=319.96s)]
*  Haas, thank you, as always, for coming on the show this morning. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9XXV1A40YE&t=323.88s)]
