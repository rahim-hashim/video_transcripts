# Steve Rattner: Here's why Americans pay more for drug prescriptions
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI)
*  Steve Ratner, Steve, take us through the charts. Well I don't think I can live up [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=0.0s)]
*  to that. There will not be applause at the end of this, it might be booing. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=4.72s)]
*  We'll have applause. Let's just start with a quick surreal parallel universe [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  Trump moment because Trump put out this executive order on Sunday saying that [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=14.48s)]
*  this was the most consequential thing almost in the history of the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  country. He was going to lower prescription drug prices by [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=22.48s)]
*  30 to 80 percent. The executive order actually does nothing. He doesn't have [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=26.72s)]
*  the authority to do any of those things but then he said just recently, I heard [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=31.0s)]
*  it on way too early this morning out in the Middle East wherever he is, that a [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=34.96s)]
*  lot of Democrats were going to vote for this tax bill going through ways and [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=38.64s)]
*  means because it was going to lower drug prices. There's nothing in the tax bill [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=42.04s)]
*  that would lower drug prices so the president is off on one universe and the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=45.86s)]
*  world is on a different universe and but he is talking about a world that does [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=49.8s)]
*  exist. He's talking about a world in which drug prices are much more [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=53.0s)]
*  expensive outside the country than here. So if you look at all drugs and you look [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=57.08s)]
*  at these countries plus about 25 developed countries as a whole you can [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=62.0s)]
*  see that they that they pay about 36 percent of what we pay. In other words we [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=66.44s)]
*  pay almost three times as much. When you look at branded drugs the disparity is [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=71.5s)]
*  even greater and when you look at when you look at generics in fact it's the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=75.88s)]
*  other way around. Generics here are actually cheaper but branded drugs are [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=80.04s)]
*  what people pay attention to. Why do they pay attention to it? Because [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  while 90% of all the prescriptions written are written for generic drugs [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=88.36000000000001s)]
*  branded drugs are 90% of the cost because they cost so much. So drug [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=93.16000000000001s)]
*  prices are higher here and they definitely occupy a lot of people's [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=98.16000000000001s)]
*  wallet share. Why are they so much more expensive here than in Canada or other [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=103.2s)]
*  countries? Why do you have Americans actually traveling around to other [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=109.96s)]
*  countries to buy drugs? That's a great question Joe and there are really two reasons [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=113.39999999999999s)]
*  for it. One reason for it is because most other countries take Britain for example [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=117.72s)]
*  which has national health insurance they negotiate with the drug companies for [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=122.11999999999999s)]
*  the whole country at one time and they basically say here's what we're willing [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=126.44s)]
*  to pay the drug companies have don't have as much leverage so they lower their [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=129.64s)]
*  prices. Also versus our system where of course you have Medicare, you have Medicaid, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=134.28s)]
*  you have private insurance, you have people paying for it on their own. We [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=139.32s)]
*  have a very fragmented system so there's no equally large force operating against [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=142.44s)]
*  the drug companies. The other reason quite frankly is we're a wealthier [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=147.0s)]
*  country and we're willing to pay more and Europeans and others would simply [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=150.68s)]
*  say no to some drugs. We'll look at that in a minute instead of paying those high [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=154.28s)]
*  prices. Okay so when the drug prices go up do the stocks go up? Well that's an [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=158.07999999999998s)]
*  interesting question. You would think they would make a ton of money because [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=163.07999999999998s)]
*  it is a fact that drug prices have gone up much faster than inflation. It's a [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=165.84s)]
*  combination of reasons but it includes the fact that a lot of new drugs as [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=170.76s)]
*  we'll also talk about in a second are very expensive. So you'd think this would [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=174.28s)]
*  create a great environment for the companies. It's actually it's not bad but [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=178.32s)]
*  it's not been as great as people might think. So this is the S&P going back to [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=181.95999999999998s)]
*  the year 2000 and you can see the black line right there. This is an index of the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=186.12s)]
*  13 biggest drug companies so it looks like they way outperform although it [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=190.88s)]
*  comes back down a bit here. But two of those drug companies make Mungavi and [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=195.16s)]
*  Ozempic the two big weight loss drugs that have been such a bonanza. If you [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=201.28s)]
*  take those two companies out of the index in fact drug companies have [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=204.92s)]
*  underperformed the S&P they've not done as well and it gets a lot to the cost [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=208.68s)]
*  of developing all this stuff. So talk about how many drugs are sold in the US [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=213.2s)]
*  versus other countries. Right so we are developing a lot more drugs this gets [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=217.72s)]
*  back to the cost factor. Over the last 10 years we've been developing about 41.5 [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=222.64s)]
*  new drugs a year and that is about 50% higher than what it was back here. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=228.0s)]
*  A lot of the new drugs these greens are what are called biologics. They're much [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=233.0s)]
*  more expensive to develop I won't get into the details of that. So you're [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=237.48s)]
*  getting a lot more drugs at a much higher price but we also get more [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=241.16s)]
*  drugs. We had 212 new drugs sold over this five-year time period. Germany 149 [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=246.16s)]
*  UK 122 and this gets back again to cost and price and who's willing to pay the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=252.56s)]
*  most ie us and so we get the most drugs. So we do we do get something for [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=259.04s)]
*  paying as much as I just showed you that we pay for this stuff. Alright so [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=264.16s)]
*  morning Joe economic analyst Steve Ratner the crowd absolutely loves you. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=268.2s)]
*  We love you too. They just want maybe for your next set of charts you can you [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=273.36s)]
*  can do charts on the the differing political views of the Pope's two [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=278.92s)]
*  brothers. Oh there you go. I thought you were gonna say why don't we get an [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=283.76s)]
*  applause. Thank you very much. I know we need the Ed McIngin man. Hey Steve why [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=292.20000000000005s)]
*  don't you come over and next next this what we call them segments around here. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=302.12s)]
*  We'll talk a little bit more about drug prices and the Pope's brothers. And also [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=308.04s)]
*  coming up we're gonna go through more and also the Pope's brothers. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=311.96s)]
*  you [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7anTF_tTdMI&t=338.0s)]
