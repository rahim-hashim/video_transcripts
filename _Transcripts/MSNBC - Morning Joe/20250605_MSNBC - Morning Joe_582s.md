The Morning Joe panel discusses.

# Reckless, fiscal nightmare: Joe slams Trump spending bill for adding $2.4T to deficit
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk)
*  You know, anytime you ban people coming to the United States from other countries, it [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=0.0s)]
*  has a real impact. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=4.16s)]
*  But it is chiefly in service of trying to get us all talking about that or talking about [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=5.36s)]
*  the Biden investigation they launched today, instead of talking about the centerpiece of [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=9.84s)]
*  this story, which is this bill to make the rich even richer at the expense of everybody [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=14.76s)]
*  else. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=19.88s)]
*  Democratic Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut putting into context a series of moves last [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=20.88s)]
*  night from President Trump. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=27.12s)]
*  The president announced a travel ban to the U.S. for people from 12 countries and partial [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=28.36s)]
*  restrictions for seven others. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=34.0s)]
*  He also ordered an investigation into former President Biden and officials in the Biden [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=36.04s)]
*  administration for the use of the auto pen, a device Trump has himself admitted to using. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=41.0s)]
*  It all comes as... [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=47.8s)]
*  Hashtag robot president. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=49.8s)]
*  The things that are going out there now. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=50.8s)]
*  Continue to work through President Trump's massive tax and spending bill and its impact [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=52.96s)]
*  on millions of Americans. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=57.8s)]
*  Meanwhile, Elon Musk ramps up his pressure campaign to kill the legislation, calling [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=60.199999999999996s)]
*  on Americans to contact their representatives in Congress. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=66.0s)]
*  Plus, President Trump claims he spoke to Vladimir Putin for 75 minutes yesterday. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=69.6s)]
*  We'll dig into the big headlines coming out of that conversation. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=75.64s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  Good morning and welcome to Morning Joe. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  It is Thursday, June 5th. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=81.72s)]
*  A lot to get to this morning. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=84.47999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Willie, a lot to get to. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=85.92s)]
*  Chris Murphy basically going, talking about what we've said for some time. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=87.64s)]
*  The second term, trying to separate the signal from the ground noise. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=91.92s)]
*  The signal, obviously, all that everybody in Washington's focused on right now is Elon [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=96.60000000000001s)]
*  Musk and how many Republicans he can take with him going against this massive pork barrel [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  spending bill. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=108.36s)]
*  So we're talking about auto pens. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=110.4s)]
*  We're talking about, I'm sure, robot presidents will come back into play pretty soon. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=113.28s)]
*  This is really, this is what Washington, D.C., is focused on right now. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=121.28s)]
*  This bill and whether it's in a lot more danger of passing the Senate because of Elon Musk. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=125.52s)]
*  Yeah, we'll get into the details of this new travel ban from 12 countries in a minute. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=130.88s)]
*  The effects of that are very real on the people trying to immigrate to this country. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=135.6s)]
*  But as Senator Murphy said, President Trump obviously throwing a lot against the wall [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=138.84s)]
*  in the hopes of distracting people from a bill that yesterday the CBO said will inflate [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=143.64000000000001s)]
*  the debt by $2.4 trillion over the next 10 years and increase by almost 11 million people, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=147.72s)]
*  the number who lose health care because of cuts to Medicaid and changes to the Affordable [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=155.12s)]
*  Care Act. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=160.52s)]
*  So the impacts of this, if it is passed, are very real. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=161.52s)]
*  And as you guys point out, Elon Musk now is again from a distance this time, from outside [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=164.84s)]
*  of Washington, a central player in all this, Mika, because of the pressure he is putting [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=170.16s)]
*  on saying kill the bill, get rid of this thing. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=174.32s)]
*  It's going to crush people on health care. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  It's going to cut, crush people on the debt and drive this country into a ditch, effectively, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=180.54s)]
*  is what he's saying. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=185.68s)]
*  So now you have these members of Congress, including Speaker Johnson and senators, many [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=186.68s)]
*  of whom, by the way, their campaigns were bankrolled by Elon Musk in many ways, feeling [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=190.56s)]
*  pressure both from the White House and from the world's wealthiest man. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=195.76s)]
*  It's very convoluted, but Elon Musk is ramping up its criticism of President Trump's legislative [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=200.6s)]
*  agenda calling on senators to kill the bill. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=206.28s)]
*  In a series of social media posts yesterday, the Tesla CEO tried to rally Republicans against [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=209.96s)]
*  the legislation urging voters to call their senators and congressmen, writing, quote, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=215.84s)]
*  bankrupting America is not OK. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=221.28s)]
*  Musk also suggested drafting a new bill that won't add to the national debt. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=224.92000000000002s)]
*  The comments mark what appears to be an escalation in the rift between Musk and the Trump administration. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=230.36s)]
*  One senior White House official telling NBC News President Trump is now considering how [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=237.32s)]
*  and when to respond, adding he was, quote, caught off guard, but not entirely surprised [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=242.4s)]
*  by Musk's opposition. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=248.16000000000003s)]
*  Meanwhile, House Speaker Mike Johnson had this to say. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=250.16000000000003s)]
*  Elon and I left on a great note. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=255.4s)]
*  We were texting one another, you know, happy texts, you know, Monday. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=256.6s)]
*  And then and then yesterday, you know, 24 hours later, he does a 180 and he comes out [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=260.36s)]
*  and oppose the bill. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=265.12s)]
*  And it surprised me, frankly. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=266.12s)]
*  I think he's he's flat wrong. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=267.32s)]
*  I think he's he's way off on this. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=268.96000000000004s)]
*  And I've told him as much and I've said it publicly and privately. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=270.84000000000003s)]
*  I'm very consistent in that. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=273.52000000000004s)]
*  But am I concerned about the effect of this on the midterms? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=274.88s)]
*  I'm not. Let me tell you why. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=277.72s)]
*  Because when the big beautiful bill is done and signed into law, every single American [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=278.76s)]
*  is going to do better. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=282.92s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=285.12s)]
*  Much is every American going to do better. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=285.92s)]
*  And what about Elon? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=288.76s)]
*  I guess that's what speakers have to do. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=290.16s)]
*  I don't know. They have to put together big, horrible bill, a pork barrel bill. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=292.04s)]
*  I mean, let me just be really clear here. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=298.24s)]
*  This bill would never pass when when when when we served and we balanced the budget [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=300.52s)]
*  four years and four years in a row and actually ran a budget surplus for two years. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=307.15999999999997s)]
*  Part of the reason why is these huge, massive bills never went through, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=313.2s)]
*  because what happens is when you have leadership working with the White House, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=318.4s)]
*  any White House, any leadership, and they try to jam everything into one bill, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=323.03999999999996s)]
*  there's so much in there that that that you're going to be shocked. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=328.08000000000004s)]
*  We've seen it from everybody, from Marjorie Taylor Green being shocked [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=332.88s)]
*  that the AI forces basically were out and the lobbyists got it. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=337.04s)]
*  So no states can do anything, can touch. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=341.32000000000005s)]
*  AI are regulated at all for like a decade or so. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=345.52000000000004s)]
*  And you have other people seeing spending pork barrel spending bills in there. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=349.20000000000005s)]
*  We have a thirty seven trillion dollar debt. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=353.0s)]
*  And as Willie said, this adds two point four trillion more dollars [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=356.2s)]
*  to a debt that's going to already grow by twenty trillion dollars over the next decade. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=361.52000000000004s)]
*  That's unsustainable. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=367.44s)]
*  That's going to lead to a fiscal meltdown. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=369.0s)]
*  Jamie Dimon is right. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=371.48s)]
*  That's going to lead to a bond meltdown. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=372.56s)]
*  This isn't even a close call. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=374.96000000000004s)]
*  This has nothing to do with politics, nothing to do with politics. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=377.40000000000003s)]
*  This is just pure, simple math. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=381.92s)]
*  And it's as if these House Republicans who claim to be conservative, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=384.76s)]
*  it's as if these House Republicans, they see this [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=390.56s)]
*  that the House on fire and they run to it. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=394.2s)]
*  Thirty seven trillion dollar debt, they run to it [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=398.03999999999996s)]
*  and they throw trillions of gallons of gasoline on the fire to have it explode, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=400.76s)]
*  specifically two point four trillion dollars worth of debt added on. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=404.96s)]
*  No ideology. This is black and white. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=411.36s)]
*  By the way, this is something that Democrats, my Democratic friends [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=413.72s)]
*  and Republican friends need to understand. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=416.28000000000003s)]
*  The game is over. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=419.28000000000003s)]
*  The gig is up. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=421.20000000000005s)]
*  You can't keep kicking the can down the road. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=422.96000000000004s)]
*  But that's exactly what this bill does. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=426.28000000000003s)]
*  We can't afford it anymore. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=429.44000000000005s)]
*  And we especially can't afford it, Willie. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=431.40000000000003s)]
*  As you said, adds two point four trillion dollars to the debt. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=433.36s)]
*  Going to take 10, 11 million people off of insurance. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=437.6s)]
*  So much of that is going to be gutting rural health care. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=441.24s)]
*  When you got Medicaid, you got rural health care. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=444.76s)]
*  So this is this is how bizarre things have gotten in Washington, D.C. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=448.08s)]
*  Think about it. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=453.08s)]
*  You have House Republicans who claim to be for the working man. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=455.4s)]
*  House Republicans are going to gut rural health care [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=460.03999999999996s)]
*  to give tax cuts to the richest billionaires in Silicon Valley and Wall Street. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=465.48s)]
*  Let me say that again, because nobody's doubting this. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=470.96s)]
*  This is that I mean, everybody knows this. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=474.32s)]
*  You talk to rural hospitals, you talk to to any health care provider in rural America. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=477.03999999999996s)]

*  And for what? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=491.24s)]

*  and billionaires on Wall Street, hedge funders. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=498.47999999999996s)]
*  So they can get even more tax cuts. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=503.0s)]
*  The rich can get richer and the poor. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=506.4s)]
*  Well, the poor just lose their health care, Willie. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=508.4s)]
*  I'm sorry. I don't I don't know where Mike Johnson thinks his members are going to be [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=510.64s)]
*  running over the next two years, but they're going to be running in red state [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=515.6s)]
*  America where they're going to be a lot of people who are going to be hurt by this bill. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=518.84s)]

*  But the fact is, this is a type of bill no conservative would ever vote for ever. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=526.72s)]
*  It's reckless. It's irresponsible. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=535.2s)]
*  And it's a fiscal nightmare. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=537.48s)]
*  And people who've built their careers on being fiscal conservatives and saying that [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=539.76s)]
*  we've got to shrink the size of government. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=544.44s)]
*  And yet here you have two point four trillion dollars. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=546.4s)]
*  Republicans saying there are one point three trillion dollars of cuts in this package [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=548.96s)]
*  over a decade. True. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=553.36s)]
*  But there are also three point seven trillion dollars in lost revenue because of the tax [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=555.1600000000001s)]
*  cuts, as you just pointed out. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6vCzsjkkk&t=560.0400000000001s)]
