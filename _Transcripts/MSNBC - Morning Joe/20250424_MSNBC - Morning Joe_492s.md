# Time to pass the torch: Sen. Durbin on why he won't seek re-election
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c)
*  Joining us now, Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=0.0s)]
*  He's the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee and has severed as Senate Democratic Whip [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  since, has served as Senate Democratic Whip since 2005. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=10.08s)]
*  He announced yesterday he will not be seeking reelection. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=14.48s)]
*  And that was quite a big piece of news that came over yesterday, Senator. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=19.52s)]
*  Your thoughts this morning on your decision, especially during these turbulent times. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=24.52s)]
*  One of my friends in politics used to say, you should leave at a time when you still [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=31.6s)]
*  might want to stay and people might want you to stay. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=35.56s)]
*  I think I'm at that moment in my career. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=38.76s)]
*  It's a personal decision to run for the Senate as a two-year undertaking. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=41.64s)]
*  Serving in the Senate is a six-year term, so I looked at eight years and said, I think [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  it's time for me to pass the torch on to another candidate. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=51.96s)]
*  So let's talk about the politics of the moment. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=55.6s)]
*  And from Ukraine to tariffs, there are some things that are happening that could have [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=58.36s)]
*  pretty long-term consequences, not only on the world order, but on the U.S. economy. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=65.04s)]
*  Can you comment, sir, on how the tariffs impact your state and what your biggest concerns [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=71.12s)]
*  are? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=76.12s)]
*  Devastating. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=77.12s)]
*  That's the word I use. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=78.12s)]
*  You know, farmers from my state depend on exports for their livelihood, and their exports [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=80.56s)]
*  are going to be the first to be undermined by any trade war that this president undertakes. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=87.32000000000001s)]
*  I've had CEOs of major corporations who I've never spoken to before call me in my office [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=92.48s)]
*  in Washington and ask me, what in the hell they're supposed to do? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=98.06s)]
*  They have critical elements that are coming in from overseas to make products that employ [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=101.48s)]
*  people in my state, and they don't know where to turn. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=107.4s)]
*  That uncertainty is reflected in the stock market and other places. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=110.56s)]
*  So I would say this trade war that this president has single-handedly decided to initiate is [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=114.18s)]
*  a disaster for the economy of my state and this country. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=119.4s)]
*  So Senator, Mika just mentioned Ukraine. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=123.08000000000001s)]
*  We want to get your reaction to something we just got from President Trump a moment [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  ago on Truth Social, saying, quote, I'm not happy with the Russian strikes on Kiev. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=128.08s)]
*  There's been a number this morning. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=132.8s)]
*  Not necessary in very bad timing. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=134.68s)]
*  Vladimir, stop. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=136.64000000000001s)]
*  President using the president of Russia's first name there. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=138.8s)]
*  What is your response to this? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=141.72s)]
*  You've seen as this peace process to this point, yes, some stern words from President [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=144.12s)]
*  Trump today for Moscow, but to this point, his administration largely not asking Russia [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=147.76000000000002s)]
*  to give up much while asking Ukraine for a lot of concessions. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=153.08s)]
*  I remember the president's kind of idle claim that he needed about 24 hours to figure out [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=156.92000000000002s)]
*  this war in Ukraine. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=162.20000000000002s)]
*  It's much more complex. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=164.0s)]
*  And secondly, he has to understand that Mr. Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, is fighting [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=165.52s)]
*  for the values which define the United States of America. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=170.4s)]
*  This just isn't another trade war or skirmish in another country. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=173.84s)]
*  It's so basic and fundamental. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=177.76s)]
*  And I would say this, an appeal, and I don't know if it'll go anywhere, but we're about [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=180.04s)]
*  to bury one of the greatest popes, I think, that has served in my lifetime. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  Wouldn't it be significant for the world to say we're going to have a Francis Day in [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=189.44s)]
*  this world? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=194.35999999999999s)]
*  We're going to stop the wars in Gaza. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  We're going to stop the war in Ukraine and the other conflicts. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=197.48s)]
*  We're going to feed the people in Sudan, and we're going to do acts of kindness in memory [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=202.68s)]
*  of this pope. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=206.64s)]
*  It would be, I think, significant for us to have a Francis Day around this world. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=207.64s)]
*  And certainly the pope relentlessly called for an end to the fighting both in Ukraine [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=211.92s)]
*  and Gaza. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=216.48s)]
*  Senator, yesterday after you made your announcement that you would not be seeking re-election, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=217.51999999999998s)]
*  there were a number of Democrats who privately really applauded your choice, saying that [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=221.51999999999998s)]
*  it was something, the right thing to do, to step aside and perhaps let a younger generation [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=224.92s)]
*  of politicians step to the forefront. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=229.32s)]
*  We know the idea of Democrats, elected officials, and age has been a hot topic in recent years. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=231.67999999999998s)]
*  Do you hope, do you agree with that thinking? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=238.64s)]
*  Do you think it is time now for younger politicians, the next generation, to come forward? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=240.6s)]
*  Well, I think it's more complex. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=247.6s)]
*  It is not just a question of a number, what your age is. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=249.72s)]
*  Look at Bernie Sanders, for God's sake, still drawing thousands and thousands of people [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=252.42s)]
*  out for rallies, and he's a few years older than I am. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=256.48s)]
*  The bottom line is, are you competent? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=260.8s)]
*  Can you still do the job? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=262.8s)]
*  That's the question the voters should ask. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=264.4s)]
*  But should a new generation be interested in public service? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=266.28s)]
*  You bet. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=269.2s)]
*  I've spent my time in office trying to encourage younger people to get involved. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=270.2s)]
*  Senator Durbin, it's Ali Vitale. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=276.71999999999997s)]
*  I wonder if I can pick up on something you just said, this idea of are you competent? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=277.96s)]
*  Are you able to do this job in the Senate? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=281.88s)]
*  As you see this push from the grassroots that Lamir is talking about here, do you think [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=284.28s)]
*  enough of your colleagues are asking themselves those fundamental questions about if they [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=288.2s)]
*  can continue to serve? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=292.24s)]
*  I think so. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=294.44s)]
*  I think if you're honest about yourself and your reputation, you want to leave when you [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=295.44s)]
*  can still walk out the front door and not be carried out the back door. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=301.0s)]
*  I've said whatever your interests may be, whatever issue you want to focus on in Congress, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=305.03999999999996s)]
*  in the Senate if you stick around a couple terms, your minor is going to be aging. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=309.96s)]
*  You can see it, you can observe it. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=314.76s)]
*  And you have to make that choice, that decision. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=316.71999999999997s)]
*  I've made mine. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=319.47999999999996s)]
*  Senator, your early endorsement of Barack Obama in 2008 is seen as a pivotal moment, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=320.79999999999995s)]
*  not just for Barack Obama personally, but for the direction of the Democratic Party. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=329.32s)]
*  And it was prescient in many ways. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=333.68s)]
*  In this moment, what do you think the central question is for Democrats? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=335.96s)]
*  And as you prepare to leave, what is your advice to them about what the coalition should [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=340.08s)]
*  look like and who should lead it in the future? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=345.64s)]
*  This is a different moment in history than I've read about or seen in my lifetime for [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=349.0s)]
*  sure. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=353.8s)]
*  This is a moment where there's a threat to the Constitution of the United States and [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=354.88s)]
*  our constitutional democracy. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=358.6s)]
*  That is fundamental and it's in front of every other decision of policy that we might make. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=361.0s)]
*  We have to get it together. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=367.23999999999995s)]
*  I will plead with my Republican friends, stand up for the Constitution. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=368.56s)]
*  You took an oath and said you'd swear to defend this Constitution. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=372.96s)]
*  It needs defense now more than ever with the actions by President Trump. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=377.0s)]
*  In 100 days of this administration, the question is not whether Trump is sinking in the polling [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=381.12s)]
*  and he appears to be, but whether his fate is going to be shared by other Republicans [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=386.91999999999996s)]
*  and whether they have the courage to join Democrats and do the right things and stand [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=391.52s)]
*  up for the Constitution. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=396.15999999999997s)]
*  That to me, I think, just supersedes all conversations about campaigns and even issues. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=397.79999999999995s)]
*  Senator Durbin, looking over your bio, I realize that you are the reason that we no longer [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=403.64s)]
*  have cigarettes smoking on airplanes. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=408.32s)]
*  And I thank you for that. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=411.12s)]
*  That's one of many legislative achievements that you've had during your long tenure in [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=412.32s)]
*  public service. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=416.6s)]
*  I just wanted to ask you, what are you most proud of that you did or worked on during [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=417.6s)]
*  your time in Congress? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=424.24s)]
*  Well my dreamers, I introduced the DREAM Act over 20 years ago and 830,000 individuals [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=426.56s)]
*  have now proven that I was right. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=433.24s)]
*  They've made a dramatic contribution to this country because of the DACA program which [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=435.32000000000005s)]
*  Barack Obama initiated. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=439.58000000000004s)]
*  That is a source of pride. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=442.56s)]
*  But I have to tell you, taking smoking off of airplanes changed America. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=444.0s)]
*  It was a Malcolm Gladwell tipping point for sure. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=448.52s)]
*  And when you look back to where we were 20 plus years ago and where we are today, it's [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=451.36s)]
*  a lot safer environment and it's a lot healthier and it sure is a lot more fun to ride on an [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=456.56s)]
*  airplane. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZwWzwm2-c&t=462.36s)]
