# 'My son is not a gang member': Mother of vetted refugee sent to prison fears for son's safety
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI)
*  The Supreme Court on Friday stopped the Trump administration from deporting more migrants to a notorious [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI&t=0.0s)]
*  Salvadoran mega prison saying the government has to respect their due process rights [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI&t=7.88s)]
*  The final decision was 72 with justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas dissenting all [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI&t=13.52s)]
*  Three Trump appointed justices backed the ruling [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI&t=20.64s)]
*  But it only applies to people who haven't been sent to El Salvador yet [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI&t=24.44s)]
*  As for those who are already there new reporting shows some of them came to the US [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI&t=28.76s)]
*  Not only legally but through one of the most stringent stringent legal immigration programs available [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI&t=34.800000000000004s)]
*  NBC News correspondent David Nuriega spoke with the family of a migrant sent to that prison in El Salvador and says [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI&t=42.160000000000004s)]
*  That he's actually a vetted legal refugee David. What more are you learning? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI&t=49.44s)]
*  Yeah, good morning guys [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI&t=55.68s)]
*  So I've talked to many of the families and the lawyers of the Venezuelans who were deported to El Salvador [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI&t=56.879999999999995s)]
*  But a few of these cases really stand out because these are cases where the men who were deported had actually already gone through a rigorous [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI&t=61.54s)]
*  Process to prove to the US government that they didn't pose a threat to public safety. Take a look [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI&t=68.44s)]
*  Before they ever set foot in the United States [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI&t=76.32s)]
*  Lizbeth Sanguino and her sons went through months of vetting in-person interviews and background checks to be resettled as refugees from Venezuela [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI&t=79.32s)]
*  So she was shocked when the family arrived at the Houston Airport and immigration agents arrested her 24 year old son [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI&t=91.2s)]
*  Widmer Aguelbis the reason a tattoo of a rose and a clock which an agent wrote are [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI&t=98.28s)]
*  Associated with the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI&t=104.82000000000001s)]
*  but experts say Tren de Aragua does not use tattoos as markers of membership and [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI&t=107.38s)]
*  Government documents show that Aguelbis had no criminal record or other evidence linking him to the gang and [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI&t=112.66s)]
*  Yet he ended up here in a notorious [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI&t=119.14s)]
*  Supermax prison in El Salvador designed to lock up gang members and terrorists indefinitely with no contact with the outside world [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI&t=122.58s)]
*  He's one of hundreds of men deported to the prison without a court hearing under the alien enemies act as her convention of due process [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI&t=129.85999999999999s)]
*  That advocates have challenged in court as unlawful [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI&t=137.1s)]
*  But which Trump officials have justified by calling the men a threat to the nation [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI&t=139.78s)]
*  Our job is send the terrorists out before anyone else gets raped or murdered [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI&t=144.54s)]
*  We found through government documents and interviews with lawyers and families that at least three of the men including Aguelbis [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI&t=148.98s)]
*  Had been carefully vetted to come to the US under the refugee resettlement program a process for people fleeing war and persecution [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI&t=156.14000000000001s)]
*  My son Sanguino says is not a gang member or a terrorist [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI&t=166.46s)]
*  He's a soccer player and an aspiring engineer who looks after his younger brothers [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI&t=170.7s)]
*  His tattoos are references to his childhood his grandmother's rose garden and an owl that used to visit their home every night [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI&t=175.34s)]
*  The family's lawyers filed a habeas corpus petition in federal court alleging violations of due process [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI&t=182.3s)]
*  But for now I get this has effectively disappeared [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI&t=187.94s)]
*  For more than two months his mother has had no contact with him or received any information about his condition [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI&t=191.94s)]
*  You're como is into culpa. She feels guilty when she eats she says because she doesn't know if he's eating [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI&t=197.94s)]
*  How does this change your perception of the United States? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI&t=204.18s)]
*  Totally completely she says she thought the US was a place where things happened according to the law [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI&t=207.72s)]
*  We asked the Trump administration about this case and the others like it and they gave us a statement saying quote [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI&t=216.76s)]
*  We are confident in our law enforcement's intelligence and we aren't going to share intelligence [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI&t=222.95999999999998s)]
*  Reports and undermine national security every time a gang member denies. He is one that would be insane [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI&t=228.16s)]
*  End quote now meanwhile me we should be getting some news soon in the main lawsuit involving the men who were already deported to El [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI&t=234.84s)]
*  Salvador that's the ACLU's case before Judge Boasberg in DC and the big question there is this if [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI&t=242.07999999999998s)]
*  Trump is ordered to bring these men back men like the one you just heard about will he actually do so or will he defy the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI&t=247.64s)]
*  courts Joe [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI&t=254.0s)]
*  All right NBC News correspondent David Noriega. Thank you so much for that report [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837xBS2vshI&t=255.68s)]
