# ‘State of shock’: Steve Rattner’s charts show why Americans are pessimistic on economy
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU)
*  Morning Joe economic analyst Steve Ratner has made his way over to the southwest wall to break down the various [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=0.0s)]
*  Economic indicators that we are seeing including Steve how Americans are feeling about all this [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=6.44s)]
*  Yeah, I'm you got and the answer is Americans are not feeling good at all [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=12.72s)]
*  So let's take a look at a couple of the numbers that we do have [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=17.36s)]
*  So consumer sentiment obviously measures what consumers feel about the economy at a point in time [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  this gray line going to black here is [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=25.2s)]
*  All Americans put together and you can see how it's rolled over like that [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=28.12s)]
*  This is the fourth lowest reading in history since they started taking this survey [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=31.96s)]
*  it's an interesting thing that I've shown you before but [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=37.160000000000004s)]
*  People switch around based on who's president before the election the Democrats more optimistic now less and vice versa [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=40.28s)]
*  But even this Republican number which has gone up a little bit in Trump's first term [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=46.28s)]
*  confidence among [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  Republicans was up here. So even Republicans are still a long way from feeling as good about Donald Trump [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=52.86s)]
*  2.0 as they did about 1.0 [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=59.42s)]
*  No ambiguity about CEOs CEOs feel like this has just gone off a cliff [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=61.6s)]
*  This is the lowest reading since 2010 in the wake of the financial crisis [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=67.58s)]
*  CEOs and I've been around a lot of CEOs in the last few days and we talked about it a few minutes ago [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=72.5s)]
*  They hate the they hate the tariffs, but they hate the uncertainty even more [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=77.18s)]
*  They have no idea how to plan their business. They have no idea what's coming [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=81.54s)]
*  You're seeing CEOs at the moment releasing their first quarter earnings reports where they normally tell you the outlook for the year and company after company [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=84.66000000000001s)]
*  Is saying we can't tell you the outlook for the year because we don't know [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=91.7s)]
*  Steve I asked this sincerely are the CEOs you talked to are they genuinely surprised by what's happening here? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=95.9s)]
*  I mean, this is exactly what Donald Trump advertised during the campaign [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=102.80000000000001s)]
*  It's exactly what places like Goldman Sachs predicted that the economy would be much stronger if Joe Biden were reelected [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=106.42s)]
*  Excuse me of Kamala Harris were elected [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=112.7s)]
*  Are they actually surprised by what they're watching here? Yeah, Willie [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=115.26s)]
*  They are and I think they I think they thought that a campaign is a campaign people make lots of promises [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=119.02s)]
*  And then they come in office and do something more moderate something more like the right thing and so they're stunned [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=124.34s)]
*  They are really literally in a state of shock. They never expected this [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=130.22s)]
*  So let's look at your second chart Steve which gives us some of the reasons for the pessimism you just laid out and that's inflation [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=133.42s)]
*  That's cost of living that it's just gonna get a lot more difficult here this year to get through the day [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=139.78s)]
*  Yeah, so prices haven't actually started to go up much yet [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=145.77999999999997s)]
*  But it is coming because as these goods come in and the import taxes are put on them prices are gonna go up [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=149.01999999999998s)]
*  Consumers are terrified the market itself actually is not as quite as pessimistic about inflation [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=155.89999999999998s)]
*  But consumers really are scared six and a half percent up from under three percent [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=161.42s)]
*  Just a couple months ago the highest since 1981 and and so you see that then reflected in something [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=166.7s)]
*  You guys have been talking about but we'll lay it out here [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=173.5s)]
*  Which are the polls 39 percent approval rating for Trump lowest going all the way back to somewhere before Nixon [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=175.54s)]
*  Maybe LBJ at the height of the Vietnam War who knows but for a very very long time [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=182.18s)]
*  Lower than where Trump was last time at this point at first hundred days and actually lower than where Joe Biden was after [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=186.61999999999998s)]
*  his first hundred days [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=193.45999999999998s)]
*  You know Steve, I just want to go back you you said the CEO who is these captains of? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=195.54s)]
*  industry these these wizards of Wall Street are [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=202.57999999999998s)]
*  Stunned they are stunned that Donald Trump is doing what he said he was going to do since [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=207.38s)]
*  1987 that he's doing what we said he was going to do we kept warning about [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=214.34s)]
*  You know if you like certainty, this is not the way to go [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=220.98s)]
*  He's gonna really [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=224.57999999999998s)]
*  Really lean into the tariffs. He said tariffs is the most beautiful word in the English lane [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=227.14s)]
*  I just how could they have deluded themselves that he was going to come in and be? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=232.18s)]
*  Eisenhower he never was going to be Eisenhower [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=238.45999999999998s)]
*  He promised them [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=241.22s)]
*  Every day on the campaign trail that this is exactly what he was going to do [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=243.57999999999998s)]
*  So how can they sit back going? Oh my god? I can't believe he said he I can't believe he's doing what he said [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=248.54s)]
*  He was going to do since 1987 [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=253.85999999999999s)]
*  You know Joe's a great question. I think there's a combination of reasons and I'm not here to defend or explain it even but but [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=256.98s)]
*  I'll try to put myself in their head for you [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=263.71999999999997s)]
*  Trump 1.0 had some tariffs, but they were far more modest than this they caused much less chaos [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=265.88000000000005s)]
*  politicians say a lot of things on the campaign trail and [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=271.96000000000004s)]
*  Honestly, just what Trump did here has done here with the tariffs. It's just so far over the top [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=275.24s)]
*  It just never occurred to them. I shouldn't say never occurred [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=280.6s)]
*  They never believed that we can have 154 percent tariffs on things from China meaning effectively those toys will not be on the shelves at Christmas [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=283.56s)]
*  so Steve [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=292.32000000000005s)]
*  Moving forward president Trump said that Biden is also responsible for the future [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=294.16s)]
*  What is the economic outlook under? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=300.88000000000005s)]
*  Trump's second presidency [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=303.8s)]
*  Yeah [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=305.44s)]
*  He said Biden was responsible for what's happened in the stock market and more of it would be responsible for anything else that happens in the stock [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=305.8s)]
*  Market. Yeah, so let's talk about what happened in the stock market in Trump 2.0. The stock market is down 7% [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=312.08000000000004s)]
*  That is the worst performance of a stock market in the first hundred days of a presidential term since Nixon's second term in [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=319.08s)]
*  1973 it is in stark contrast to Trump's first term when contrary to what many people expected the stock market actually went up 5% [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=327.12s)]
*  And back to Joe's question because he didn't come out and do all this crazy stuff [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=335.64s)]
*  But also what but what is really troublesome for every American whether you have an IRA or you're an investor is the volatility [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=340.12s)]
*  Look at what the stock market did in the course of these hundred days and look compared to any of these other periods [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=347.12s)]
*  This is this is this is another form of uncertainty, which is unbelievably destabilizing to business [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=352.84000000000003s)]
*  So where does that put us all together puts us all together with recession odds going up very very sharply [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=358.5s)]
*  We don't yet obviously have data yet on what's happened really in the last little bit [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=364.74s)]
*  But let's just go back and take a look [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=369.62s)]
*  There were some fears of recession back in 24 when the Fed was raising interest rates when Joe Biden left office you guys have [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=371.44s)]
*  Talked over and over again. How about when Joe Biden left office? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=377.88s)]
*  economy is growing two and a half percent low unemployment [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=381.0s)]
*  Inflation on its way down and so recession odds close to zero Trump comes in recession odds go up up up up up [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=384.23999999999995s)]
*  45 to 40 percent Goldman Sachs versus Bloomberg and then just as a fun fact on April 9th [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=392.12s)]
*  Goldman Sachs raised its recession probability to 65 percent [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=398.98s)]
*  Because of the tariffs two hours later Trump rescinded some of the tariffs or delayed them and they took that forecast back down to 45 [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=403.14000000000004s)]
*  Percent and this is another example of the volatility and the uncertainty that business hates and just makes their job [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=410.64000000000004s)]
*  unbelievably difficult [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=418.3s)]
*  Before we look before we let you go Steve really quickly. I just want to ask you about [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=420.98s)]
*  You referenced it this report is a little quirky just as a caveat a little quirky because [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=424.96s)]
*  Imports flooded in people were trying to beat the tariffs that sort of skewed some of the GDP numbers [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=432.47999999999996s)]
*  There's no doubt that the next two three months are looking pretty rocky [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=439.44s)]
*  But but you had mentioned it talk about why this reading was a little bit quirky [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=443.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, Joe. It was quirky for a couple of reasons and it's worth pointing out first of all Trump wasn't even president [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=448.44s)]
*  For the whole 90 days secondly it ended on March 31st and the tariffs came in on April 2nd [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=453.36s)]
*  But as you said the key things were that imports came into the country in anticipation the tariffs [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=458.68s)]
*  That lowers the GDP, but you also had a bunch of businesses out there [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=465.2s)]
*  Trying to make some investments and buy some capital goods before the tariffs that makes it higher when you strip it all apart [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=469.32s)]
*  It does appear that the economy grew by a couple percent in the first quarter [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=475.52000000000004s)]
*  In the first quarter, but that is that I would put on Biden when Biden was the president for a month of that [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=480.08s)]
*  Plus it was his economy that Trump inherited so I give Biden credit for what was actually not a bad GDP number [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=486.88s)]
*  We got to look at there was a jobs number yesterday from ADP [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=493.38s)]
*  We're gonna get another jobs number this Friday [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=496.24s)]
*  But the ADP number that came out yesterday showed roughly half as many jobs being created last month as the month before [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=498.32s)]
*  So you may start to see some effects of Trump but but I [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=504.88s)]
*  But looking ahead it's all bad. There's nothing but gloom out there in the business and the investor community [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=509.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I mean that's why that's why again that we've said it here the next 100 days [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=516.28s)]
*  We were telling even in the first 100 days as far as the economy goes again [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=522.36s)]
*  There are a couple of different a couple caveats to add to this number [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=527.48s)]
*  But you look at consumer confidence plummeting you look at savings rates [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=531.38s)]
*  Down a lot of reasons to be deeply concerned for [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=536.02s)]
*  Americans as we move forward over the next three months warning Joe economic analyst Steve Ratner. Thank you so much caddy [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=540.98s)]
*  You [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvln4KV02XU&t=561.1s)]
