*  So before his Michigan rally last night something very interesting president Trump stopped at Selfridge Air National Guard Base to announce a new mission and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXfD4fQY1zI&t=0.0s)]
*  jobs [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXfD4fQY1zI&t=8.68s)]

*  This comes just weeks after Whitmer and Trump met at the White House as the governor attempted to secure the new mission [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXfD4fQY1zI&t=15.0s)]
*  For the airbase that meeting and the photo of Whitmer in the Oval Office led to some within the Democratic Party [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXfD4fQY1zI&t=22.04s)]
*  To criticize the governor's actions ahead of the airbase event a spokesperson for the governor said [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXfD4fQY1zI&t=28.7s)]
*  Whitmer planned to be at the airbase to quote support her troops and the long-standing effort [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXfD4fQY1zI&t=35.5s)]
*  She made to secure support for Selfridge at the event Trump offered rare praise for the Michigan governor [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXfD4fQY1zI&t=41.66s)]
*  Crediting her for the new jobs that would be coming to the airbase [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXfD4fQY1zI&t=50.46s)]
*  He then called for Whitmer to speak at the podium [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXfD4fQY1zI&t=54.06s)]
*  Well, I hadn't planned to speak but I'm on behalf of all the military men and women who serve our country and [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXfD4fQY1zI&t=58.900000000000006s)]

*  We're here to celebrate this recapitalization at Selfridge. It's crucial for the Michigan economy [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXfD4fQY1zI&t=70.78s)]
*  It's crucial for the men and women here for our homeland security and our future. So thank you [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXfD4fQY1zI&t=75.94s)]

*  Thank you [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXfD4fQY1zI&t=86.86s)]
*  Well done got to work with the president you got and she she accomplished that she should speak to it [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXfD4fQY1zI&t=91.18s)]
*  So she was asked about all of this at by a local affiliate. Take a listen to what she said [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXfD4fQY1zI&t=96.86s)]
*  We have a lot of differences and there's a lot of [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXfD4fQY1zI&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  decisions that the administrations made that I'm opposed to and I'll continue to [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXfD4fQY1zI&t=108.7s)]
*  Be you know on the opposite side and and fight when I have to but so long as we can put the people of Michigan [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXfD4fQY1zI&t=112.92s)]
*  First, I think we can find some additional common ground like we did today at Selfridge [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXfD4fQY1zI&t=119.66s)]
*  How would you describe yours in the president's relationship? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXfD4fQY1zI&t=123.92s)]
*  Evolving, you know where I think it was, you know, we were obviously very contentious last term [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXfD4fQY1zI&t=129.08s)]
*  There are a lot of things that the president's doing that I disagree with right now [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXfD4fQY1zI&t=134.72s)]
*  But I am always gonna first seek collaboration, but I won't back down from a fight either Jen Paul Mary [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXfD4fQY1zI&t=138.72s)]
*  is is [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXfD4fQY1zI&t=145.88s)]

*  behalf of the people of her state [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXfD4fQY1zI&t=152.67999999999998s)]
*  Where where you know, what's the talk because I have to say the the criticism of this [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXfD4fQY1zI&t=155.64s)]
*  the White House event [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXfD4fQY1zI&t=162.16s)]
*  It seems a little [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXfD4fQY1zI&t=164.11999999999998s)]
*  Misdirected because she's doing her job and she's also using her voice saying I vehemently disagree with most of what he's doing [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXfD4fQY1zI&t=166.52s)]
*  Yeah, she she is not getting criticized in Michigan [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXfD4fQY1zI&t=175.68s)]
*  I was you know, she is she's very popular here and I think you know, I have seen some [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXfD4fQY1zI&t=178.4s)]
*  I've happened to see some focus groups not just with Democrats with independents mega voters that [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXfD4fQY1zI&t=183.84s)]
*  Appreciate the work that she's doing that, you know, one guy said, you know, she's just for Michiganders [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXfD4fQY1zI&t=189.36s)]
*  it doesn't matter what party you are and [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXfD4fQY1zI&t=193.12s)]
*  You know, she had she's in a this is a you know, this is a interesting strategy. There are risks with it [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXfD4fQY1zI&t=195.68s)]
*  She's got two years left Trump wins her state [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXfD4fQY1zI&t=202.4s)]
*  Republicans win one chamber of her legislature and so she could have decided [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXfD4fQY1zI&t=206.0s)]
*  I'm gonna put forward a really progressive agenda and just fight with Trump and [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXfD4fQY1zI&t=209.88s)]
*  Fight with Republicans in my state and that could be her two years and maybe she runs for president in 2028 and she runs on that [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXfD4fQY1zI&t=215.20000000000002s)]
*  But she decided that she had an obligation to do what she can do to get stuff done for Michigan [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXfD4fQY1zI&t=221.52s)]
*  You know try to steer the administration to not hurt but to help the state and I think people should remember that and [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXfD4fQY1zI&t=226.56s)]
*  Michigan is still you know, Michigan went through the Great Recession [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXfD4fQY1zI&t=233.32s)]
*  It hit everybody harder than it hit Michigan harder than any other state Democrats still have a lot to prove here [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXfD4fQY1zI&t=235.68s)]
*  And you know if you're if she does eventually run for president [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXfD4fQY1zI&t=241.48000000000002s)]

*  That has its own merits and then there'll be a lane of people like her that can say my focus has always been on [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXfD4fQY1zI&t=249.48000000000002s)]
