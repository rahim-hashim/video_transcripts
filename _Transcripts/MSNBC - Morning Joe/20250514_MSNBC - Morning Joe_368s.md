# 'Largest Medicaid cut in history': Leader Jeffires calls out Republicans over 'tax scam'
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU)
*  This morning, the House Energy and Commerce Committee continues its marathon session on [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=0.0s)]
*  proposed Medicaid cuts that will be included in the Republican Party's sweeping domestic [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=5.44s)]
*  policy bill. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=11.56s)]
*  Let's bring in House Minority Leader, Democratic Congressman Hakeem Jeffries of New York. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=12.92s)]
*  It's good to have you on, sir. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=18.8s)]
*  Tell us about those cuts. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=20.88s)]
*  How will Americans be feeling them? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=22.12s)]
*  Well, good morning. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=24.28s)]
*  House Democrats are working hard through the night, both on the Energy and Commerce Committee [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=26.24s)]
*  and the Ways and Means Committee, to push back against this GOP tax scam, where they [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=30.599999999999998s)]
*  are trying to enact the largest Medicaid cut in American history. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=35.56s)]
*  North of $700 billion, independent observers have confirmed that if the Republicans are [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=41.4s)]
*  successful in passing this GOP tax scam, then approximately 14 million people will [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=49.46s)]
*  actually lose their health coverage. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=56.38s)]
*  Hospitals will close. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=58.82s)]
*  Nursing homes will shut down. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=60.260000000000005s)]
*  This really is a matter of life and death, and it's all being done to try to enact massive [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=62.06s)]
*  tax cuts for MAGA billionaire donors like Elon Musk. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=68.02s)]
*  It's shameful. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=71.82s)]
*  Leader Jeffries, I'm also looking deep into this bill at proposed cuts to SNAP. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=72.82s)]
*  This food assistance for people across the country, red states, blue states, white, black, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=77.66s)]
*  Latino, you name it, $300 billion cuts proposed. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=82.86s)]
*  What would be the impact of that? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=87.34s)]
*  Republicans are literally ripping food out of the mouths of children and seniors and [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=90.46s)]
*  veterans. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=96.46s)]
*  About 20% of the households that have veterans living in them right now rely upon SNAP. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=97.46s)]
*  And in addition to trying to jam this massive cut to health care down the throat of the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=103.66s)]
*  American people, this would be the largest cut to nutritional assistance in the history [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=110.1s)]
*  of the United States of America. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=115.12s)]
*  And so Republicans are really pushing an extreme agenda at this point in time, directed by [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=117.1s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=123.38s)]
*  And unfortunately, what we've seen is that Republicans in the Congress continue to simply [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=124.38s)]
*  as opposed to standing up for the best interests of their constituents. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=129.06s)]
*  Leader Jeffries, there's so much going on around the country and so much news coming [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=133.18s)]
*  out of this administration that perhaps this bill is not getting the attention you may [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=136.82s)]
*  feel it deserves. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=141.62s)]
*  I know there were protesters and some people were arrested up on Capitol Hill this week. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=142.62s)]
*  How can you make Democrats and Republicans who could lose in red states and rural areas [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=147.38s)]
*  as well from this bill? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=154.26s)]
*  How can you make them more aware and get their voices heard so that changes could be made [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=155.5s)]
*  the bill? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=160.62s)]
*  Well, these cuts are deeply unpopular across the country. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=161.62s)]
*  And we're seeing that in district after district after district. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=164.54s)]
*  One of the reasons why Republican House leaders have told their members to stop holding town [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=167.98s)]
*  hall meetings is because the American people in blue states and swing states and red states [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=172.54s)]
*  have been showing up protesting these proposed cuts to their health care, these proposed [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=177.34s)]
*  to their nutritional assistance, the efforts to hurt veterans. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=182.56s)]
*  And so we just have to keep the pressure on. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=185.72s)]
*  We're in a more is more environment. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=188.4s)]
*  We're doing town hall meetings in our districts and town hall meetings in Republican districts, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=190.8s)]
*  rallies and speeches and demonstrations and sit ins. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=195.88000000000002s)]
*  We'll continue to elevate for the American people the stakes of this battle. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=200.0s)]
*  And all we need is to find four Republicans who are willing to do the right thing. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=205.32000000000002s)]
*  And we can stop this extreme budget from being enacted. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=209.62s)]
*  Let me circle back to an issue that we were talking about more a month ago. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=212.58s)]
*  And I'm just curious what Congress is doing, what Congress can do, what Democrats can do [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=217.70000000000002s)]
*  about USAID. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=222.42000000000002s)]
*  We have a situation where you have the richest billionaire in the world slashing funding [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=223.86s)]
*  that's going to ultimately take food out of the mouths of the poorest children on the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=231.02s)]
*  planet. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=236.58s)]
*  Now, USAID, obviously, it was a congressionally mandated agency. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=237.62s)]
*  You all authorized the spending. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=243.78s)]
*  You appropriated the spending. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=246.58s)]
*  And I'm just curious, when does Congress circle back? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=248.74s)]
*  Because I know there are a lot of Republicans on the Hill that don't want PEPFAR cut. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=251.82000000000002s)]
*  This Bush program that was inspired by his faith, his evangelical faith, saved over 25 [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=256.98s)]
*  million lives in Africa. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=263.3s)]
*  We could talk about Catholic charities, Baptist charities, a lot of cuts, both secular and [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=264.54s)]
*  religious charities helping the poorest across the world. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=271.42s)]
*  What can Congress do to make sure that funding starts back up? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=277.22s)]
*  Well, Joe, as you know, the Constitution gives Congress generally, and the House specifically, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=282.1s)]
*  the power of the purse. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=288.22s)]
*  And as the appropriations process begins at the conclusion of this Republican budget reconciliation [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=290.14000000000004s)]
*  effort, we're going to have to strongly push our Republican colleagues to join us to make [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=296.06s)]
*  sure that congressionally mandated funding, including as it relates to USAID, which helps [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=302.74s)]
*  the best interests of the United States of America, it's the right thing to do. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=310.46000000000004s)]
*  It's a moral outrage that these funds have been cut. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=314.90000000000003s)]
*  But it's also a strategic outrage because what the Trump administration and Elon Musk [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=318.18s)]
*  are doing are undermining the soft power of the United States of America. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=322.65999999999997s)]
*  And if we don't step in to battle these humanitarian situations that are happening across the world, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=327.53999999999996s)]
*  China will step in. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=334.7s)]
*  And that's bad for the national security of the United States of America. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=336.34s)]
*  House Minority Leader Democratic Congressman Hakeem Jeffries of New York, thank you very [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=339.65999999999997s)]
*  much for coming on the show this morning. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=344.74s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=346.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3wgnuftjfU&t=348.14s)]
