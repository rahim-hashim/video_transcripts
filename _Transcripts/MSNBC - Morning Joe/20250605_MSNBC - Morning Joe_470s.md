# 'We've got to do more to stop it': House member on 'scourge of antisemitism'
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI)
*  Back here in the States, a federal judge has issued an order preventing the deportation, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=0.0s)]
*  for now, of the wife and five children of an Egyptian man charged in that firebombing [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=5.68s)]
*  attack in Colorado. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=11.52s)]
*  The failing members of Mohammed Salman, all Egyptian citizens, were taken into federal [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=14.46s)]
*  custody on Tuesday by U.S. immigration officials. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  They have not been charged in connection to Sunday's attack there in Boulder. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=23.36s)]
*  The 45-year-old Salman faces federal hate crime charges and state charges of attempted [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=28.06s)]
*  murder after authorities say he threw Molotov cocktails at a group of people who gathered [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=32.86s)]
*  to bring attention to the Israeli hostages still being held in Gaza. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=38.66s)]
*  Several people were injured, some severely. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=43.7s)]
*  Joining us now, Assistant Democratic Leader Congressman Joe Neguse of Colorado. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=47.739999999999995s)]
*  He represents the city of Boulder. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=51.68s)]
*  Congressman, thank you for joining us this morning. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=53.9s)]
*  First, if you can provide us any updates as to the conditions of those who were injured [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=56.800000000000004s)]
*  that day and just talk to us about, if you will, the trauma and pain the city of Boulder [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=62.58s)]
*  is going through. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=68.22s)]
*  Well, thank you for having me on. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=69.22s)]
*  We now know that there were 15 victims, members of our community, who were victims of this [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=73.0s)]
*  heinous and horrific terror attack which was targeted at the Jewish people in our community, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=78.32s)]
*  as you know and as your viewers well know now. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=83.78s)]
*  For every week for the last two years, members of my community, Jewish members of the community [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=87.36s)]
*  have gathered to hold a peaceful vigil, a peaceful march, to call for the release of [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=92.68s)]
*  the hostages that were kidnapped and are being held by Hamas in Gaza. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=97.64s)]
*  And those citizens were subjected to a horrific act of terror when the defendant, the perpetrator [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=102.92s)]
*  that you referenced, literally tried to burn them alive with Molotov cocktails and an incendiary [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=109.64s)]
*  device. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=115.92s)]
*  And our community is reeling. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=116.92s)]
*  This type of hateful violence and anti-Semitism is metastasizing across our country, in my [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=119.36s)]
*  view, and we've got to do more to stop it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  So we are focused squarely, of course, on helping the victims as they heal on their [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=128.8s)]
*  road to recovery, several of the victims I know personally, but also redoubling our efforts [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=133.76s)]
*  to end the scourge of anti-Semitism, which, as I said, has just become incredibly prevalent [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=139.44s)]
*  across our country and I think warrants the attention of lawmakers here in Washington, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=144.48000000000002s)]
*  D.C. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=149.28s)]
*  Congressman, in your estimation, what should be the proper course of action for the suspect's [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=150.28s)]
*  family? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=155.0s)]
*  It's just noted a judge has blocked efforts, at least so far, to deport them. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=156.0s)]
*  The White House has really been pushing that option. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=159.56s)]
*  What do you think should happen? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=163.16s)]
*  I'd say this. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=164.16s)]
*  I haven't reviewed the federal judge's order in that particular instance. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=165.88s)]
*  As you know, the defendant will be arraigned later today in Boulder County Court by our [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  local district attorney on dozens of charges, including attempted murder. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=174.79999999999998s)]
*  We're in close touch with the district attorney as well as with the FBI locally, and I trust [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=179.28s)]
*  local law enforcement to be able to bring the perpetrator to justice and to do what [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=184.51999999999998s)]
*  needs to be done to keep our community safe. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=188.6s)]
*  Beyond that, I think it would be premature and inappropriate for me to opine on that [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=190.84s)]
*  particular case that you've referenced, particularly given that we're going to learn more, I suspect, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=194.76s)]
*  later today and in the days ahead as the criminal case with respect to the defendant proceeds. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=200.23999999999998s)]
*  Congressman, the president of the National Action Network and host at MSNBC's Politics [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=205.6s)]
*  Nation, the Reverend Al Sharpton, joins us now. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=210.04s)]
*  And, Rev, you've got the next question. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=213.0s)]
*  Congressman, let me raise this question. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=215.12s)]
*  As we deal with the rise of hate crimes, antisemitism, racism and all, we struggle with the fact [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=217.51999999999998s)]
*  that you have to be against any hate crime, any violence, or you can't really be against [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=226.16s)]
*  when it comes to your group, which is why many of us in the black community stood with [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=234.32s)]
*  the Jewish leaders when there was the attack, the killing of the two just a couple of weeks [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=240.07999999999998s)]
*  ago there in Washington. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=244.72s)]
*  Talk about how the issue of trying to resolve a two-state solution or some kind of piece [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=247.16000000000003s)]
*  and dealing with the fact that the kidnap should not be kidnapped and people shouldn't [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=255.32000000000002s)]
*  be starving in Gaza, how that balance is disturbed when you have someone like this that takes [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=260.0s)]
*  violence because then it polarizes and causes something that is not going to even help the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=265.44s)]
*  cause that they claim to believe in. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=273.04s)]
*  Yeah, I would say this and it's good to see you, Rev. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=275.67999999999995s)]
*  I think that there is a risk in moments like this of over-complicating the analysis that's [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=278.67999999999995s)]
*  required by citizens and by lawmakers alike. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=286.59999999999997s)]
*  To me, it's very simple. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=289.91999999999996s)]
*  This is about the safety of my constituents, of Jewish brothers and sisters whom I represent [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=291.35999999999996s)]
*  and whom I serve in my district in Colorado, who right now are living in fear because members [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=297.91999999999996s)]
*  of their community were just firebombed 72 hours ago. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=304.48s)]
*  And from my perspective, the focus has got to be on finding ways to keep them safe given [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=308.71999999999997s)]
*  that we know that what happened on Sunday, this terrorist attack, wasn't in isolation. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=314.32s)]
*  It followed, just as you mentioned, the murder of two Jewish community members here in Washington, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=319.2s)]
*  D.C., in our nation's capital, staffed at the Israeli embassy. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=325.12s)]
*  So I don't think the Congress has done enough to be candid and frank. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=329.28s)]
*  I think we have to do more. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=333.08000000000004s)]
*  And the Boulder community is a resilient community. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=334.32s)]
*  Make no mistake, we will care for our neighbors, we'll stand for the community, we'll condemn [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=337.20000000000005s)]
*  all types of hate and hateful rhetoric. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=341.40000000000003s)]
*  But in this instance, again, I would just I would lean in on this particular point that [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=344.28000000000003s)]
*  I think we have to do more regarding anti-Semitism, which to me continues to metastasize. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=349.64000000000004s)]
*  Congressman, another thing that you're helping lead is the end corruption now agenda introduced [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=356.56s)]
*  yesterday by several House Democrats. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=362.68s)]
*  Tell us what it is and what you're hoping to accomplish. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=365.88s)]
*  Well, thanks for asking that question, because so, as you well know, and you've covered extensively [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=370.08s)]
*  on your program, President Trump has really made corruption ubiquitous here in Washington, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=374.44s)]
*  D.C., tragically. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=379.4s)]
*  He promised to drain the swamp. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=380.48s)]
*  He's done anything but. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=382.04s)]
*  And so yesterday, a group of next generation reformers in the House, folks that you've [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=383.36s)]
*  had on your program, Pat Ryan, Angie Craig, Hillary Skollden and others joined together [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=388.76s)]
*  to ring the alarm regarding the corruption that has become normalized here in Washington, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=394.08s)]
*  D.C., and to propose some simple legislative tools to try to stop it. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=399.08s)]
*  These are not controversial proposals. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=403.56s)]
*  They're proposals to ban stock trading by members of Congress, to impose a lifetime [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=405.59999999999997s)]
*  lobbying ban by members of Congress, to strengthen corruption and recusal rules in the executive [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=409.8s)]
*  branch so that the type of corruption that has been so brazen over the course of the [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=415.84000000000003s)]
*  last 130 some odd days comes to an end. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=420.2s)]
*  So we're committed to working with anybody in good faith to try to get these bills across [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=423.56s)]
*  the finish line. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=427.88s)]
*  They are deeply popular with the American public, even if they may not be popular here [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=428.88s)]
*  in the halls of Congress. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=433.36s)]
*  But hope springs eternal that we can get some of these proposals across the finish line. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=434.76s)]
*  And Democratic leader, Congressman Joe Noguiz of Colorado, thank you very much for coming [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=440.44s)]
*  on the show this morning. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=446.8s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RwV1IMxMBI&t=448.76s)]
