# Kennedy and vaccines loom over Senate confirmation hearing for CDC director
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM)
*  Secretary Kennedy is giving a platform to people who lie about vaccines to the American [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=0.0s)]
*  people. When Kennedy appeared before this committee, I said I did not want any more [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=5.84s)]
*  tiny coffins in our country. I meant it. And I hope you will be forceful in pushing back [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=10.4s)]
*  against Secretary Kennedy's wrong assessment and messaging on vaccines. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=16.62s)]
*  Do you agree with Secretary Kennedy's decision to fire all 17 ACIP members on the basis of [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=23.2s)]
*  conflicts of interest? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=29.88s)]
*  So look, the American restoring trust in public health is a critical priority. For me, it's [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=31.96s)]
*  a critical- [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=39.2s)]
*  Doctor, I would really just love an answer. Do you agree with that? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=40.2s)]
*  I agree that the Secretary had to make a decision- [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=43.8s)]
*  Hmm. Democratic senators there pressing CDC Director nominee Susan Menares on her views [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  and human services director Robert F. Kennedy Jr. during her confirmation hearing yesterday. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=56.0s)]
*  Menares appeared before the Senate Help Committee where she was peppered with questions on everything [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=61.040000000000006s)]
*  from rural health care to overdose deaths. The hearing though took a turn when Democrats [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=67.26s)]
*  questioned her about Secretary Kennedy's decisions on vaccines. The overhauled CDC vaccine advisory [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=72.56s)]
*  panel mentioned by the senators there held its first meeting at the same time as the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=79.60000000000001s)]
*  hearing and just weeks after Secretary Kennedy fired the entire 17-member panel. Kennedy [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=84.32s)]
*  replaced them with appointees of his own choosing, some who have expressed vaccine skepticism. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=90.72s)]
*  In the meeting, the members announced they plan to review the childhood vaccination schedule, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=96.19999999999999s)]
*  the standard that has been approved for decades. The panel added they could also consider revising [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=101.63999999999999s)]
*  long-standing vaccine recommendations. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=107.85999999999999s)]
*  So joining us now, NBC News medical contributor, Dr. Vin Gupta, also with us, Dr. Fiona Havers. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=113.08s)]
*  She recently resigned from the CDC over HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s vaccine [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=120.0s)]
*  policies. Dr. Havers, start by telling us what you expect from this new panel. You resigned [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=125.92s)]
*  from the CDC, but when you look at the new panel, what do you think of the makeup of [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=134.5s)]
*  it? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=137.6s)]
*  I would say the makeup of the panel is very different than the 17 members that were fired. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=139.12s)]
*  Those 17 members were highly respected vaccine experts. And I watched the meeting all day [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=144.76s)]
*  yesterday and I would say the quality of the questions, the tone of the questions from [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=150.04s)]
*  almost all of the members on the new committee were not the same type of questions that the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=155.88s)]
*  previous ACIP members would have asked. They generally speaking, not going to name names, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=160.4s)]
*  the people that are currently on ACIP by and large are not the people that should be sitting [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=168.28s)]
*  on that panel. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=173.76s)]
*  Dr. Gupta, let's go to you on this. Set the stage for our audience, please. Just how important [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=174.76s)]
*  is this panel and what are your concerns about how you see it now? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=180.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, you know, Jonathan, building on Dr. Havers' point, this panel can be consequential, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=186.6s)]
*  has been very consequential in the past. You know, us as clinicians across the country [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=192.64s)]
*  look for the recommendations to then recommend what our patients should be doing when we're [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=196.60000000000002s)]
*  visiting with them in clinics across the country. This notion of, you know, they've moved towards [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=202.24s)]
*  quote unquote shared decision making that we should be having conversations in a lot [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  of cases on whether a family should or should not be getting vaccinated when previously [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=211.96s)]
*  was very clear what families should be doing to get vaccinated in a lot of these vaccines. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=216.52s)]
*  You know, when I hear from clinicians, my peers across the country, they say, you know, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=220.44s)]
*  we don't have enough time in a quick 15 minute visit to engage in these types of conversations [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=224.52s)]
*  when previously was pretty crystal clear. I'll say just in the last 24 hours, Jonathan, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=229.28s)]
*  there's been a lot of movement across civil society. The American Medical Association [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=235.28s)]
*  with 78 medical societies came together and vociferously backed existing guidelines for [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=240.08s)]
*  seasonal vaccines against COVID, RSV flu. American health insurance plans, AHIP for short, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=249.4s)]
*  said that their member health insurance plans are going to continue reimbursements and coverage [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=254.68s)]
*  for vaccines. So it's important to recognize that there's movement around what's happening with ACIP. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=260.2s)]
*  Yeah. And Richard, I mean, it can't be overstated. Some of the worries about the change in the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=267.24s)]
*  vaccination approach from this government. We know Senator Cassidy from Louisiana, a doctor, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=271.32s)]
*  said he got assurances from Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that he wouldn't change anything. Well, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=278.28s)]
*  turned out that wasn't the case. Exactly what I really, Jonathan, what I want to ask Dr. Havers, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=281.88s)]
*  what is the bottom line here? What are we talking about in terms of the consequences, either in [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=286.12s)]
*  terms of if the existing guidelines are somehow changed, modified, whatever the word is, weakened, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=289.96s)]
*  and also in terms of new vaccines in the pipeline? What are the consequences of what is going on in [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=295.8s)]
*  Washington? What's your answer to the why should we care? What's the so what answer to this? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=301.56s)]
*  So not only is the CDC immunization schedule critical for providers and to know what vaccines [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=307.88s)]
*  to give, but insurance company insurance coverage depends on it. By law, if it's on the CDC [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=313.71999999999997s)]
*  immunization schedule, insurance companies have to cover it. So in addition, the ACIP, this advisory [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=319.64s)]
*  committee is the one that recommends what vaccines are covered by the Vaccine for Children's Program, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=326.28s)]
*  which provides free vaccines to millions of children. So if RFK Jr. continues to interfere [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=331.88s)]
*  with this process, and people who have anti vaccine views are the ones making recommendations, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=337.08s)]
*  and they recommend to restrict and change the CDC schedule so that certain vaccines are no [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=342.03999999999996s)]
*  longer recommended, insurance won't cover it. So if you're a parent and they vote to remove certain [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=347.4s)]
*  childhood vaccines that are safe and effective, you could end up in a situation in a year where [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=353.4s)]
*  you take your toddler to the pediatrician, they want to give you a vaccine, but your insurance [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=357.88s)]
*  will no longer pay for it, or you won't be able to receive it free like you would now. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=363.88s)]
*  And the direct consequences of that is that more people are going to die. Vaccine preventable [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=367.8s)]
*  diseases are increasing in the United States since HHS Secretary RFK Jr. has been in his position. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=372.52s)]
*  We've seen two children die from measles, which was eliminated in this country. I think we will [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=379.88s)]
*  potentially see if they restrict access to vaccines, we're going to see more vaccine preventable deaths. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=385.0s)]
*  Let's just simply underscore that point right now, what you just said, more people are going to die. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=390.44s)]
*  Dr. Fiona Havers, thank you so much. We really appreciate you being here this morning. Dr. Gupta, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=399.8s)]
*  that's obviously those words echo in the air and really concerning. We also want to turn you now [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=405.24s)]
*  in our closing moments about another serious matter, which is extreme heat, which we of course [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=411.24s)]
*  see more and more here in the U.S. and around the world thanks to climate change. Give us your [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=416.68s)]
*  concerns. We're just coming out of this dangerous heat wave here in the East Coast, but I'm sure [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=421.8s)]
*  there will be more. What are your worries? How can people take care of themselves? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=425.72s)]
*  Well Dr. I know we don't have a lot of time here, so just quick tips here for your viewers, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=431.56s)]
*  reminders here. Wear a hat. Even if you have a full head of hair, wear a hat. It's going to [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=436.36s)]
*  protect against unnecessary sun exposure. Put on sunscreen. Look for broad spectrum on the label. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=441.24s)]
*  It protects against all forms of ultraviolet light. SPF 30 minimum. Use the lotion form. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=448.28000000000003s)]
*  And hydrate. Skin milk is the most hydrating fluid you can actually drink, more so than even water. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=454.44s)]
*  Skin milk, if you can do it. And then check on your elderly neighbors, anybody that may be a [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=459.0s)]
*  child in your home or around you. Fatigue, just weak acting, altered are the early signs of heat [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=465.0s)]
*  exhaustion. NBC News, medical contributor Dr. Van Gupta, thank you for those wise words. We [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=471.8s)]
*  appreciate it and we'll talk to you again soon. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhnkcTJrjM&t=478.04s)]
