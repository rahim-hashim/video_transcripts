# 'Here is our report': David Rohde pushes back on Hegseth's claim about press coverage
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY)
*  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, as well as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=0.0s)]
*  General Kaine, walking us through the mission to attack these Iranian sites over the weekend [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=4.16s)]
*  and then defend a military base in the region from Iran's retaliation a couple of days later. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  A few notes here off the top. That was obviously a rather impassioned speech from the defense [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  secretary attacking the media in many ways for its coverage of what has happened in Iran. It will be [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=24.72s)]
*  clear he suggests the media was trying to demean the contributions of the pilots and the other [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=31.28s)]
*  military personnel behind their operation. That's simply not the case. We of course are grateful [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=35.84s)]
*  for their service and applaud their heroism. And then we had a very lengthy story from General Kaine [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=39.84s)]
*  about indeed the incidents there to defend the base and as well as the strikes a few days prior. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=46.24s)]
*  David Road, who's still with me and I'm grateful to you for being here, we didn't get a lot new [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=52.24s)]
*  in the way of actually the effectiveness of the strikes. At the end, the defense secretary was [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=58.32s)]
*  pressed a little bit about reports that Iran may have been able to move some of the enriched [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=62.96s)]
*  uranium. There's satellite photos that show that trucks may have left the site prior to the attack. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=67.44s)]
*  He said he simply wasn't aware of that. What struck out to you from what we just heard over [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=72.72s)]
*  the last nearly an hour? The failure to answer that question because what we need to do is [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=77.68s)]
*  look forward. And so the simple question was that is there any evidence that the U.S. knows of that [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=81.84s)]
*  the enriched uranium, the critical ingredient to make a nuclear bomb, was removed from the site [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=87.36s)]
*  before it was bombed? He didn't answer that question. And as you said, he spent most of the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=92.72s)]
*  presentation attacking the media. General Kaine, I thought, was much more restrained. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=99.36s)]
*  But this is the real question, as we talked about earlier. Will Iran now try to covertly build a [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=103.2s)]
*  nuclear bomb? So if that enriched uranium has been moved, if there are other sites where there are [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=109.12s)]
*  centrifuges, again, Iran can be like North Korea, Israel, Pakistan, and India. Many countries have [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=113.04s)]
*  done this. And that's what we, I think, we as journalists should be writing about and members [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  of Congress should be debating. And that's really the issue here. Yeah. And then we won't spend too [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  much time on the baseless attacks on the press going after some of the better Pentagon reporters [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=130.56s)]
*  there, even by name. We should also mention that at one point the defense secretary suggested this [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=135.76s)]
*  was the, I'm paraphrasing, but only a little, the most secret and complex military operation [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=141.28s)]
*  in history. I think the folks at Author D-Day might have something to say about that. But again, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=147.2s)]
*  it seems like at least some damage, maybe even some significant damage, was done over the weekend [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=152.72s)]
*  in Iran. So let's talk about the assessments because they spent a lot of time trying to [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=159.36s)]
*  discredit that initial preliminary DIA take. And again, low confidence, very early. We understand [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=165.20000000000002s)]
*  there are lots of caveats there and it's been reported as such. We've now heard from the CIA, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=171.36s)]
*  we've heard from other places as well. Do you feel like this is being results of political pressure [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=175.36s)]
*  from the White House or are these good faith takes? I don't know what's causing it, but I do want, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  I guess as the national security editor, sort of explain what he said that was false. He said that [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=186.16s)]
*  the media, and specifically named us, has ignored these reports. Here is our report, our story last [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=191.52s)]
*  night that I personally published, written by my colleagues Dan DeLuz and Gordon Leubold. CIA says [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=197.2s)]
*  Iran's nuclear program severely damaged by U.S. strikes. As soon as that was said, we reported it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=202.56s)]
*  This story has the CIA assessment, Tulsi Gabbard's statement on this, the Israeli statement on this. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=207.76s)]
*  So many of the things he said, just about this mission and just about the press coverage was [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=213.28s)]
*  exaggerated. You mentioned D-Day. I mean, again, the most complex and historic operation in history. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=218.56s)]
*  There were 11,000, I looked this up, 11,000 aircraft involved in D-Day. 73,000 U.S. troops [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=224.16s)]
*  participated in it. 2,500 Americans died. And I don't know, again, what's causing him to say that [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=231.28s)]
*  President Trump carried out the most complex and historic operation in U.S. history, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=239.12s)]
*  but that's not true. And then Hegseth himself, in the very first briefing, said Iran's nuclear [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=243.35999999999999s)]
*  ambitions have been obliterated. And this goes back to this broader issue of what happened to [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=250.23999999999998s)]
*  the enriched uranium, and that's the question we should be talking about. It was a successful [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=256.32s)]
*  mission. I salute the men and women who carried it out, but I think distracting people by blaming [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=261.44s)]
*  the press and not addressing the real issues is, you know, again, national security needs facts [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=268.56s)]
*  and honest debate, and that's what's so concerning. Yeah, and the political overtones of this were set [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=274.72s)]
*  right from the beginning. Right before the news conference started, President Trump posted on [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=279.04s)]
*  Truth Social that he had heard the reporters involved from CNN and the New York Times were [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=282.48s)]
*  going to be fired. There's no evidence of that whatsoever. They're just doing their jobs. The [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=285.92s)]
*  tone of the political tone has been set from the Pentagon. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFc7y8xNiqY&t=290.8s)]
