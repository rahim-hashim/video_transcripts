# 'It was obscene': Senator, Army veteran, rebukes Trump over military parade
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg)
*  Millions of Americans took to the streets over the weekend to protest the actions of the Trump administration, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=0.0s)]
*  which came as the president held a military parade in Washington, D.C. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=5.44s)]
*  NBC News Chief Capitol Hill correspondent Ryan Nobles has more. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=10.32s)]
*  From Los Angeles, to Atlanta, to Chicago, and in the nation's capital, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=14.72s)]
*  organizers say more than five million Americans poured into the streets [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=24.8s)]
*  under the banner of No Kings, with the goal of sending President Donald Trump a message [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=29.759999999999998s)]
*  about the direction of his administration. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=35.44s)]
*  I didn't expect to be fighting fascism in my 50s. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=37.44s)]
*  The protests were in part a response to the administration's decision to host a grand [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=40.4s)]
*  military parade in Washington in honor of the Army's 250th birthday, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=45.6s)]
*  which just happened to coincide with President Trump's birthday. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=50.96s)]
*  Trump telling the crowd the day was about America's fighting force. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=54.96s)]
*  Every other country celebrates their victories. It's about time. America did too. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=58.96s)]
*  The parade crowds were moderate amid intermittent rain and intense security all around the route, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=65.36s)]
*  with those there calling the event a success. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  It's a patriotic. It's amazing. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=73.68s)]
*  But that celebration was juxtaposed by a mass mobilization in other parts of the country. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=76.48s)]
*  We just feel like that our democracy is in danger. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=82.16s)]
*  Protesters in thousands of demonstrations nationwide accusing President Trump of [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=85.36s)]
*  attempting to amass too much power and targeting innocent people in the administration's sweeping [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=90.16s)]
*  mass deportation program. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=96.0s)]
*  Well, we haven't had a king since 1776. We want to keep it that way. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=97.76s)]
*  Though largely peaceful, police say one person died when gunfire erupted at a protest in Salt [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=102.4s)]
*  Lake City, while in some others, demonstrators clashed with law enforcement. More than 30 were [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=107.76s)]
*  arrested in Denver and in Los Angeles after days of tension and conflict, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=113.84s)]
*  police accusing protesters of throwing rocks, bottles and fireworks at officers. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=118.88000000000001s)]
*  The city's downtown area remains under an 8 p.m. curfew as police attempt to keep the peace. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  NBC's Ryan Nobles with that report and joining us now, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=131.36s)]
*  Democratic Senator Tammy Darkworth of Illinois. She's a member of the Senate Armed Services and [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=134.4s)]
*  Foreign Relations Committees and is also an Iraq War veteran and recipient of the Purple Heart. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=138.64s)]
*  Senator, thank you so much for being here this morning. The vast, vast majority of these No [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=143.6s)]
*  Kings protests were very peaceful and the crowds were huge. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=148.16s)]
*  White House officials tell me that the crowd at the military parade, not what they had hoped, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=151.6s)]
*  certainly smaller than expected. What are your thoughts as a veteran about that spectacle we [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  saw this weekend about the military, the Army being honored for its 250th birthday, but also [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=161.44s)]
*  falling on President Trump's birthday? This was not about the Army's 250th birthday. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=167.2s)]
*  You wanted to celebrate the Army's 250th birthday and spend 60 million dollars. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=171.67999999999998s)]
*  You could have spent it on tuition for our troops, funding for military families. You could feed all [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=175.51999999999998s)]
*  the homeless veterans in this country. So if you truly wanted to celebrate the Army's 250th birthday, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=181.83999999999997s)]
*  then spend them the money the correct way, not with a parade for a tin pot dictator wannabe, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=186.56s)]
*  which is what Donald Trump is. I felt that it was obscene to have done that at a time when we're [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=192.16s)]
*  trying to cut funding for VA, when we're firing people from their jobs in federal government. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=197.2s)]
*  Frankly, we're the greatest military on the face of the earth. We don't need a parade to prove it. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=204.48s)]
*  Others pointed out the juxtaposition of the parade with ongoing conflicts around the globe. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=208.56s)]
*  Let's turn to the Middle East. You, of course, served in Iraq. What is your assessment of what [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=212.64s)]
*  you've seen so far in this? Is the Israel's attack on Iran? Iran has hit back a little bit. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  We've seen some of their rockets landed. Do you support what you're seeing here from Prime [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=221.28s)]
*  Minister Netanyahu in this attack? Well, let's start off by the fact that Israel has—I support Israel's [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=226.8s)]
*  right to defend herself. Israel is in a very, very scary neighborhood, and Israel is our only true [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=231.6s)]
*  real ally in the Middle East. That said, we got here because Donald Trump pulled us out of [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=237.36s)]
*  the Iran nuclear deal, allowed Iran to continue to work towards refining more uranium, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=243.12s)]
*  grow their nuclear program. So it's not surprising that Israel would hit back. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=250.39999999999998s)]
*  That said, we need to urge both sides to work towards peace. We do not need the Middle East [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=255.84s)]
*  to flare up into another full-blown conflict. I think that Iran probably underestimated what [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=261.44s)]
*  was going to happen. It seems like Israel has decapitated much of their leadership, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=266.71999999999997s)]
*  especially when it comes to the nuclear development program. But, you know, Donald [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=271.28s)]
*  Trump is supposed to be a dealmaker, right? And yet he couldn't bring both sides to the table and [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=276.0s)]
*  prevent this from happening. Yeah, he's still pushing for those talks. What do you get your [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=280.4s)]
*  opinion on what we talked about last segment with former General McCaffrey, an XCIA analyst, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=284.64s)]
*  about the idea that probably the U.S. would have to assist with a B-52 and these bunker-busting [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=290.48s)]
*  bombs if Israel was to really go after the deepest Iranian nuclear facility? Do you think, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=296.16s)]
*  would you be in favor of that move? I have to see what the conditions are. I don't usually [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=301.52s)]
*  commit to a vote beforehand. I would like to see what it is. I have always supported packages to [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=305.6s)]
*  help Israel, especially those defensive packages. I worry about getting the United States embroiled [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=310.40000000000003s)]
*  in yet another Middle East conflict that can last 10, 20 years. Look at what happened in Iraq and [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=315.6s)]
*  Afghanistan. But I stand by our ally Israel because they are the true allies that we have. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=319.28000000000003s)]
*  They provide us with intelligence. They have been there for the United States. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=325.36s)]
*  I happen to think Netanyahu is a war criminal. I don't trust him. And this is where if we had [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=329.36s)]
*  somebody who was competent in the White House, somebody who was competent in the Department of [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=334.24s)]
*  Defense, somebody who was competent at actually negotiating deals, I would have more confidence. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=337.28000000000003s)]
*  But right now, I don't have a lot of trust in the White House and its ability to actually bring this [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=342.48s)]
*  to a resolution. Let's quickly hit a couple of matters here at home. Over the weekend last night, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=347.04s)]
*  President Trump on Truth Social doubled down on ICE raids we saw in Los Angeles. He says he wants [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=351.04s)]
*  to expand that to a variety of blue cities, name-checking one in your home state, Chicago. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=356.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Well, because he's using these for his political expediency, right? He's doing this. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=361.44s)]
*  He's ginning up the unrest. He is separating American-born children from their families. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=367.28s)]
*  I'm all for deporting violent criminals. Let's deport the violent. Let's deport the violent [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=372.64s)]
*  criminals. But that's not what he's doing. He's actually doing political theater in order to [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=378.72s)]
*  come up with a pretext in which he can send in the National Guard. So he can send in the [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=383.12s)]
*  United States Marines. We just had to evacuate our embassy in Iraq. That's where the Marines [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=386.72s)]
*  should be, protecting Americans abroad. They shouldn't be on the streets of our country [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=392.08000000000004s)]
*  turning their weapons on fellow Americans. It is completely un-American, but this is all Donald [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=396.40000000000003s)]
*  Trump's doing. And Senator, in our final 30 seconds here, we obviously, this terrible incident in [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=401.12s)]
*  Minnesota, two state lawmakers shot, one killed. Just your concerns about the rise in political [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=405.76000000000005s)]
*  violence that we're seeing across the country. It's not acceptable. The rise in political violence [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=411.84000000000003s)]
*  is not acceptable. When I was elected, some people voted for me. Some people did not vote for me, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=415.68s)]
*  but I represent everybody in the state of Illinois. We should be working to bring down the [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=419.92s)]
*  level of rhetoric, the level of targeting of one another. And that starts with every one of us [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=425.12s)]
*  that's elected, but it also starts at the White House. The president can't go out there and make [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=430.88s)]
*  the statements he is. Some of my colleagues are making some pretty questionable statements on [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=434.56s)]
*  social media. That has no place in American politics or anywhere in America. Senator, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=438.08s)]
*  Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois. Senator, thank you so much for being with us this morning. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XabDKk75qg&t=443.84s)]
