# Joe: If you are a fiscal conservative, you can’t vote for this bill
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw)
*  OK, let's get right to the news. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=0.0s)]
*  The House Rules Committee is holding a meeting right now [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=2.12s)]
*  on the Republican Party's massive domestic policy [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=4.96s)]
*  bill to advance President Trump's legislative agenda. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=7.68s)]
*  The lawmakers convened at a 1 AM hearing [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=11.32s)]
*  to process and debate any changes to the legislation. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=15.8s)]
*  More than 500 amendments have been [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  submitted to the committee, most of them from Democrats. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=22.0s)]
*  This meeting comes after President Trump visited Capitol [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=25.42s)]
*  yesterday to pressure some party members [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=29.48s)]
*  to get on board with the bill. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=32.08s)]
*  Behind closed doors, Trump warned [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=34.08s)]
*  conservative hardliners against steeper cuts to Medicaid. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  He also criticized some blue state Republicans [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=40.84s)]
*  pushing to raise the state and local tax deduction [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=43.8s)]
*  cap known as SALT. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  President Trump spoke to reporters afterwards. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=49.08s)]
*  Who told you I said I'm going to get [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=53.32s)]
*  over here inside the room? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=54.68s)]
*  He said get to the line. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=55.68s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  Who told you that? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=57.760000000000005s)]
*  You heard from people inside the room. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=59.160000000000004s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=60.88s)]
*  That's true. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=61.38s)]
*  Totally true. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=61.88s)]
*  I never used the term. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=62.440000000000005s)]
*  I didn't say losing. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=63.36s)]
*  I didn't even talk about it. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=64.2s)]
*  In fact, it's the opposite. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=65.2s)]
*  I think we're going to get it done. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=66.4s)]
*  I'm not losing patience. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=67.84s)]
*  We're ahead of schedule. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=69.0s)]
*  Anybody that told you that is a liar. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=70.4s)]
*  And this morning, we're learning that House Republicans [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=74.16s)]
*  may be closing in on a deal to address [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=76.44s)]
*  the state and local tax deduction. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=78.32000000000001s)]
*  Four Republican sources familiar with the matter [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=80.6s)]
*  tell NBC News. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=84.04s)]
*  Yesterday, we had J-Mart on. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=85.47999999999999s)]
*  And basically, he said the ideology is Trump. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=88.83999999999999s)]
*  And if he goes to the Hill and he tells them what to do, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  they'll say, well, what's the process for it? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=98.63999999999999s)]
*  What's the ideology? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=100.47999999999999s)]
*  And he'll say, just get it done. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=101.63999999999999s)]
*  This was J-Mart yesterday morning. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=103.63999999999999s)]
*  And it looks like that's exactly what happened. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=105.08s)]
*  And now even on SALT, it looks like they're coming close [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=107.08s)]
*  to a deal on SALT. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=110.03999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, President Trump has reported [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=110.96s)]
*  have said in the room to Congress and Mike Lawler [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=112.76s)]
*  of New York, who's been pushing for a higher cap, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=115.2s)]
*  like a lot of other New York and some blue state Republicans [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=117.68s)]
*  saying, Mike, just drop it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=120.56s)]
*  So after all that, we'll see if they drop it fully. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=123.68s)]
*  But they may not get what they want, those Republicans. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=125.92s)]
*  And there are many sticking points. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=129.04s)]
*  By the way, Donald Trump supported [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=130.88s)]
*  raising the cap on SALT during the campaign. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=132.72s)]
*  But there are sticking points from conservatives [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=135.68s)]
*  like Chip Roy, who's saying, which you've been saying [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=138.12s)]
*  all along, Joe, is that we're supposed to be fiscally [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=141.12s)]
*  conservative as Republicans. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=144.08s)]
*  And if this passes in its current form or even close, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=146.16000000000003s)]
*  it's going to skyrocket the national debt [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=149.96s)]
*  well beyond what it was post-World War II. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=153.28s)]
*  Or they're gonna set a new record, 125%, 130% of GDP. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=155.72000000000003s)]
*  That's not supposed to be who we are. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=160.56s)]
*  So we'll see if they can hold the line there. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=162.84s)]
*  Well, I mean, they already set those records [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=164.52s)]
*  in Donald Trump's first term. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=165.88000000000002s)]
*  And now if you are on Capitol Hill [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=167.24s)]
*  and you claim to be a conservative, fiscal conservative, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=171.52s)]
*  you cannot vote for this bill. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=174.28s)]
*  I mean, I can't tell you how many times I was, you know, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=176.36s)]
*  shoved in back corners of leaders' offices [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=179.2s)]
*  and said, you have to do this or else. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=183.6s)]
*  You just can't do it. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=185.24s)]
*  Like, we determined we were going to balance the budget, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=186.68s)]
*  even if it meant that we were going to lose all support [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=191.44s)]
*  from everybody in leadership. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=194.88s)]
*  And we did. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=196.52s)]
*  And we still got reelected. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=197.76s)]
*  And we balanced the budget. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=198.92000000000002s)]
*  And these guys are sitting here and everybody's, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=200.12s)]
*  oh, what can I do? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=201.56s)]
*  What can I, my party's coming on, the president came. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=203.36s)]
*  You can say no. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=205.96s)]
*  You can just say no. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=207.96s)]
*  I mean, it worked for us. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=209.76000000000002s)]
*  And by the way, you don't need a ton of people to do it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=211.56s)]
*  We had like 11 people, 11 hard no votes. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=213.36s)]
*  And there aren't two or three people that don't wanna add, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=219.44s)]
*  like that are gonna go along with adding 10, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=224.44s)]
*  20 trillion dollars to the national debt. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=227.84s)]
*  I'm telling you, the crisis that's going to ensue [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=230.04000000000002s)]
*  from this fiscal insanity over the past 20 years, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=233.72s)]
*  I'm gonna say push mainly when Republicans are in office, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=237.32000000000002s)]
*  if you add up the numbers. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=240.52s)]
*  We're gonna come to a cliff, we're gonna fall over, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=243.20000000000002s)]
*  and it's all gonna come back to this vote. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=244.84s)]
*  This is the time they have to get serious. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=247.48000000000002s)]
*  Moody's is downgrading us. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=249.60000000000002s)]
*  You've got Ray Dalio and others on All Street warning. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=251.24s)]
*  It's much worse than you think it is. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=254.44s)]
*  Jamie Dimon's getting a little warning. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=256.52s)]
*  This is not a close call. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=258.2s)]
*  37 trillion going toward $38 trillion. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=261.76s)]
*  And I swear to God, I say it every year. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=266.24s)]
*  And every year they pass crazy budgets. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=268.68s)]
*  I don't get it. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=271.52s)]
*  And it's a fiscal crisis potentially, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=273.03999999999996s)]
*  but also make a political one [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=275.03999999999996s)]
*  with some of these Republicans, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=276.52s)]
*  especially in those swing districts saying, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=277.68s)]
*  you're gonna ask me to vote for somebody [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=280.24s)]
*  that gives a massive tax cut to rich people [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=281.68s)]
*  and to corporations. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=284.28s)]
*  But make all of these other cuts somehow to make up for it. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=286.24s)]
*  You want me to get rid of a bunch of Medicaid for people? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=289.16s)]
*  Oh my God. That's not gonna work for me politically, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=292.32s)]
*  some of these Republicans are saying. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=294.48s)]
*  Let's bring in US special correspondent for BBC News [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=295.88s)]
*  and the host of the Rest is Politics podcast, Cady K. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=299.04s)]
*  The host of Way Too Early, Capitol Hill reporter as well, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=304.04s)]
*  Ali Vitale, and chief White House correspondent [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=307.24s)]
*  for the New York Times, Peter Baker. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=309.92s)]
*  Ali, let's start with you and get the lay of the land [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=312.44s)]
*  what's happening in Congress with this situation right now. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=314.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, they're keeping Way Too Early and Morning Joe hours [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=318.08s)]
*  and we love to see it, honestly. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=321.0s)]
*  I love when more people are awake with us, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=322.44s)]
*  but look, they're actually quite behind schedule here [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=324.08s)]
*  in the rules committee. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=326.59999999999997s)]
*  They were expecting all of these amendments [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=327.96s)]
*  to be introduced by like five or six o'clock this morning. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=329.91999999999996s)]
*  They're still hearing from the more senior members [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=332.96s)]
*  on some of these committees. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=335.55999999999995s)]
*  There you see Jim McGovern, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=336.76s)]
*  who's one of the Democrats on the rules committee, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=337.91999999999996s)]
*  holding court there [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=340.23999999999995s)]
*  as this rules committee hearing continues on. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=341.47999999999996s)]
*  There's the procedural piece [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=343.96s)]
*  of what we're gonna see this morning. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=345.23999999999995s)]
*  It's gonna look like more testimonials [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=346.68s)]
*  from Democrats and Republicans alike, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=348.59999999999997s)]
*  but then it's also going to be the introduction [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=350.91999999999996s)]
*  of hundreds of amendments. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=353.68s)]
*  We could potentially see some votes on those [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=355.03999999999996s)]
*  in the rules committee later this morning. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=356.96s)]
*  And then what we're really anticipating [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=359.03999999999996s)]
*  is this so-called manager's amendment [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=360.91999999999996s)]
*  that the speaker or another member of Republican leadership [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=362.88s)]
*  will basically drop into this bill [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=365.88s)]
*  and it will show the concessions and negotiations [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=367.76s)]
*  that Johnson has been having [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=372.28000000000003s)]
*  with key members of the Republican conference. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=373.84000000000003s)]
*  So I would imagine that one of the things we see in there [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=375.92s)]
*  is the agreement that they've come to on SALT, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=378.16s)]
*  at least our understanding is that the SALT cap deduction [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=380.52000000000004s)]
*  would be raised to $40,000 [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=383.20000000000005s)]
*  for people making less than $500,000 a year, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=385.28000000000003s)]
*  and then it would go up 1% annually [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=388.52000000000004s)]
*  and then stay there after 10 years. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=391.08000000000004s)]
*  So a win for the SALT caucus, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=393.16s)]
*  or at least one that they could get behind [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=395.24s)]
*  despite being told to drop it. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=397.56s)]
*  And then the other piece of this [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=399.36s)]
*  that we're waiting to see [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=400.56s)]
*  is what happened with Medicaid work requirements. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=401.68s)]
*  The concern from some hardline conservatives [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=404.96s)]
*  was that these new restrictions didn't snap in soon enough. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=407.35999999999996s)]
*  And so they wanted to see those clauses come into play sooner. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=411.4s)]
*  Chip Roy and Ralph Norman and other hardliners [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=414.68s)]
*  that we often talk about [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=416.91999999999996s)]
*  have been negotiating hard on pieces like that [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=418.08s)]
*  that could be cost saving mechanisms [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=420.68s)]
*  that assuage some of their concerns on the deficit. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=423.2s)]
*  But I have to tell you, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=425.56s)]
*  I think that Joe's read on this situation is right, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=426.44s)]
*  which is that despite people who have been deficit hawks, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=430.16s)]
*  Trump coming in and saying just pass this thing [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=433.20000000000005s)]
*  honestly is likely enough here. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=435.96000000000004s)]
*  And it doesn't tackle a lot of the deficit concerns [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=437.84000000000003s)]
*  that these conservatives said that they care about. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=441.12s)]
*  So Peter Baker, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=443.28000000000003s)]
*  you had the president of the United States yesterday [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=444.12s)]
*  just telling every Republican, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=445.88000000000005s)]
*  it's time to get on board enough. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=447.32000000000005s)]
*  Let's get this one big, beautiful bill [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=448.96000000000004s)]
*  as they're calling it through Congress. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=450.88s)]
*  He's asking though, as Joe and I were just discussing, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=452.44000000000005s)]
*  conservative Republicans to vote for something [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=455.24s)]
*  that projects almost $4 trillion added to the deficit [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=457.48s)]
*  over the next decade or so. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=461.96000000000004s)]
*  So I guess the question is, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=463.8s)]
*  do you stick to your principles as a conservative [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=465.72s)]
*  or loyalty to the president? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=467.96000000000004s)]
*  Well, I mean, look, you know, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=471.20000000000005s)]
*  what we've seen time and time again [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=472.40000000000003s)]
*  is that somebody's hard right conservatives [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=474.40000000000003s)]
*  will make their displeasure known with bills like this. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=476.6s)]
*  They'll gum up the works for a while, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=481.40000000000003s)]
*  but then Trump will come in, crack the whip, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=483.32s)]
*  and then ultimately they go along. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=485.12s)]
*  And so far, there's nothing to suggest [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=486.88s)]
*  that Trump doesn't continue to have, you know, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=488.84s)]
*  the dominant hand in this party. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=491.08s)]
*  That's why they sent him to the Hillia Show. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=493.71999999999997s)]
*  He's not negotiating details. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=495.28s)]
*  He doesn't know the details probably all that well. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=496.71999999999997s)]
*  It's not his thing. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=498.88s)]
*  His thing is there to go up there and say, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=499.91999999999996s)]
*  look guys, time's up, enough of this, get on board. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=502.0s)]
*  And he has made clear to them the consequences [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=505.84s)]
*  if they don't. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=508.91999999999996s)]
*  Those who don't get on board when he counts, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=509.76s)]
*  when he's paying attention, they get primaries, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=512.24s)]
*  or at least that's the threat. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=514.68s)]
*  And they know that he sometimes makes good on that [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=516.1999999999999s)]
*  and the fact that he has more popularity [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=518.12s)]
*  among their constituents than they do. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=520.24s)]
*  So it's a technique that's worked for him over the years. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=521.9599999999999s)]
*  It's also worth remembering [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=525.1999999999999s)]
*  that you're asking these house members, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=526.36s)]
*  these Republicans, to take a vote on something [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=527.64s)]
*  that's not even gonna last. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=529.8399999999999s)]
*  This is not gonna be the final version of the bill. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=531.1999999999999s)]
*  It's gonna go to the Senate. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=532.9599999999999s)]
*  Senate's gonna do a very different thing with it. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=533.8s)]
*  We don't know exactly how it'll be different, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=535.24s)]
*  but you may end up as a house member [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=537.0799999999999s)]
*  taking a vote to do something [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=538.56s)]
*  that won't be in the final bill, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=539.76s)]
*  but you'll pay a cost for it politically back home anyway. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=541.0s)]
*  Yeah, and, Catty, as I said yesterday, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=543.88s)]
*  that happened to Democrats in 1993. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=546.96s)]
*  They were BTU'd, as they said, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=549.52s)]
*  where they were forced to vote for something in the House [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=552.2800000000001s)]
*  that didn't even survive the Senate bill [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=554.2800000000001s)]
*  and it ended up costing them. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=556.0s)]
*  And it's so fascinating. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=557.4s)]
*  This is, here we are 10 years later [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=558.9200000000001s)]
*  still saying the same thing, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=561.44s)]
*  where there are some members in districts [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=563.12s)]
*  that need to go along with Donald Trump [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=564.88s)]
*  to win the primary, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=567.6800000000001s)]
*  but going along with something like this bill [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=569.1600000000001s)]
*  will likely make some of these people [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=572.68s)]
*  that won in Biden districts [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=574.92s)]
*  actually endangered politically [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=576.2399999999999s)]
*  and most likely will make them lose the election. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=578.5999999999999s)]
*  And we just keep seeing this cycle over and over again, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=582.2399999999999s)]
*  and you just wonder when people [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=585.7199999999999s)]
*  actually start worrying about, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=587.4399999999999s)]
*  one, what's best for the country, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=588.8s)]
*  and two, what gives them the best chance [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=590.52s)]
*  to win a general election? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=593.28s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, why is Mike Lawler [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=594.9599999999999s)]
*  pushing for more salt deductions? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=596.3199999999999s)]
*  Because he's living in a blue state [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=599.0s)]
*  where Donald Trump pushed up the tax costs [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=600.56s)]
*  for people living in his district, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=603.6s)]
*  and he knows that he has to campaign against that. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=605.08s)]
*  But you're right on what's best for the country. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=607.52s)]
*  I mean, the warning signs are everywhere. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=609.3199999999999s)]
*  That trip I just took talking to European business members, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=611.12s)]
*  this was a topic of conversation, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=614.88s)]
*  Joe, that came up repeatedly, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=616.88s)]
*  like what is the health of the American economy? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=618.4s)]
*  Should we now be looking at [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=621.0s)]
*  reweighting our investments out of the United States? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=623.12s)]
*  The American market has been fantastic for investors. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=626.04s)]
*  Ever since 2008, it's been booming, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=628.64s)]
*  but there's a real sense around the world now, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=630.9599999999999s)]
*  particularly in Europe, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=632.5999999999999s)]
*  that this is not the place to put your money. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=633.68s)]
*  America is too risky, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=635.52s)]
*  and the thing that is risky is partly the politics [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=637.0799999999999s)]
*  are too volatile and the tariffs, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=639.88s)]
*  but the other thing that is risky [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=641.4799999999999s)]
*  is this underlying financial irresponsibility, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=642.5999999999999s)]
*  that the debt is just out of control. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=645.3199999999999s)]
*  So, Peter, to you, when members are debating these issues, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=646.9599999999999s)]
*  just to Joe's point, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=651.52s)]
*  how many of them are actually just thinking [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=652.88s)]
*  about their short-term survival, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=655.52s)]
*  and how many are thinking this is actually potential? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=657.0s)]
*  There are a lot of warning bells out there. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=660.64s)]
*  Ray Dalio is not the only one who's saying, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=662.6s)]
*  this is a crisis looming. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=664.52s)]
*  How many of them are thinking, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=666.0s)]
*  my God, this could be something really serious, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=667.08s)]
*  that we're on the brink of? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=669.36s)]
*  Well, you've never lost money making bets in Washington [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=671.32s)]
*  on short-term imperatives over long-term health [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=673.84s)]
*  of a country, no question about that, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=678.9200000000001s)]
*  and you're right, they're looking at [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=681.2800000000001s)]
*  what happens in the next two years, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=683.44s)]
*  not what happens in the next 10 years, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=685.0s)]
*  not what happens in the next 20 years. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=686.24s)]
*  Remember, Elon Musk told us in last year's campaign [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=687.72s)]
*  that they would be cutting the deficit, not adding to it. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=691.0400000000001s)]
*  He was asked at that Madison Square Garden rally, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=693.32s)]
*  right before the election, I was there, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=696.0400000000001s)]
*  how much would we cut out of the deficit [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=697.76s)]
*  if Trump gets elected? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=699.32s)]
*  He said, we'll cut $2 trillion [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=701.0s)]
*  out of the $6 trillion annual spending from the government. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=702.76s)]
*  Instead, of course, rather than cutting anything [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=707.08s)]
*  that will change the overall fiscal picture, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=709.88s)]
*  they're adding to it. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=712.36s)]
*  They've made a lot of cuts, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=713.2s)]
*  they've hurt a lot of agencies, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=714.02s)]
*  thrown a lot of people out of work, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=715.28s)]
*  but they're simply adding to the deficit anyway [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=716.96s)]
*  through big spending on certain items that they care about [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=719.0400000000001s)]
*  and through tax cuts that will cost the Treasury [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=722.9200000000001s)]
*  even more money over the next 10 years than previously. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=726.64s)]
*  So the truth is this has been a bipartisan issue [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=730.0400000000001s)]
*  for a lot of years, there's not been much of a constituency [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=733.64s)]
*  for long-term fiscal health in this country, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=736.8000000000001s)]
*  really since the 90s when Joe was in Congress, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=739.32s)]
*  really since the Bill Clinton, Republican Congress era [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=741.2800000000001s)]
*  when they balanced the budget. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=744.6s)]
*  It has not been a political imperative [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=746.28s)]
*  to care much about the deficit, frankly, for either party. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=748.5600000000001s)]
*  They give lip service to it, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=750.92s)]
*  but the last serious effort to make any real dent [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=752.0s)]
*  in the deficit was more than a decade ago [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=756.04s)]
*  during Obama's presidency. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=758.96s)]
*  It didn't last very long. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=760.32s)]
*  That's been a victory of short-term over long-term [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=761.8s)]
*  for quite a while now. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=766.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj7aGwLppHw&t=776.24s)]
