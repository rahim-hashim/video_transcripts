# Israel, Iran trade direct strikes as conflict escalates
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E)
*  Out of the conflict that's of course escalating in the Middle East between Israel and Iran, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=0.0s)]
*  as both countries keep trading direct strikes with each other. Earlier today, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=4.16s)]
*  the Israeli military said it struck the command center of Iran's Quds Force, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=9.68s)]
*  as well as missile sites in the central part of the country, citing Iranian state media. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=14.4s)]
*  NBC News is reporting that Israeli strikes in Iran have killed over 220 people since Friday, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=19.6s)]
*  with over 90 percent of the fatalities reported to be civilians. The initial Israeli strikes took [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=25.04s)]
*  out multiple Iranian military leaders and top nuclear scientists. On Friday, Iran launched [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=30.799999999999997s)]
*  ballistic missiles into Tel Aviv and has continued its attacks in the days since. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=35.84s)]
*  Overnight, missiles hit the northern Israeli city of Haifa. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=40.64s)]
*  office released a statement this morning saying 24 Israeli civilians have been killed in that [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=46.56s)]
*  retaliatory attack. With us now live from Tel Aviv is NBC News international correspondent Matt [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=51.76s)]
*  Bradley. Matt, what can you tell us about the situation as it stands right now? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=58.08s)]
*  Well, I can tell you, Joe, what I saw, what I heard late last night here in the southern part [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=64.24s)]
*  of Tel Aviv. I was woken up in the middle of the night, as I have been for the past couple of days [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=68.72s)]
*  and nights, including during the day. We saw a brazen daytime attack by the Iranians just yesterday. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=72.88s)]
*  We get up, we hear this siren, you hear these alerts on your phone, everybody rushes into these [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=79.36s)]
*  safe rooms or sort of bunkers inside these buildings. And I got to tell you, Joe, this is [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=84.72s)]
*  what is the cause of these low fatalities amongst Israelis. You saw in the numbers you just gave, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=89.2s)]
*  the numbers of Iranian civilians who have been killed in Israeli attacks are about 10 times the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=95.68s)]
*  number that we're seeing killed here in Israel. And we went yesterday to Bat Yam, which was one [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=101.2s)]
*  of the areas also here in southern Tel Aviv, where there was an entire 10-story building, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=106.48s)]
*  but the front of it just sheared right off. Six people were killed, a very high number of civilians [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=112.24000000000001s)]
*  killed in one attack by Israeli standards. But according to the IDF, the Israeli Defense Forces, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=117.68s)]
*  everybody who was killed had not managed to make it to the safe rooms, to these bunkers. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=124.56s)]
*  So really, the reason why we're seeing such a low fatality is because of the early warning systems, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=129.2s)]
*  because of the Iron Dome, the Aero systems, the other air defense systems like David Sling that [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=133.92s)]
*  have been swatting a lot of these Iranian projectiles out of the sky, and because almost [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=138.95999999999998s)]
*  every building in this country has one of these bunkers, has one of these safe rooms that allows [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=143.92s)]
*  people to get to cover and that essentially means you're going to survive in almost every case if [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=150.0s)]
*  you make it to one of these rooms. So that's why we're seeing such a low level of casualties [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=155.76s)]
*  here in Israel. In Iran, we're also seeing a move to targeting economic targets. Oil facilities [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=160.08s)]
*  and gas fields, that's a big escalation by the Israelis. All right, NBC's Matt Bradley, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=167.52s)]
*  live from Tel Aviv. We greatly appreciate it. Please stay safe. And with us, we have now the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=173.84s)]
*  co-host of our fourth hour, contributing writer of The Atlantic, Jonathan O'meer, president emeritus [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=179.20000000000002s)]
*  of the Council on Foreign Relations, Richard Haas, and co-founder and CEO of Axios, Jim Van De Hei. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=184.4s)]
*  So Richard Haas, let's begin with you. The situation continues to escalate with Israel and [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=191.04000000000002s)]
*  Iran trading attacks against each other. I guess the question that's being asked right now by a [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=197.76s)]
*  lot of observers is how much longer can Iran continue this? It seems in just about every [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=204.56s)]
*  category Israel has the upper hand. What are you hearing? Well, Joe, for Iran, they've got to decide [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=211.12s)]
*  just that. And in particular, let me give you one analogy. When they were fighting the Iran-Iraq war, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=218.96s)]
*  the decade-long struggle in the 80s, the Ayatollah Khomeini at one point said, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=224.4s)]
*  he'd never accept a ceasefire, and then he did. And he said, this is like drinking poison to me. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  But he decided to drink poison in order to preserve the Iranian revolution. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=235.04s)]
*  So the question is whether the authorities in Iran essentially find this an analogous situation, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=240.4s)]
*  and they would accept some type of a peace deal. We can talk about that, what the details would be, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=246.32s)]
*  or whether they basically say they worry they can't survive after this defeat militarily, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=252.72s)]
*  and they go the opposite direction, which would be war-widening, to essentially try to bring the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=259.12s)]
*  Arabs into the war, to attack oil refineries and installations, attack shipping. And the theory [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=265.04s)]
*  behind that would be they could then make the war so expensive for the United States and Europe [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=271.04s)]
*  that they would hope that the U.S. would put diplomatic pressure on Israel to end the war. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=276.64000000000004s)]
*  So I think the Iranian authorities are very much coming to that fork in the road, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=281.44s)]
*  where they've got to decide whether to widen and escalate on one hand, or whether to begin to get [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=285.68s)]
*  diplomacy in gear and to bring this to an end. And then they would have to decide, sorry, go out so [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=291.6s)]
*  long, how much they would give up on the nuclear side. So, Richard, let me ask you, for those of [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=296.32000000000005s)]
*  us who have seen since 1979 Iran being the epicenter of global terrorism, of being, you know, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=302.40000000000003s)]
*  the most feared power in the Middle East outside of Israel, the question is how did their defenses [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=310.96000000000004s)]
*  become so stripped down? How did they become so weak? How have their air defenses been crushed [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=317.76s)]
*  to a point now where they really are at the mercy of Israel? Israel can do just about anything that [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=324.64s)]
*  it wants to do with Iran. What happened? When did it happen? Why are they so ill-prepared? The New [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=330.0s)]
*  York Times reporting that they're not even communicating with their people. They don't [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=335.76s)]
*  have the bomb shelters that Israel has. People are standing on top of the roofs because they [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=339.12s)]
*  don't have bomb shelters to go to. What's happened? Why was this supposedly fearsome Islamic, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=343.44s)]
*  Islamist republic, why are they now seemingly helpless? I have two thoughts about that. It's [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=351.36s)]
*  a really interesting question. One is they had a layered defense. Think about it. You had Hezbollah. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=359.6s)]
*  You had Hamas. You had the friendship with the Syrian government. So they had all these proxies [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=364.56s)]
*  and partners getting help from Russia, from China. And their strategic position just deteriorated [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=370.24s)]
*  dramatically over the last year. And then secondly, Israel took it to them in ways that my guess is [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=377.52s)]
*  they didn't imagine. That the Israelis, almost like the Ukrainians and the Russians, had upped [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=384.08s)]
*  their game and introduced a new level of warfare. And the Iranians, I think, were, I guess the word [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=389.12s)]
*  I would use is complacent. They thought they could hide behind their proxies above all Hezbollah, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=394.40000000000003s)]
*  which they thought was keeping Israel in check. And they just didn't imagine the degree of [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=399.92s)]
*  innovation that Israel could bring to the war. And they were essentially a generation or two behind. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=405.52000000000004s)]
*  Now, let's bring in our columnist and associate editor for The Washington Post, David Ignatius, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=412.88s)]
*  to get more insights on this. I guess, David, the question right now is, as escalation continues, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=417.44s)]
*  and again, as Iran seems at least, based on the reports we've heard, to be basically helpless [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=423.6s)]
*  from stopping these Israeli attacks, even they're saying as much. Question is, why would Israel stop [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=428.8s)]
*  against an implacable foe who, since their creation in 1979, has made their existence [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=434.88s)]
*  about the destruction of Israel and the destruction of America about as much as anything else? It's [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=440.32s)]
*  hard to see Netanyahu, who the world couldn't bring to the peace table for Hamas or Hezbollah, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=446.8s)]
*  hard to imagine Netanyahu basically stopping the attacks now that Iran seems so helpless. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=454.16s)]
*  What are you hearing? So, Joe, first, I think your description is entirely accurate. Israel now has [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=461.68s)]
*  operational control of the skies, certainly over Tehran, and it appears over much of Iran, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=469.2s)]
*  in a way that it can just choose targets now. It decides it's going to take out the Quds Force [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=476.4s)]
*  leadership, and it appears in an operation overnight that they did just that. It's said [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=480.8s)]
*  that they could have targeted the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, but decided against it. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=487.04s)]
*  So they get to choose targets now, but there isn't really a target that says, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=492.8s)]
*  here's how to end the war. I think Israel faces a problem a bit like what it faces in Gaza. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=497.52s)]
*  You can have total dominance. Gaza is just almost undefended, and yet Israel's had trouble [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=505.04s)]
*  ending the war, getting somebody with whom it can make a deal that finally brings the conflict [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=513.36s)]
*  to an end and who is prepared to surrender to Israeli power. You're not going to find an [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=519.28s)]
*  Iranian surrender mandate until you have regime change there. So I think inevitably, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=524.96s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu in Israel has talked more and more over the last several days about [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=532.5600000000001s)]
*  a regime change option. Talking yesterday to Iranians who monitor the situation back home [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=538.88s)]
*  very closely, their view is that the Israelis are not really much closer to having a regime change [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=547.9200000000001s)]
*  plan than they are to having a strategy for a new Gaza. They're not good at that strategic [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=557.5200000000001s)]
*  thinking. So I think that's really the bottom line for me today, Joe, is how do the Israelis [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=563.5200000000001s)]
*  imagine bringing this to an end? They're going to have increasing pressure from, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=569.9200000000001s)]
*  I think, from President Trump, who would like to be the peacemaker, who's talking with [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=573.84s)]
*  the Russian president Putin about what appears to be a joint effort for peace. The Israelis are [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=578.4000000000001s)]
*  going to have to have a very clear, well-enunciated plan for where they go next to resist the pressure [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=584.56s)]
*  that they'll make down the war. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IsBQ0hR_E&t=591.3599999999999s)]
