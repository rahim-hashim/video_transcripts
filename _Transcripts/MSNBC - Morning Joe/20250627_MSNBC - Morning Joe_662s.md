The president on Thursday also delivered remarks from the East Room on the bill.

# ‘The clock is ticking’: Senate Republicans rush to save budget bill after blow to Medicaid cuts
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA)
*  We will dive right in, beginning with Republicans now facing a major setback after a Senate official [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=0.0s)]
*  ruled against a series of health care cuts and savings in their sweeping domestic policy bill. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=6.96s)]
*  The nonpartisan Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth McDonough disqualified several provisions, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=13.84s)]
*  including one that prohibits federal funding of Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  program for adults or kids whose immigration status cannot be immediately verified, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=26.96s)]
*  as well as changes in how states can tax Medicaid providers. Senate Majority Leader John Thune [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=32.24s)]
*  called the setback a quote speed bump and told reporters that he has contingency plans in place. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=39.44s)]
*  But Senator Tommy Tarpeville of Alabama took a far harsher tone calling for Thune to fire the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=46.32s)]
*  parliamentarian ASAP. Others in the Senate called for her to be overruled, which can happen by a [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=52.32s)]
*  civil majority, but Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri threw some cold water on that idea. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=58.88s)]
*  Well, President Trump has urged all congressional Republicans to get behind the so-called One Big [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=82.72s)]
*  Beautiful Bill, warning any members of the GOP from voting against it. During an event at the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=90.72s)]
*  White House yesterday, Trump said Americans would benefit from the tax cuts in the measure [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=96.24s)]
*  and that the bill would create millions of jobs and grow the economy, while also falsely stating [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=101.52s)]
*  it includes no taxes on Social Security benefits. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=107.04s)]
*  They know who I am talking about. I call them out. But we don't need grandstanders. We have to get [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=137.04s)]
*  our country back and bring it back strong. And our country is going to be stronger, bigger, better [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=142.16s)]
*  than ever before. Stronger, bigger, better. One person that I've spoken to, Democrats and [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=147.12s)]
*  Republicans, about this bill, Gene, who is saying to me, well, one thing that they do think is that [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  the Democrats' chances in the midterms are stronger, bigger and better if this bill passes as it is. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=156.0s)]
*  Absolutely. It's not a popular bill. I mean, it's not. There are provisions in this bill for, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=161.68s)]
*  you know, various groups to hate, for everybody to hate. There's something in there. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=168.8s)]
*  Make a bill that big. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=173.76000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=175.28s)]
*  There are probably going to be things that everybody can hate. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=176.08s)]
*  This is literally more than a kitchen sink bill. Everything is in there. The entire legislative [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=177.84s)]
*  agenda of this Trump administration is in this one bill. And so, of course, there are members [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=182.08s)]
*  of the House and members of the Senate who don't like various provisions of this bill, even if and [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=190.96s)]
*  when they corral all the Republicans into supporting some version of this bill with this [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=198.0s)]
*  script and that script. I think they have a real problem going into the midterms. I really do. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=204.72s)]
*  I can't get over a couple things here. One is the process, which is they haven't finished writing [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=210.08s)]
*  this thing. They're still going to vote on it tomorrow. It's crazy to me that there's not been [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=216.32s)]
*  a single hearing in the Senate. They don't have a budget analysis. They don't have an analysis of [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=223.92s)]
*  how many people will be impacted by the Medicaid cuts. They don't actually know what's in the bill. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=228.95999999999998s)]
*  They have to rewrite the bill and they're still going to vote on it tomorrow. I mean, it's madness. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=233.12s)]
*  Let's just call it what it is. It's total madness. We've never seen anything like this happen before. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=236.88s)]
*  What does that mean? I mean, they are actually going to vote on it tomorrow. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=241.6s)]
*  It's the plan as of now. They're going to start the first vote tomorrow as of now. I don't know. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=246.95999999999998s)]
*  Maybe not, but the idea is to get to the President's desk by July 4th. That's seven days. Again, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=252.64s)]
*  it's crazy and if it were to happen in the reverse direction, Republicans would rightfully bemoan [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=258.96s)]
*  how absurd this legislative process is. The second thing, which is maybe more substantive, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=265.12s)]
*  but I also can't get over, is that the cuts to this bill on the Medicaid side specifically, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=270.24s)]
*  the people that are going to be harmed are actually Republicans and Trump voters in the majority. Now [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=276.08s)]
*  it's obviously not exclusive to them, but because of the political realignments, we're talking about [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=281.2s)]
*  rural hospitals. We're talking about maga types who depend on Medicaid. Republicans are going to [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=287.04s)]
*  make a huge hit to their own coalition, to their own interests, and you're starting to see some kind [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=291.76s)]
*  of realize this. I mean, Tom Tillis, for instance, the senator from North Carolina, who's up this [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=298.24s)]
*  cycle, he's been like, I can't do this until I recognize how bad the hit is going to be in my [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=302.48s)]
*  state on Medicaid because his people, his voters, his coalition will take the brunt of this. I don't [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=309.04s)]
*  think I've ever really witnessed a party self-sabotage in this type of fashion as the Republicans are doing [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=315.04s)]
*  right now, all because they're extremely worried about offending Donald Trump. Yeah, I was talking [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=322.4s)]
*  to a former Republican senator just this week who was saying, yeah, but health care is never up there [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=328.32s)]
*  in voting issues. You never see it ranking. It's not an issue. And actually the argument that [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=333.03999999999996s)]
*  the Democrats with him were making is, yeah, but this is not health care. This is an affordability [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=337.84s)]
*  issue. And affordability is the issue of the moment. That is what everyone is talking about. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=342.15999999999997s)]
*  Of course, actually, really, health care is just affordability under another guy's. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=347.12s)]
*  Do you think it gets to the president's desk by July 4th? Are we taking bets this morning? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=352.79999999999995s)]
*  I'll take bets. Hey, no one else is here, so we may as well have stuff on the line. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=357.52s)]
*  I want the underline. We may as well pay for money. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=361.03999999999996s)]
*  Sam has the DraftKings app for legislative measures as well. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=364.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm a polymarket guy. Come on. I mean, the president wants it. I mean, July 4th is a week from [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=368.4s)]
*  today. So that seems the clock is indeed ticking, but we're going to see a lot of pressure. It's [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=373.68s)]
*  really begun in the last day or so from President Trump to trying to push this through by hell or [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=378.32s)]
*  high water. And it is. It's a test. Will Republicans ever stand up to him? And we know if passed his [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=383.68s)]
*  prologue, very few ever will. But we're seeing a little bit of dissent right now, at least on the [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=388.96000000000004s)]
*  edges. And for more on that, let's bring in NBC News senior national politics reporter, Jonathan [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=393.92s)]
*  Allen. John, good to see you this morning. It is striking that Josh Hawley, who is about as [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=398.32s)]
*  MAGA as it comes, first of all spoke out a few months back about the Medicaid cuts and then [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=402.88s)]
*  yesterday take a, you know, somewhat reasonable tone about the Senate parliamentarian. Like, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=409.92s)]
*  maybe he doesn't like the ruling, but he's like, well, we have to live with this. That's part of [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=415.36s)]
*  the institution. We don't have the votes to overturn it. So what is your read here in terms of [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=418.8s)]
*  the willingness for Republicans to defy Trump? What other recourse do they have after this being [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=425.84s)]
*  dealt a significant blow yesterday? Well, I think the point that Sam makes is the right one, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=431.52s)]
*  which is that nobody's read the bill yet. And as a result of that, the reason that I say that is [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=436.56s)]
*  that this is now the time for them to fight. You know, eventually this thing will come to the floor. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=441.59999999999997s)]
*  The odds are that it will pass. Historically, when presidents have their own party in power in the [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=447.44s)]
*  House and Senate, they get the one big thing that they want done passed. So you would have to expect [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=452.88s)]
*  that that's going to happen. So they're fighting about it right now. But you mentioned Josh Hawley [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=458.0s)]
*  and look, Josh Hawley understands what Tom Tillis from North Carolina understands, which is that [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=461.92s)]
*  MAGA populism isn't taking away, or at least it shouldn't in theory be taking away health insurance [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=466.72s)]
*  from poor rural people in order to fund tax cuts for the ultra wealthy. And so Trump is trying to [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=473.04s)]
*  get this bill through. There are a lot of different interests. This has been the idea of slashing [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=481.76s)]
*  Medicaid by as much as a trillion dollars in budgets has been something that has been a hobby [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=486.08s)]
*  horse of Russ Vogt, the Office of Management and Budget Director for at least the last 20 years. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=491.2s)]
*  And so this is an ideological push going on from the White House, hitting right into a real [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=496.15999999999997s)]
*  politique or practical politics of senators like Hawley and Tillis who don't want to take [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=503.03999999999996s)]
*  benefits away from their own constituents. One thing that President Trump can do, John Allen, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=508.71999999999997s)]
*  is read polls and the polls are really bad on this. We've seen a wave of them. First of all, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=515.04s)]
*  most Americans, frankly, like legislators, don't know what's in the bill just yet. But what they've [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=521.4399999999999s)]
*  heard, they don't like. And they particularly worry about these cuts, cuts to services, cuts [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=526.24s)]
*  to Medicaid. And so many of them will disproportionately hurt Trump voters. And then [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=530.16s)]
*  President Trump is usually pretty protective of his base. But in this case, he really seems to be [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=536.3199999999999s)]
*  favoring the rich who are going to benefit from the tax cuts that are part of this, as opposed to [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=541.04s)]
*  these sort of rank and file Trump voters. So many of them live in red districts or rural districts. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=546.16s)]
*  Are you surprised by it? And are Republicans in the building behind you aware that they're [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=552.0s)]
*  staring at a deeply unpopular bill and therefore potentially facing a real blowback at the midterms [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=557.76s)]
*  next year? Yeah, I think they are. But we've seen this movie before, John, and then where, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=563.4399999999999s)]
*  you know, there is a president in their first two years of their term who is pushing unpopular [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=570.1600000000001s)]
*  legislation. And they're asking the members of Congress in their own party to walk the plank on [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=576.5600000000001s)]
*  it and to basically put the party goal ahead of their own goal of reelection. It's easy to remember [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=582.32s)]
*  the 2010 elections after Obamacare passed and the sort of public backlash to that with the Tea Party. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=588.88s)]
*  So, you know, I think that this is a dynamic that's well settled. But yes, the people in [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=596.0s)]
*  the building behind me are acutely aware that they are risking certainly their House majority, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=601.36s)]
*  risking some Senate seats by moving forward with this bill. And at the same time, the vast majority, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=607.12s)]
*  because of redistricting, because of the way our politics are polarized, the vast majority of people [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=613.76s)]
*  in the building behind me are not actually on the line themselves, which makes it a lot easier to [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=618.0s)]
*  vote for the thing that the president wants. Yeah, good point there just about how there are so few [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=622.24s)]
*  competitive seats these days. But we know of a couple senators who are worried. NBC News [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=627.2s)]
*  senior national politics reporter Jonathan Allen. John, thank you so much. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiaaTM_HZuA&t=632.08s)]
