# 'Enraging': Writer slams evangelicals for silence on gutting program to combat AIDS in Africa
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4)
*  So speaking of government cuts, Pete, in your new piece of the Atlantic, you examine the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump administration's dissolving USAID, the main U.S. organization that provided humanitarian [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=5.26s)]
*  aid, and the primary agency that implemented the extremely successful program to combat [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=11.32s)]
*  AIDS in Africa, one known as PEPFAR. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=17.92s)]
*  In the piece, you explore why evangelicals turn their back on PEPFAR. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=20.72s)]
*  And Mike Barnicle, you'll take it to Pete, but this was something that was a signature [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=26.48s)]
*  accomplishment of the George W. Bush administration. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=30.4s)]
*  Sort of some odd bedfellows, Bono, Leeds interview too was heavily involved there as well. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=33.88s)]
*  And it's something that Democrats cheered, and that up until this moment has been widely [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=38.68s)]
*  acclaimed and seen as a stunning success and a great use of American power overseas. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=45.92s)]
*  Saved literally maybe half a million lives, maybe more lives in Africa, PEPFAR. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=53.6s)]
*  And now it's been diminished, maybe disappeared. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=59.48s)]
*  And Pete, my question to you is off of what David was saying, the initial decision yesterday [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=63.56s)]
*  that a lot of people seem to be overreacting to, doesn't this, given the context of the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=67.88s)]
*  Trump administration's planning thus far when they've come into office, they're far better [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=74.32s)]
*  prepared to deal with governing, if that's what you want to call it, than they were during [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=79.96s)]
*  the first Trump administration. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=85.08s)]
*  Does not this decision allow them to start dismissing employees and start diminishing [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=87.11999999999999s)]
*  existing programs right away before the final conclusion of this event, legal event? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=93.28s)]
*  I think that's right, Mike. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=99.6s)]
*  I think that's right. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  I mean, I'll defer to David on the legalities of it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=102.19999999999999s)]
*  I think the practical effects of it is really what we need to focus on, which is they shuttered [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=105.04s)]
*  USAID and have crippled PEPFAR, the global AIDS initiative President Bush started. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=111.04s)]
*  And the humanitarian catastrophe that that is causing and will cause is almost unfathomable. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=116.92s)]
*  Twenty-six million lives have been saved since PEPFAR started in 2003. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=122.56s)]
*  It had, as you mentioned, bipartisan support. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=128.24s)]
*  It was renowned as a program that was efficient and accountable. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=131.88s)]
*  And there was no reason to get rid of it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=136.84s)]
*  And yet they have gotten rid of it through an executive order of 1416-9. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=139.44s)]
*  So this is one of the great humanitarian interventions in human history. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=144.32s)]
*  It's one of the greatest and medical interventions in human history, one of the greatest humanitarian [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=148.92s)]
*  acts in American history. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=153.26s)]
*  And they went after it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=155.57999999999998s)]
*  And they went after it for no good reason. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=157.04s)]
*  It was intentionally malicious. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=161.07999999999998s)]
*  It was wanton cruelty. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=164.35999999999999s)]
*  And since that executive order went into effect, more than 80,000 people have died. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=166.88s)]
*  The estimates are that if it's not replaced the money and program, that more than three [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=171.6s)]
*  million will die by the end of the decade. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=178.76s)]
*  And USAID, 14 million may die. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=180.92s)]
*  They have blood on their hands. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=184.34s)]
*  This had to have been an intentional attack against a program which was just pocket change [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=187.72s)]
*  for the U.S. government. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=192.52s)]
*  And the fact that evangelicals have been so silent on this was really the thrust of my [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=195.88s)]
*  essay. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=199.4s)]
*  And for me, as a person who's been for so much of my life in the evangelical world, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=200.4s)]
*  it's a very painful and frankly enraging thing to witness. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=207.08s)]
*  They really, by and large, with exceptions, they really don't care much. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=211.28s)]
*  And Jesus would have. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=215.60000000000002s)]
*  Well, Pete, I swear I don't understand. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=217.84s)]
*  I mean, you know, you read the red letters. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=219.84s)]
*  You read Jesus' words. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=225.48000000000002s)]
*  You go through the Gospels. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=228.36s)]
*  This is not a close call. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=230.8s)]
*  This is not a close call. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=233.28s)]
*  When you have the richest man in the world slashing programs that will cause the poorest [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=236.28s)]
*  of God's children in the world to starve or die because PEPFAR has been shut off, when [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=247.07999999999998s)]
*  you have the richest actually implementing programs, destroying programs that are meant [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=256.68s)]
*  to save the poorest of God's children, again, not a close call. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=266.2s)]
*  There are a lot of things that our faith allows us to look at from different vantage [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=271.88s)]
*  points here. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=278.8s)]
*  I mean, this is, again, this is, you look at PEPFAR, 25 million lives saved, you know, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=279.8s)]
*  many people calling it the greatest government program ever. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=290.84s)]
*  And as far as in terms of helping the world, this, it just, why? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=296.04s)]
*  Why have so many evangelicals turned a blind eye to the poorest among us, the poorest [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=303.04s)]
*  of God's children? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=312.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's such a good question, Joe. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=313.56s)]
*  And I wrestled with it, and I reached out to about 30 pastors. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=316.48s)]
*  And I heard a lot of responses I got. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=320.36s)]
*  It was complicated to some extent. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=324.2s)]
*  I mean, some were just ignorant of it, which is something about the evangelical ecosystem. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=325.88s)]
*  But a lot of them didn't know about it. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=330.6s)]
*  Others were, had told me that they were busy with ministries and homelessness and refugees [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=333.36s)]
*  and others. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=342.0s)]
*  And others said, we don't want to politicize the church. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=345.6s)]
*  And many were fearful that if they spoke out against the program that Donald Trump supported, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=347.6s)]
*  that there would be backlash. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=351.76s)]
*  And there would. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=353.52s)]
*  But look, at the end of the day, this is not a hard call. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=354.52s)]
*  As you said, this is red letters. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=359.56s)]
*  If you took the teachings of Jesus, the ethic of Jesus, this is exactly the kind of thing [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=361.79999999999995s)]
*  that would break his heart if he knew that this was being ripped out like life support [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=368.4s)]
*  systems out of a wall. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=375.76s)]
*  Let me tell you one example, because I heard, Joe, and this may interest you and Mika, I [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=377.79999999999995s)]
*  heard from pastors, you said, well, you know, what are we supposed to do? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=382.4s)]
*  Do we call our congressman? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=385.35999999999996s)]
*  Do we call our senator? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=386.59999999999997s)]
*  What are the levers that we have? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=389.15999999999997s)]
*  And I end the essay in the Atlantic by comparison in 2014, World Vision, which is a wonderful [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=390.71999999999997s)]
*  humanitarian organization that's Christian. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=396.79999999999995s)]
*  They changed their policy and said that they could hire they would hire same sex couples [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=399.96s)]
*  to work at World Vision. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=405.96s)]
*  And it was like a bomb going off. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=407.71999999999997s)]
*  The walls came in. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=409.84000000000003s)]
*  Evangelicals attacked it. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=411.8s)]
*  Franklin Graham did. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=414.04s)]
*  Al Mohler did. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=415.12s)]
*  Others did. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=416.24s)]
*  And within two days, World Vision reversed course because children were going to die [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=416.96000000000004s)]
*  because people were withdrawing. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=422.44000000000005s)]
*  Evangelicals were withdrawing their sponsorship because of that. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=424.0s)]
*  So there you have an eruption because an organization wants to hire same sex individuals. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=427.72s)]
*  Now you have the decimation of a program that saved a quarter of 25 million lives. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=434.16s)]
*  And that because it's been decimated will cost many more millions of lives. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=442.08s)]
*  And there's hardly a peep. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=447.40000000000003s)]
*  And that is kind of a CAT scan on the evangelical soul, not all the evangelicals, of course, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=449.84000000000003s)]
*  but enough that it's heartbreaking. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=458.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, contributing writer for The Atlantic, Pete Wehner and New York Times opinion columnist [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=461.76s)]
*  David French. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=468.04s)]
*  Thank you both very much for being on the show this morning. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rok_2opJl4&t=469.04s)]
