# Steve Rattner: 'Most amazing piece of social legislation in the wrong direction we have ever seen'
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [July 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc)
*  As promised, former Treasury official and Morning Joe economic analyst Steve Ratner [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=0.0s)]
*  joins us now with charts on the impact of the new spending law on Americans. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=5.1000000000000005s)]
*  So Steve, where do we begin? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=11.32s)]
*  Where do we begin? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=14.66s)]
*  Let's begin over here, Mika, with what's actually in the bill. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=15.66s)]
*  And I think the conversation between Joe and Heilman before the break was really an important [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=19.66s)]
*  one, which I'll get into in a second. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=24.1s)]
*  Essentially, I think, as most people know, this would extend the tax cuts in the 2017 [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=25.82s)]
*  Trump tax cut bill. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=31.2s)]
*  They were going to expire. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=32.6s)]
*  That was a budget gimmick they did in 2017 to make it look like a smaller deficit was [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=33.6s)]
*  going to occur. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=38.08s)]
*  So now we're going to add $2 trillion. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=39.08s)]
*  Increases in the standard deduction, increases in the child tax credit, and then the important [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=41.879999999999995s)]
*  priorities of this administration anyway, border and immigration spending, defense spending, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=46.8s)]
*  the goodies that Trump promised during the campaign. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=52.06s)]
*  No tax on overtime, no tax on deducting your car loan interest, no tax on tips, senior [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=54.82s)]
*  bonus deduction, and then the other side of the coin, $278 billion out of student loan [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=60.620000000000005s)]
*  payments that will be less, phasing out the IRA, $540 billion, so important for our climate [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=68.18s)]
*  change efforts, and then the big one, the Medicaid cuts of $841. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=74.74000000000001s)]
*  As Heilman said before, all the good stuff takes effect now. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=79.16000000000001s)]
*  People are going to get these increases in their standard deduction, in their child tax [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=82.80000000000001s)]
*  credit. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=86.4s)]
*  The Social Security Administration has already sent out a letter to Social Security recipients [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=87.4s)]
*  saying you're going to get a big tax windfall from this bill. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=92.48s)]
*  They overstated what they're going to get, of course. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=95.36s)]
*  So they're already out there marketing this. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=97.88000000000001s)]
*  The bad stuff doesn't take effect for the most part until after the 26th midterm elections. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=99.9s)]
*  So these people, whatever else they are, they're probably not stupid, and they staggered this [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=105.74s)]
*  stuff in a way that could work to their political advantage or at least less political harm. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=110.42s)]
*  But again, for those of us who have been concerned about the deficit and debt for decades, and [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=116.94s)]
*  you and I were talking about this during the Obama administration as well, so it's certainly [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=123.74s)]
*  not just focused on what parties in the White House, unlike unfortunately every Republican, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=129.26s)]
*  just about every Republican in the House and the Senate. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=135.84s)]
*  This is also a great way to make the deficit explode even more. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=139.28s)]
*  We're going to give you all the goodies now and all of the cuts, the difficult cuts that [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=145.12s)]
*  we're going to make to try to offset them a little bit. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  We're going to push down the road. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=153.89999999999998s)]
*  So again, makes a reckless bill even more reckless, right? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=155.24s)]
*  Absolutely, and I'll show you those deficit numbers in just a second. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=159.34s)]
*  But in terms of the actual total impact on the deficit, Joe, to your point, this bill [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=162.9s)]
*  is $3 trillion, assuming they're playing the same game again of having some stuff expire [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=168.06s)]
*  to make it look cheaper. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=173.5s)]
*  Three trillion dollars if they leave it as written, so stuff expires, if they make everything [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=175.10000000000002s)]
*  permanent, $3.7 trillion. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=182.18s)]
*  Three trillion bigger than the House version, the Senate added a bunch of goodies. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  They then moved some stuff from the temporary to the permanent bucket, so it's a little [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=191.44s)]
*  bit less, but we can call it somewhere in this range of three to four trillion dollars. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=194.68s)]
*  But let's put that in perspective. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=199.18s)]
*  The bipartisan infrastructure law under Biden, $400 billion. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=200.98000000000002s)]
*  The American Rescue Plan, which the Republicans love to trash, and to your point, talk about [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=205.04000000000002s)]
*  how it was a deficit buster and so on and so forth, $1.8 trillion, so much less than [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=210.68s)]
*  all this. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=215.12s)]
*  And then the CARES Act during COVID of 1.7, and even the original Tax Cuts and Jobs Act [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=216.34s)]
*  from 2017, $1.5 trillion. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=221.56s)]
*  So this truly can be described as the mother of all bills, the mother of all deficit-busting [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=225.42000000000002s)]
*  bills that we have seen in history, really. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=230.46s)]
*  And Steve, you're also looking at income inequality. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=234.74s)]
*  How will that be impacted? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=237.62s)]
*  Yeah, so let's talk about two ways in which many Americans are going to be affected. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=239.16s)]
*  The first one is Medicaid. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=243.64s)]
*  We've talked a lot about Medicaid. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=245.61999999999998s)]
*  The Senate version actually increased the amount of Medicaid cuts from $760 billion to [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=247.38s)]
*  $841 billion. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=252.38s)]
*  The consequence is that something around 11 million people are projected to lose their [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=254.57999999999998s)]
*  Medicaid over the coming decade. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=259.58s)]
*  And so after Obamacare was passed, the Affordable Care Act, we did a really great job of reducing [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=262.24s)]
*  the uninsured population in this country. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=268.2s)]
*  And this is going to send it halfway back to where we were. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=270.76s)]
*  I do not know of an example in history where we have instituted a major social benefit [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=273.78s)]
*  like Obamacare, ACA, whatever you want to call it, Medicaid, and then rolled it back [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=279.68s)]
*  so much. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=285.0s)]
*  This is unprecedented in our history. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=286.0s)]
*  We've always moved forward, not backwards. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=287.91999999999996s)]
*  Now, if you remember one thing from what I'm saying today, remember what's on this chart, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=290.32s)]
*  because we've talked a lot about how it helps the rich, hurts the poor. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=296.06s)]
*  Let's just put some numbers around that. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=299.78000000000003s)]
*  If you're in the top 20% of the country, you're going to get an average $6,000 benefit. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=301.82s)]
*  These green arrows are what you get from tax cuts. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=306.86s)]
*  The red arrows are what you lose from some of the spending cuts. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=309.62s)]
*  But these people at the very top are going to get a 2.3% increase in their after-tax [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=312.62s)]
*  income and benefits and what they get from the government, essentially. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=317.78000000000003s)]
*  If you go down here to the bottom 20%, what do you see? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=321.56s)]
*  These people are actually going to be worse off. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=325.08s)]
*  They get a very small tax cut, but it is completely, wildly offset, but what they lose from Medicaid [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=327.48s)]
*  cuts, from food stamp cuts, from other cuts, and so they end up actually, $560 worse off, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=334.48s)]
*  minus 2.3%. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=341.48s)]
*  Again, I would say in 50 years of watching economic policy, I have never seen a package [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=342.48s)]
*  that was so regressive, that did so much to take money from the poor, give it to the rich, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=348.72s)]
*  and take it away from the poor. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=353.9s)]
*  This is unprecedented in our history. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=355.21999999999997s)]
*  It is the most amazing piece of social legislation in the wrong direction that we have ever seen. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=357.21999999999997s)]
*  Well, you actually have massive tax cuts for billionaires, massive tax cuts for multinational [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=363.21999999999997s)]
*  corporations, the slashing of health care for people in rural America, in red state [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=370.82s)]
*  America, also in blue state America, those who are truly disadvantaged. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=377.1s)]
*  And Stephen, goes even beyond that. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=382.0s)]
*  You have the National Institute of Health being slashed by 35%, 40%, according to some [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=384.44s)]
*  estimates. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=393.2s)]
*  The National Cancer Institute being slashed by well over a third. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=394.52s)]
*  You have science, research on science, and other R&D funding that has kept America at [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=401.15999999999997s)]
*  the forefront of the technological boom, the scientific boom, the medical boom, medical [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=409.74s)]
*  research boom. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=418.74s)]
*  It's kept us ahead of the rest of the world. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=420.22s)]
*  Talk about how these areas are getting slashed, whether you're talking about research for [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=423.74s)]
*  cancer, research for Alzheimer's, research for Parkinson's, research for breast cancer, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=429.88s)]
*  for every other form of cancer and other treatments. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=439.2s)]
*  Talk about how for some reason, Republicans decided to give billionaires tax cuts, decided [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=443.03999999999996s)]
*  to give multinational corporations tax cuts, and decided to gut research to make people [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=448.55999999999995s)]
*  healthy, to help cure people of cancer, to give people with Parkinson's and Alzheimer's [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=456.52000000000004s)]
*  and their family hope. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=462.84000000000003s)]
*  You're absolutely right, Joe. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=465.88s)]
*  This is the most extraordinarily anti-science administration, also certainly in modern history. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=466.88s)]
*  You could describe what you just went through as eating our seed corn. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=472.84000000000003s)]
*  We're getting rid of all the stuff that are the important building blocks for our future. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=477.28000000000003s)]
*  Things like basic research, NIH, which you mentioned, and so forth, are things that only [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=483.18s)]
*  the government can do. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=487.46s)]
*  The private sector is not going to do this. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=488.46s)]
*  If we stop doing it, it is really going to have a major impact on our future livelihood. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=490.82s)]
*  Let's turn back to the deficit thing that you mentioned, Joe, because there the news [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=496.53999999999996s)]
*  is also so terrible. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=500.26s)]
*  This black line is our baseline. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=501.9s)]
*  This is what would happen to the deficit, even if we did nothing. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=503.5s)]
*  You can see it continues to climb. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=506.53999999999996s)]
*  It's just under $2 trillion at the moment. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=508.58s)]
*  It would go down a little, but then it would just relentlessly climb. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=510.48s)]
*  If you add in the bill as it is written, you can see it climbs more. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=513.84s)]
*  If you add in, assuming everything gets made permanent, which I think is a reasonably safe [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=518.26s)]
*  assumption given how Congress operates, you could see the deficit would go from under [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=522.0s)]
*  $2 trillion to over $3.2 trillion per year. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=526.2s)]
*  This is every single year, this is what would happen. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=530.4399999999999s)]
*  You add all the stuff up, and you're talking about the extra $3 trillion over there that [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=533.64s)]
*  I showed you, but also just the existing deficit would add more than another $20, probably [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=538.24s)]
*  around $25 trillion to our existing national debt of $37 trillion. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=543.66s)]
*  Take it to levels not just in dollars, but as it relates to the size of our economy that [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=549.5s)]
*  we've never seen before. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=554.5600000000001s)]
*  Now you might say, oh, this would be kind of okay if we got some economic benefit out [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=556.22s)]
*  of it, but that does not seem likely to happen. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=560.08s)]
*  All five of these are projections done by independent research institutes of what would [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=564.6600000000001s)]
*  happen to economic growth under this bill. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=569.32s)]
*  One of them shows a little bit of growth. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=572.48s)]
*  This is a slightly right-leaning organization. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=573.9200000000001s)]
*  All the rest of them essentially show very little. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=576.4000000000001s)]
*  One even shows some loss of economic growth at the beginning and the end of this period. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=579.2800000000001s)]
*  So essentially, you've got five independent organizations saying no impact on growth. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=583.6s)]
*  What does the White House say? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=588.94s)]
*  The White House says you're going to have a massive positive impact on economic growth. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=590.32s)]
*  This is the addition to growth you'd get from the bill. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=595.5600000000001s)]
*  This would take economic growth. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=598.12s)]
*  If this actually happened, it would be our fastest level of economic growth since 1984. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=599.7600000000001s)]
*  So I'm betting these people are going to be right. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=605.0400000000001s)]
*  And not only are people at the bottom of the ladder, as we saw, not going to get much, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=607.98s)]
*  the country as a whole is not going to get much in terms of economic growth. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=612.2s)]
*  Morning, Joe, economic analyst Steve Ratner. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=617.22s)]
*  Thank you very much for your charts this morning. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqVkwfpsZc&t=620.14s)]
