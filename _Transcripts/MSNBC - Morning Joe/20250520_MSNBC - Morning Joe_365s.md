# 'Is this The Onion? No, it's real life': Capehart on DOJ opening investigation into Chicago mayor
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4)
*  The Justice Department has charged a Democratic congresswoman from New Jersey with assaulting [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=0.0s)]
*  federal agents during a clash earlier this month outside of an immigration detention [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=5.96s)]
*  center in Newark. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  Acting U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, Alina Habba, made the announcement on social media [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=12.88s)]
*  yesterday accusing Congresswoman LaMonica McIver of quote, assaulting, impeding, and [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=18.64s)]
*  interfering with law enforcement. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=25.900000000000002s)]
*  In response, McIver called the charges purely political and said she looks forward to quote, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=28.04s)]
*  the truth being laid out clearly in court. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=33.64s)]
*  McIver was one of three Democratic members of the New Jersey Congressional delegation [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=36.68s)]
*  present at the Newark ICE facility on May 9th. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  The three have maintained they were on site to inspect the facility in their capacity [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=47.84s)]
*  as lawmakers conducting federal oversight. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  Meanwhile, Habba said her office has dropped trespassing charges against the mayor of [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=57.08s)]
*  Newark, Ras Baraka. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=62.68s)]
*  He was arrested on May 9th while at the same Newark ICE facility with his Democratic colleagues. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  Baraka said he was glad the charges were dismissed, adding that he expected McIver to be vindicated. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=70.76s)]
*  Let's bring in the president of the National Action Network and host of MSNBC's Politics [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=76.92s)]
*  Nation, Reverend Al Sharpton, and the co-host of MSNBC's The Weekend. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=81.64s)]
*  Poets are prize-winning journalist Jonathan Capehart. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=87.24s)]
*  He's out today with a new memoir entitled, Yet Here I Am, Lessons from a Black Man's [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=90.04s)]
*  Search for Home. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=96.44s)]
*  And we'll talk about the new book. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=98.64s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=99.8s)]
*  Thanks, Mika. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=100.8s)]
*  In just a moment. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=101.8s)]
*  That's wonderful. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=102.8s)]
*  So, I've seen a lot of the different angles of this revile on social media and obviously [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=103.8s)]
*  we'll have to see what plays out in court, but it appears that the members of the delegation [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=109.8s)]
*  believe they had a right to enter the facility and inspect it, and they were kept out, and [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=116.8s)]
*  that's when the scuffling began. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=121.44s)]
*  What are you hearing about this, about especially what this woman, the charges she's facing, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=123.48s)]
*  McIver, and what happened? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  I'm hearing that they welcomed the day in court to prove what happened. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=131.88s)]
*  I thought it was very interesting that they charged Congresswoman McIver and dropped the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=136.4s)]
*  charges against the mayor over the same scuffle. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=143.6s)]
*  Then what did you arrest the mayor for in the first place if McIver was the one you're [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=147.72s)]
*  saying did the assaulting? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=152.12s)]
*  You can't have it both ways. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=154.28s)]
*  It seems like a major glaring contradiction to say, all right, the mayor didn't do anything [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=155.68s)]
*  wrong but she did, but we didn't arrest her at the site. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=161.51999999999998s)]
*  We arrested him. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=165.0s)]
*  So why did you arrest him then? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=166.08s)]
*  And then why did it take you a week to come back and arrest her? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=168.08s)]
*  I think they were trying that both ways. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=171.44s)]
*  I think that according to what I know, these were members of Congress that had federal [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=174.44s)]
*  oversight and a mayor that's dealing with a facility in his city trying to find out [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=180.88s)]
*  what's going on in that facility. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=186.0s)]
*  He'd been there several days. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=188.04s)]
*  So the question is, did they have the right to stop them from inspecting and seeing what's [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=190.36s)]
*  going on? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=195.24s)]
*  And I think that they may end up with a court hearing that they do not want to have because [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=196.24s)]
*  how are they going to explain how they barred or tried to bar three members of Congress [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=201.20000000000002s)]
*  from seeing people that were under federal custody? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=206.52s)]
*  So Jonathan, this is not the only high profile matter right now involving Department of Justice [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=209.08s)]
*  and elected officials. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=213.44s)]
*  DOJ says it's opening an investigation into the city of Chicago after comments from its [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=214.44s)]
*  mayor, Brandon Johnson. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=219.56s)]
*  While speaking at a church on Sunday, the mayor highlighted the prominent black officials [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=221.52s)]
*  in his administration. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=225.72s)]
*  The assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division announced yesterday that its [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=227.56s)]
*  investigation will try to determine whether the mayor's office has engaged in a pattern [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=231.28s)]
*  or practice of racial discrimination. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=237.76000000000002s)]
*  You have a look of disbelief on your face. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=239.48000000000002s)]
*  And certainly, there's certainly been criticism growing that DOJ is sort of deliberately looking [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=242.14000000000001s)]
*  for these high profile, provocative investigations into elected officials, namely Democrats. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=250.76s)]
*  Right, sort of. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=256.28000000000003s)]
*  No, they are. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=257.32s)]
*  This is exactly what they're doing. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=258.6s)]
*  I'm sorry, I had to, I was like, wait, is this the onion? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=260.32s)]
*  No, this is real life. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=263.24s)]
*  This is exactly what they're doing. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=264.7s)]
*  And let's keep in mind why they're doing this. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=266.68s)]
*  We talk about it all the time. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=269.2s)]
*  You guys talk about it all the time. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=270.84000000000003s)]
*  It's for intimidation. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=273.0s)]
*  What it means is to intimidate the president's critics into staying silent. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=274.76s)]
*  And when you see ridiculous things like that in Chicago, folks can't help but rise up and [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=280.56s)]
*  speak out. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=288.88s)]
*  I mean, people beyond, beyond rev, like people who would normally not get involved in situations [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=289.88s)]
*  like this. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=296.44s)]
*  The mayor of Chicago is showing the people of Chicago that he has a government that looks [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=297.44s)]
*  like their city. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=304.03999999999996s)]
*  That's all he's doing. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=306.03999999999996s)]
*  And what's also equally, what's offensive about why they're opening this investigation, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=307.44s)]
*  what, so because these officials are black, they are not qualified to be in those positions? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=312.68s)]
*  And that is criminal. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=317.91999999999996s)]
*  I mean, to act like this criminal to make sure that everyone has representation is a [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=318.91999999999996s)]
*  threat to everyone. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=324.15999999999997s)]
*  I talked to some ministers in Chicago last night that are not socially involved that [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=325.15999999999997s)]
*  are outraged at this. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=329.44s)]
*  I mean, what are you saying? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=330.56s)]
*  He's not saying that we did this expensive, but he's showing pride. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=331.8s)]
*  If I said, look at the amount of women we have at a certain place, is that something [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=336.04s)]
*  that I should be investigating for? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=341.84000000000003s)]
*  This is absurd. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRV0JRyX5X4&t=343.72s)]
