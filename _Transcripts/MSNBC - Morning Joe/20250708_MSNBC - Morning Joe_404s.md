# 'Stop cutting the weather service's budget': Fmr. NOAA official slams staff cuts
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [July 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA)
*  Joining us now, former principal deputy administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=0.0s)]
*  NOAA and co-host of the Cientista podcast, Monica Medina. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=5.78s)]
*  Monica, thanks so much for being here this morning. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=10.52s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=12.6s)]
*  It's just devastating to know that those little girls were in those cabins, and if there had [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=13.6s)]
*  just been a siren at 1 o'clock in the morning when that alert went out at 1-14, that it [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=19.44s)]
*  was in fact an emergency, that their lives might have been saved. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  What do you take as you listen to all the stories, the data, and everything you know [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=29.02s)]
*  about the way our weather works? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=33.5s)]
*  First of all, I just want to say how heartbreaking this is for any parent to imagine this kind [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=35.34s)]
*  of a horrible thing happening to their child. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=41.22s)]
*  And I hope that this will mean that the president will stop mocking climate change as an existential [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=44.58s)]
*  threat because for those 100 souls, it was an existential threat. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=50.019999999999996s)]
*  And it is an existential threat for Americans all across the country. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=55.14s)]
*  It's touching everyone. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=58.66s)]
*  What I take away from this is that it was preventable. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=59.86s)]
*  There are things that we can do. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=63.86s)]
*  I know sometimes we feel powerless in the face of climate change, but we know that weather [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=65.74s)]
*  is getting more and more extreme. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=71.16s)]
*  We know that this particular part of Texas was called Flash Flood Alley. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=73.5s)]
*  We had the ability to make small changes to be able to prevent something like this. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=78.56s)]
*  No weather radio. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=85.7s)]
*  It's something that's available and you can buy it in stores and it will warn you in the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=87.66000000000001s)]
*  middle of the night. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=92.58s)]
*  You don't have to have a siren system if you don't have one in place. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=93.74000000000001s)]
*  And it may take a while before Texas decides to put one in place. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=96.54s)]
*  But there are things you can do now. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=100.78s)]
*  We can also stop cutting the weather services budget. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=102.80000000000001s)]
*  Right now, our weather system is stretched to the breaking point. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=106.60000000000001s)]
*  The particular weather office in this location had lost its meteorologist in charge. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=110.94s)]
*  A hydrologist, the kind of person whose very job it is to predict these kinds of inundation [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=116.18s)]
*  events and to prepare people for them. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=122.22000000000001s)]
*  And we can't replace with AI those personal connections. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=125.26s)]
*  The people in those communities, this is not some bureaucrat as the congressman who represents [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=130.18s)]
*  that district called the bureaucrats in Washington in the weather service. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=135.64000000000001s)]
*  It was not bureaucrats in Washington. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=139.98000000000002s)]
*  It was local forecasters. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=141.82s)]
*  The connected tissue with local emergency managers who were being cut. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=144.3s)]
*  One took an early buyout. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=150.16000000000003s)]
*  Other positions are not being filled. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=152.16000000000003s)]
*  This is crucial at a moment in time when we know these extreme storms are getting worse [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=154.74s)]
*  and worse and whether it's heat waves or fire or a flood or a hurricane, we know we are [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=160.0s)]
*  up against a wall with climate change and we need to do things to prepare. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=165.26000000000002s)]
*  And you talked about cutting federal funding. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=170.62s)]
*  Also there are some movements in the state. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=173.02s)]
*  Attack local taxpayers. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=174.54s)]
*  Rejected the idea of paying for a more elaborate warning system. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=175.54s)]
*  So right now, as I think a lot of communities across this country are looking around, could [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=179.9s)]
*  we be next? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=184.14s)]
*  What are some immediate steps that towns, local governments, states could take to try [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=185.54s)]
*  to make something like this safer? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=191.54s)]
*  It's not big picture climate change. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=193.46s)]
*  Those solutions are going to come from higher levels, but just the day to day. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=195.62s)]
*  Those local, well several things. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=198.9s)]
*  Local officials need to step up their efforts. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=202.3s)]
*  Clearly, the federal government and the Trump administration is saying we're not going to [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=204.38000000000002s)]
*  take this on anymore. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=208.38000000000002s)]
*  They're cutting FEMA and saying it's on you states to make these changes. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=209.46s)]
*  And they should. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=213.46s)]
*  Texas is the most flood prone state in the country. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=214.46s)]
*  I know that's probably surprising. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=217.82000000000002s)]
*  We think about it as a dry place. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=219.26000000000002s)]
*  But there are hurricanes that will hit the Gulf Coast this summer. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=221.42000000000002s)]
*  Those NOAA weather radios are lifesavers. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=224.84s)]
*  And they seem like old tech. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=227.58s)]
*  Yes, I know. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=229.26000000000002s)]
*  In places where cell phones don't work. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=230.66s)]
*  In places where perhaps you're not going to get the warning with a lot of time, you need [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=233.02s)]
*  that siren. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=238.1s)]
*  So local officials can start to build up their preparedness with more first responders in [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=239.22s)]
*  place with more of that kind of outreach. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=245.74s)]
*  What we used to call a phone tree in the old days where you're actually going town door [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=248.62s)]
*  to door helping your neighbors out. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=253.94s)]
*  Used to be that we had government helping us, federal, state and local. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=256.22s)]
*  Now it's going to be on individuals to take actions to protect themselves. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=260.4s)]
*  Don't expect that someone's going to warn you. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=264.76s)]
*  If you think you're at risk, do something. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=267.03999999999996s)]
*  You heard one of those first responders say, well, we didn't know whether it was worth [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=270.23999999999995s)]
*  it to actually evacuate people. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=273.28s)]
*  Now we know these storms are so strong, so powerful, so deadly that if you worry that [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=276.23999999999995s)]
*  you might be at risk, you might actually want to take action yourself right away. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=282.47999999999996s)]
*  I think it is on all of us to try to make up for the losses of these federal supports [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=288.40000000000003s)]
*  and state and local supports. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=293.88s)]
*  And they come so fast. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=296.32s)]
*  These storms, that flash flooding, it happens like that. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=297.32s)]
*  But you know, in this case, yes, the warning came at one o'clock in the morning, but much [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=300.64000000000004s)]
*  of that wall of water took a few hours to make its way down the river. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=304.88s)]
*  And people sat and thought, we used to think about this with tornadoes, how much time in [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=310.44s)]
*  advance do you need? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=315.04s)]
*  People had time to wonder, should I evacuate? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=317.02000000000004s)]
*  Now they need to just evacuate. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=320.06s)]
*  That's the situation we're in. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=322.18s)]
*  And people who have the ability to purchase weather services on their phones, businesses [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=323.26s)]
*  may be able to be warned, but individuals, and particularly those who are vulnerable, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=331.74s)]
*  need to act. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=335.94s)]
*  And part of the appeal of those camps is that there are no phones. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=336.94s)]
*  For parents, anyway, you get to have a summer without technology, and it costs sometimes. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=340.42s)]
*  The camp administrators had phones. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=346.18s)]
*  They had the ability. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=348.3s)]
*  People are making choices now that are impacting our lives. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=349.53999999999996s)]
*  And we need to take action. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=354.14s)]
*  We need to let our politicians know at every level we expect them to put these systems [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=355.3s)]
*  back in place, to restore the funding, not cut it. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=360.14s)]
*  And we need to be on alert ourselves and take action, take matters into our own hands. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=363.78s)]
*  Otherwise, we are sitting ducks. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=370.74s)]
*  We're a deputy administrator of NOAA, Monica Medina. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=372.53999999999996s)]
*  Monica, thanks for being here. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=375.14s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=376.14s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrJQvUEuMlA&t=377.14s)]
