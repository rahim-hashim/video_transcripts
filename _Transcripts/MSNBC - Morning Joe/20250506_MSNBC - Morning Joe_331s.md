# AOC makes 'seniority' dig when turning down bid for top Oversight Committee post
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho)
*  Let's move to politics now. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is passing on the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=0.0s)]
*  chance to seek the top Democratic position on the Oversight Committee. The New York Democrat [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=6.16s)]
*  ran for the job last year but lost to Congressman Jerry Connolly, who's now stepping back from [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  the role for health reasons. She cited her party's preference to select more senior members [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  of Congress for leadership roles as an obstacle to a potential run. Ocasio-Cortez has been [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=23.32s)]
*  drawing large crowds alongside Senator Bernie Sanders at rallies around the country in opposition [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=29.88s)]
*  to President Trump's policies. We have nobody ever said that Congress was a meritocracy. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=36.48s)]
*  I understand that AOC may be more progressive than a lot of people. I also understand that [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=42.64s)]
*  she's one of the most articulate, exciting people in the Democratic field. She goes out [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  with Bernie Sanders. She's good at hearing, too. She draws so many people. She's very [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=55.6s)]
*  good, very effective in hearings. We've seen a lot of people. Nancy Pelosi was a progressive. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=59.92s)]
*  When Nancy became leader, she realized she needed to represent the entire caucus. AOC [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=65.2s)]
*  certainly could do that as well. After the election, she was going around talking to [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=70.08s)]
*  people who voted for her and Donald Trump, saying, I want to understand why did you do [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=74.08s)]
*  What don't I understand? Listen, Democrats, and we're going to talk to Dave Weigel about [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=80.64s)]
*  this in a second, their approval rating is just absolutely disastrous. They don't need [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=87.28s)]
*  to keep getting people in retirement, past retirement age, being their voice. They need [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=93.84s)]
*  somebody young like AOC. And again, it's not about ideology. You know, she can carry the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=103.16s)]
*  message forward for a Democratic Party that really needs to reach out to younger Americans. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=110.03999999999999s)]
*  They need to reach out to younger Americans, and they need to reach out in an authentic [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=115.72s)]
*  way. I think that what makes AOC effective is not only that she's younger, but that she [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=120.92s)]
*  comes off authentic without saying I'm trying to kick the older crowd aside, because it was very [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=128.88s)]
*  important. She did that tour with 83-year-old Bernie Sanders, while some of the younger [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=136.32s)]
*  members of Congress saying the old guard needs to retire. She's showing a balance and a maturity [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=142.72s)]
*  as a young person and a message that penetrates. And by the way, what a great message to have. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=148.56s)]
*  You've got all these Ivy League boys that are in the Trump administration that went all the, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=153.68s)]
*  no offense, Ivy League boys are anywhere. But all these guys, billionaire Ivy Leaguers, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=160.0s)]
*  attacking her, going, oh, she's an elite. It's like a bartender or a barista or whatever she was. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=168.32s)]
*  She's like, what are you talking about? I had to work my ass off to stay one step ahead of [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  creditors and debtors. I know you. And she talks as one who had to work her way against some trust [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=182.72s)]
*  fund babies that are playing blue collar workers in the White House that has no idea what it is. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=190.8s)]
*  Her authenticity makes her, I think, and I think that goes beyond ages, because like I said, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=197.12s)]
*  for her and Bernie to hook up shows the age gap really dies if you deal with people that are [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=202.72s)]
*  really speaking to the will of people. We should note though, certainly very supportive of her [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=209.04s)]
*  tour there of Senator Sanders, but her statement is that, I'll read it, it's actually clear to me [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=213.51999999999998s)]
*  that the underlying dynamics in this caucus have not shifted with respect to seniority as much as [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=217.84s)]
*  I think would be necessary. There's a dig there that the Democrats are still a little bit still [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=222.64s)]
*  stuck in the past. Now, does she need it? No, she's a huge star already. She's an immense political [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=227.6s)]
*  talent. The Democrats need her more than she needs the Democrats. Yes. It's that simple. And so she's [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=232.32000000000002s)]
*  got to be thinking, wait a second, wait, I'm going to put myself out there again just so a bunch of [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=239.36s)]
*  old members in seniority are going to like knock me down? Yeah, no, that's the thinking here is that [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=245.04000000000002s)]
*  she doesn't need it. She's a big brand. She's very talented. There's already a lot of speculation as [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=250.32000000000002s)]
*  to what her political future would be if she wants to run for something statewide in New York or even [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=255.76000000000002s)]
*  bigger down the road. But in her decision here, she makes it clear like, hey, this party still [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=259.44s)]
*  needs to change how they're doing things. Democrats don't know what to do with her because she is so [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=265.6s)]
*  exciting. She draws big crowds and yet they worry that Republicans use her successfully as a boogie [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=269.2s)]
*  woman. She's the Green New Deal. She's a leftist for New York and all that. I don't think it's either [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=274.4s)]
*  or. I think she's incredibly talented, but there's a lot of room to look at a lot of people over the [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=281.52s)]
*  coming months. And, you know, yes, of course, it's always good to appeal to young people, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=286.64s)]
*  but they are not the most dependable voters. You need someone who appeals to all people, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=292.8s)]
*  including Republicans. Well, I mean, and she and Bernie do. We talked about the fact that you have [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=297.68s)]
*  none other than Steve Bannon, who talks about AOC all the time and says, yeah, she's right on a lot [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=302.71999999999997s)]
*  of populist issues. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwJEd4-oho&t=309.91999999999996s)]
