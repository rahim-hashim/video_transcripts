# 'Not a surprise, definitely disheartening': Jonathan Capehart on Trump's Memorial Day attacks
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4)
*  here at home, President Trump marked Memorial Day by paying tribute to fallen service members [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=0.0s)]
*  at Arlington National Cemetery. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  The president continued the tradition of placing a wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldier. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=7.92s)]
*  He was joined by Vice President J.D. Vance as well as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=12.36s)]
*  Both men served in the military. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  The president then gave an address honoring the great warriors who died in service to [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=19.0s)]
*  the nation, singling out several Gold Star families to tell their stories. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=22.8s)]
*  But the president's speech at this otherwise solemn event also, of course, included some [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=27.8s)]
*  of his campaign-style rhetoric. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=33.52s)]
*  Those young men could never have known what their sacrifice would mean to us, but we certainly [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=35.56s)]
*  know what we owe to them. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=42.6s)]
*  Their valor gave us the freest, greatest, and most noble republic ever to exist on the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=45.96s)]
*  a republic that I am fixing after a long and hard four years. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=52.32s)]
*  That was a hard four years we went through. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=57.96s)]
*  Who would let that happen? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=68.8s)]
*  People pouring through our borders unchecked, people doing things that are indescribable [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=71.72s)]
*  and not for today to discuss. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=80.27999999999999s)]
*  But the republic that is now doing so very well, we're doing so very well right now. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=83.47999999999999s)]
*  Considering the circumstances and we'll do record-setting better with time, we will do [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  better than we've ever done as a nation, better than ever before. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=95.17999999999999s)]
*  I promise you that. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=98.91999999999999s)]
*  Mind you, that's the most solemn day on the calendar at perhaps the most solemn place [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=100.91999999999999s)]
*  in our nation. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=104.28s)]
*  Before his trip to Arlington National Cemetery, the president put up at all caps social media [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=105.44s)]
*  screed attacking former president Biden and calling federal judges who have blocked his [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=109.92s)]
*  mass deportation efforts, quote, monsters who want our country to go to hell. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=115.08s)]
*  Joining us now, we have co-host of MSNBC's The Weekend Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=121.88s)]
*  Jonathan Capehart. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=126.08s)]
*  Jonathan is also the author of the new memoir titled Yet Here I Am, Lessons from a Black [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=127.08s)]
*  Man's Search for Home. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=132.52s)]
*  And also with us, special correspondent at Vanity Fair and host of the Fast Politics [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=134.4s)]
*  podcast, Molly Jong Fast. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=138.16000000000003s)]
*  Thank you so much, guys, for being here. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=141.0s)]
*  Jon, I'll start with you. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=143.28s)]
*  This is sadly not surprising. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=145.56s)]
*  It almost seems like a tradition, a very self-aware tradition that on holidays, President Trump [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=149.28s)]
*  takes social media and puts out an all-caps message to the haters and the losers, as he [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=153.32000000000002s)]
*  sometimes explicitly says. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=158.04000000000002s)]
*  And now in this time, though, to even go to Arlington and to, you know, in such a solemn [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=160.32000000000002s)]
*  day, such an important place, a place that I urge everyone to visit at some point in [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=165.08s)]
*  their lives and to make these sort of campaign-style attacks, not a surprise, but still disheartening. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=168.48000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=174.28s)]
*  Not a surprise. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=175.28s)]
*  Definitely disheartening. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=176.28s)]
*  But this is something he has been doing since he was president the first time. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  Remember, I think it was just after inauguration in 2017. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=182.32000000000002s)]
*  He went to the headquarters of the CIA, stood in front of the wall of the fallen, no one [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=185.96s)]
*  knows who they are, the stars, and gave a campaign-style speech. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=192.04s)]
*  And folks were aghast. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=196.52s)]
*  And here we are, you know, years later, and he is, as you said, at Arlington National [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=198.2s)]
*  Cemetery, a place where there shouldn't be politics. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=202.84s)]
*  The people in those graves, they were Democrats, they were Republicans, they were independents. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=207.02s)]
*  Maybe they weren't part of a party at all. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=211.8s)]
*  Maybe they joined the service in service of their country and gave their lives as a result [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=213.72s)]
*  of it. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=219.54s)]
*  Politics should have no place there. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=220.57999999999998s)]
*  And yet the president of the United States, this president of the United States, can't [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=222.42s)]
*  seem to help himself. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=226.7s)]
*  Jonathan, you have written this book, Yet Here I Am, and in it you talk about sort of what [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=228.42s)]
*  it was like to grow up and be sort of, and be a kind of, you know, be able to be who [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=235.34s)]
*  you are. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=244.04s)]
*  I wonder if you could talk about that, what that was like and what your experience right [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=245.04s)]
*  writing this book has been like. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=250.5s)]
*  Well, one of the things I tried to get across is, you know, what it's like to be the only [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=252.14s)]
*  black kid in a predominantly white school, or the only black kid in your all-white friend [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=258.72s)]
*  group, and how I learned to navigate issues of race even then. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=265.82s)]
*  Of course, I didn't understand it until I was sitting and writing this book. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=271.86s)]
*  And what did it mean? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=275.14s)]
*  There I learned sort of how to be black in white spaces and understanding that, you know, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=277.22s)]
*  my blackness isn't, it doesn't matter what I think of myself. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=285.02000000000004s)]
*  I know I am black. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=289.46000000000004s)]
*  But my blackness is judged in the eye of whoever is looking at me. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=292.1s)]
*  So in some instances I could be too black. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=297.5s)]
*  In other instances, someone else, I could be not black enough. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=300.16s)]
*  In other instances, I could be, or the desire is for me not to be black at all. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=303.52s)]
*  And I write about a thing that happened where I violated the unspoken unwritten rule, which [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=309.08s)]
*  was I was not supposed to acknowledge the fact that I was black in this friend group. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=314.96s)]
*  I don't want to give it away. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=321.08s)]
*  But you know, writing this book was fun. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=322.79999999999995s)]
*  In some ways it was cathartic. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=329.9s)]
*  In other ways it was wonderful to be able to sit back and reflect on, okay, what have [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=332.12s)]
*  I been through? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=338.22s)]
*  What does it mean? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=339.22s)]
*  And how can the stories I tell in the book help other people? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=340.22s)]
*  Yeah, more on the beautiful story. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=343.6s)]
*  We're more on the book in a moment. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=345.04s)]
*  A little more on politics now. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=346.48s)]
*  Former U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Rahm Emanuel, is weighing in on the Democratic Party, calling [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=348.16s)]
*  its brand toxic, weak, and woke. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=353.12s)]
*  Emanuel told the Wall Street Journal that Democrats need to pivot back to the center [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=356.48s)]
*  if they want to win elections once again, and that the party has put too much focus [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=360.28000000000003s)]
*  on the so-called culture war issues that are favored by progressives. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=364.26s)]
*  Emanuel, of course, served in both the Biden and Obama administrations and was mayor of [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=368.44s)]
*  Chicago. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=372.68s)]
*  Now he appears to be considering his own presidential bid, or perhaps a possible run for governor [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=373.8s)]
*  of Illinois. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=378.94s)]
*  Mika Yaram Emanuel, someone who is certainly no stranger to democratic politics, but putting [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=379.94s)]
*  himself noticeably front and center since Election Day. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=384.2s)]
*  Clearly, if not a candidate, at least wants to be a real voice going forward. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=388.96s)]
*  I think so. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=394.76s)]
*  It'll be interesting. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=395.76s)]
*  I think he really punches through when he's talking politics and talking about what the [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=396.76s)]
*  Democrats need to do. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=401.36s)]
*  We'll have to see how this plays moving forward. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=402.52s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Democratic Party is still searching for a path forward. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=406.2s)]
*  More than six months after President Trump swept the battleground states and won the [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=411.28s)]
*  2024 election, a new piece from the New York Times analyzes the gradual split between the [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=415.96s)]
*  party and its traditional base, noting, quote, communities that Democrats had come to count [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=421.82s)]
*  on for a generation or more. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=428.47999999999996s)]
*  Young people, black voters, Latinos, all veered toward the right in 2024, some of them sharply. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=431.08s)]
*  But as the paper points out, even the attempts from the party to address these issues seem [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=439.8s)]
*  out of touch. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=445.1s)]
*  Quote, democratic donors and strategists have been gathering at luxury hotels to discuss [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=446.1s)]
*  how to win back working class voters commissioning new projects that can read like anthropological [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=452.04s)]
*  studies of people from far away places. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=457.90000000000003s)]
*  The prospectus for one new $20 million effort obtained by the Times aims to reverse the [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=461.96000000000004s)]
*  erosion of Democratic support among young men, especially online. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=468.54s)]
*  It is code named SAM, short for Speaking with American Men, a strategic plan, and promises [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=474.52000000000004s)]
*  investments to study the syntax, language and content that gains attention and virality [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=482.28000000000003s)]
*  in these spaces. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=489.48s)]
*  It recommends buying advertisements and video games, among other things. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=490.96000000000004s)]
*  And Jonathan, Sam, I am. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=495.66s)]
*  Can't help myself. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=498.72s)]
*  But I really, I just can't help myself. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=499.72s)]
*  But I think the investment needs to be in American men and in young men, you know, and [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=502.72s)]

*  I think somehow along the way, men got left behind, and especially in the way this party [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=512.52s)]
*  speaks, but also what it does. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=520.08s)]
*  And men are really struggling, especially young men. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=522.92s)]
*  In fact, there's a lot of women, young women that I talk to that there's no one to date [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=525.8s)]
*  out there. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=529.9599999999999s)]
*  Are they all playing video? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=530.9599999999999s)]
*  What are they doing? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=532.04s)]
*  I'm not criticizing them. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=533.04s)]
*  They need help. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=534.5s)]
*  They need support. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=535.5s)]
*  They need to feel like they belong in this country and they have a real role. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=536.78s)]
*  As soon as they realized they could do an acronym of SAM, they should have thrown the [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=541.5999999999999s)]
*  whole thing out. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=544.54s)]
*  This was just an ill-fated study, though important, some important lessons that certainly the [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=546.3199999999999s)]
*  to all sorts of voters, including young men who we did see last year break towards President [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=551.98s)]
*  Trump in a way that was unexpected. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=557.22s)]
*  They felt more comfortable in the politics of the right, the politics of, I don't know [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=559.02s)]
*  if I'd call it conservatism, but at least in mago world. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=562.54s)]
*  So that is a real issue. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=565.9s)]
*  And Mika, you, of course, raise even bigger societal concerns just about the fate of young [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=566.9s)]
*  men right now in the year of 2025. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=571.1800000000001s)]
*  Well, Jonathan, if I could, it's investing in them instead of advertising on video games [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=573.1s)]
*  How about let's try and inspire them not to be on video games and be out in the world [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=581.0400000000001s)]
*  connecting with people and working on themselves. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=586.44s)]
*  And it's not their fault. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=590.08s)]
*  I'm not criticizing, but this is just sounds very surface, a very expensive effort to just [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=591.08s)]
*  barely address the surface of the problem. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=598.24s)]
*  Could not agree more. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=601.2800000000001s)]
*  There needs to be more more focus paid to the root causes, not this right now. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=602.2800000000001s)]
*  These are societal issues. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjW0JHPKiA4&t=606.44s)]
