# Five years after George Floyd: National Urban leagues asks was it a movement or moment?
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps)
*  Mayor, this Sunday marks five years since the murder of George Floyd. Floyd's story, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=0.0s)]
*  of course, shook the nation, setting off a massive wave of protests and calls for a racial justice [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=5.36s)]
*  reckoning across the country. But now that some time has passed, a new report from the National [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Urban League is asking, was it a moment or a movement? Mayor Morial, this is from the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=16.8s)]
*  organization that you, of course, lead. What did you find out? Five steps forward and three steps [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=22.32s)]
*  back. Significant commitments, powerful commitments on racial justice by institutions, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=28.56s)]
*  corporations, foundations, universities. Today, many are retreating, but there are many who are [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=35.12s)]
*  maintaining their commitments. Those that maintain their commitments don't get the headlines. Those [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=43.12s)]
*  that back off do. Many who have backed off have done it by quietly saying, I feel intimidated by [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  the new administration, and this is why I'm doing it. Not that the commitments are not meritorious. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=56.88s)]
*  So I'm disappointed and somewhat shaken by the idea that these commitments, so significant and [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=62.24s)]
*  so powerful, were made, and now too many are backing off. On the police side, there were [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=70.4s)]
*  significant advances, mainly because of the Justice Department, the Division of Civil Rights [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=77.36s)]
*  led by Kristen Clark. 180 officers convicted, numerous, dozens of police departments either [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=83.36s)]
*  under pattern and practice investigations. The push also led to states like Maryland, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=90.16s)]
*  many, many cities and police departments on their own, making significant changes. Once again, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=95.92s)]
*  the roadblock now is that this new Justice Department has said, we're going to drop our [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=101.52s)]
*  commitment, we're going to freeze these investigations, and we're going to walk away [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=106.88s)]
*  from the existing consent decrees. I want to say this, a call out to the leadership of both [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=111.36s)]
*  Minneapolis and Louisville. No matter what the Justice Department says, we're going to hold them [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=117.28s)]
*  accountable to continue the commitments of the consent decree on a voluntary basis, and this is [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=122.4s)]
*  what they need to do, notwithstanding anything DOJ does. Mark, that pattern of five steps forward, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=128.8s)]
*  three steps back is something we have seen throughout American history, certainly as far [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=136.0s)]
*  as African Americans are concerned. Five steps forward, three steps back. Is this time different? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=142.72s)]
*  Is this time because of the comprehensive attack on the very idea of diversity, the very idea of [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=151.6s)]
*  inclusion? Is it so strong from this administration? Is there a chance that the pattern is different [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=159.92s)]
*  this time and that the number of steps back is more than three, that we go back four steps, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=171.44s)]
*  we go back five steps, six steps? Can things actually get worse on a net basis because of [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=177.44s)]
*  this administration's hostility to the very idea of racial justice? Jane, you are absolutely right. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=185.44s)]
*  That's the risk, that it's five steps forward and eight, nine, ten steps backward. What's different [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=193.04s)]
*  in this instance is that this movement, this anti-civil rights movement, this attack on, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=199.92s)]
*  I'll call it, the advances of the 20th century, the progress that we've made on a number of steps, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=206.16s)]
*  is being animated, cheerleaded, and led by the 47th president of the United States. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=211.6s)]
*  My mother, my wonderful great late mother told me, I've seen Donald Trump before, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=218.24s)]
*  but he wasn't the president. He was a sheriff in Louisiana. He was a city council person in a small [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=222.95999999999998s)]
*  town. I've seen him before, but not with this level of influence and power. So the first 100 [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=230.0s)]
*  days of the administration certainly brought this ferocious force against this progress, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=238.0s)]
*  but it also has brought a gene of resistance movement, hundreds of lawsuits, protests. That [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=243.04s)]
*  resistance movement, I would say, is only in its earliest of stages because the movement is touching [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=248.4s)]
*  people across the board. Just recently, a federal court is reinstating the Department of Education, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=254.88s)]
*  reinstating the MBDA, saying that if you're going to eliminate those agencies, there's a process. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=261.36s)]
*  You can't do it unilaterally. You can't do it by executive action. So this is going to be a [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=267.28s)]
*  continuing fight for the future, for the soul, for the vision for the 21st century America. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=271.91999999999996s)]
*  Such important words there. President and CEO of the National Urban League, Mark Morial. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=279.35999999999996s)]
*  Mark, Mr. Mayor, thank you for joining us. Thank you for having me. Good. Really appreciate it. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=283.44s)]
*  Go Knicks. There we go. Yeah, there it is. There it is. There hasn't been much Knicks enthusiasm [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=285.76s)]
*  this time. A lot of worry. Don't give up one game. That is a seven game series. Don't give up. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=290.47999999999996s)]
*  We will be watching tonight. Next up here, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h7wFjCq5Ps&t=295.03999999999996s)]
