# ‘Completely unnecessary’: LA Mayor says ‘there is no need’ for National Guard in city
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI)
*  I'm not going to analysis on whether Gavin Newsom should be arrested, but he ought to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=0.0s)]
*  be tart and feathered, I'll say that. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=4.64s)]
*  I mean, look, he's standing in the way of the administration and the carrying out of [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=6.0s)]
*  federal law. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=11.92s)]
*  That was Speaker Mike Johnson on whether he thought California Governor Gavin Newsom should [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=12.92s)]
*  face legal consequences, as President Trump has suggested. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=18.2s)]
*  Meanwhile, hundreds of U.S. Marines are scheduled to hit the streets of Los Angeles today, drawing [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=22.56s)]
*  the thousands of National Guard troops already deployed to the city by President Trump, all [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=27.52s)]
*  against the will of city and state leaders. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=33.0s)]
*  California Governor Newsom saying yesterday that the move was meant to incite more violence [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=35.68s)]
*  and not end it. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  Joining us now, Democratic Mayor of Los Angeles, Karen Bass. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=43.96s)]
*  Mayor Bass, thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=48.16s)]
*  We'll get to the federal military presence in a moment, but first, can you just provide [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=50.68s)]
*  a quick update as to things there in your city? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=55.48s)]
*  As the sun is now up in Los Angeles, how did last night go? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=59.4s)]
*  Do you think the curfew was effective? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=62.839999999999996s)]
*  I do think the curfew was effective. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=66.2s)]
*  We did have arrests, but the majority of the arrests were for unlawful assembly are violating [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=68.08s)]
*  the curfew. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=73.2s)]
*  There was no looting. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=74.2s)]
*  There was no vandalism last night. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=75.32s)]
*  So I do think that that has helped. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=77.08s)]
*  I do hope that people understand that this is a relatively small slice of Los Angeles, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=80.08s)]
*  a city with 500 square miles, and this is about two square miles of our downtown area. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=85.84s)]
*  So it'll be interesting to see what happens today. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=93.8s)]
*  But understand that the real thing that's happening here are the egregious ICE raids. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=96.12s)]
*  And we don't know when or where that's going to happen. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=102.44s)]
*  And I do think that that will be a test as to where the city goes today in the next couple [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=105.66s)]
*  of days. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=111.42s)]
*  So Mayor Bass, let's talk about now. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=112.42s)]
*  We have National Guard, thousands of National Guard members there, Marines also in the area. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=114.3s)]
*  Simile going to be walking the streets of Los Angeles today, safeguarding federal buildings, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=119.02s)]
*  unclear what else their mission might be. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=124.17999999999999s)]
*  What is your reaction to that? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=127.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=129.3s)]
*  Well, my reaction is, is that it is completely unnecessary. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=130.3s)]
*  What are they going to do? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=134.14s)]
*  The 100 National Guard soldiers that are downtown Los Angeles are guarding one federal building. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=135.95999999999998s)]
*  So there is no need for this. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=143.14s)]
*  The city handled things perfectly last night and will continue to do this. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=145.5s)]
*  I do believe, though, that this is all part of an experiment that's taking place in Los [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=149.45999999999998s)]
*  Angeles. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=153.73999999999998s)]
*  And I hope other cities was—I know they are, because I was on line with about 50 other [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=154.73999999999998s)]
*  concerned about what's happening in our city because it could easily come to theirs. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=161.22s)]
*  And the test is what happens when the federal government intervenes and takes power away [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=165.42s)]
*  from a governor and a mayor? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=170.78s)]
*  So yeah, I was going to ask you that. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=172.94s)]
*  What experiment is this, do you think? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=174.4s)]
*  What is President Trump trying to test here? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=176.74s)]
*  What do you believe? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=179.98s)]
*  Do you agree as to what his goals are? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=181.98s)]
*  Do you agree with—and do you agree with the governor in which this is only going to [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=184.06s)]
*  make things worse? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=187.26s)]
*  Well, I absolutely agree with the governor that it's not only going to make things worse. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=189.26s)]
*  It has made things worse. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=194.89999999999998s)]
*  And in terms of do I agree with the president's goals, who knows what the president's goals [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=196.85999999999999s)]
*  are? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=201.06s)]
*  I mean, originally it was we're going to go after violent felons, gang members, drug [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=202.06s)]
*  dealers, and we have people being chased in parking lots of Home Depot. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=207.22s)]
*  There was a man who was arrested. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=211.7s)]
*  He was a customer at a car wash. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=213.42s)]
*  He was taken in, and his son was left to essentially care for the family. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=216.01999999999998s)]
*  We had ICE officers go by my grandson's elementary school and toward what purpose? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=221.28s)]
*  Fortunately, the principal did not allow them in. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=228.29999999999998s)]
*  But these kind of things just create a sense of terror and fear and uncertainty and insecurity [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=231.06s)]
*  in the city, and we are a city of immigrants. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=237.57999999999998s)]
*  We have entire industries that wouldn't even be able to function without immigrant labor. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=240.85999999999999s)]
*  So this is terrible to families, but it also is a very powerful blow to the local economy [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=245.94s)]
*  if this is going to continue. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=252.96s)]
*  Mayor, have you received any kind of communication from the federal government about, or even [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=254.9s)]
*  the state government, about what you can expect from the hundreds of Marines who are in Los [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=262.1s)]
*  Angeles right now and what their mission is? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=268.74s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=271.58s)]
*  I don't think the governor has any idea. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=273.58s)]
*  I mean, which is the point? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=275.86s)]
*  You know, on Saturday night, the president tweeted that because of the great work of [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=277.9s)]
*  the National Guard, the protests and the violence was curtailed. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=283.38s)]
*  The National Guard wasn't even here. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=288.3s)]
*  They didn't even arrive until the next day. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=290.21999999999997s)]
*  So that's why it's very hard not to see this as a stunt or as a test case, because there [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=292.52s)]
*  isn't anything happening here. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=297.53999999999996s)]
*  Thursday before the first raid took place, the city was peaceful. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=299.42s)]
*  Nothing was going on. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=303.34s)]
*  When the raid happened, that's when people were just outraged at the way the raid happened. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=304.68s)]
*  And then, of course, the arrest of one of the most respected labor leaders in our city. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=310.48s)]
*  Mayor, you know, we're getting cherry-picked images from the Trump administration, a sense [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=316.04s)]
*  of that there's chaos in Los Angeles. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=321.8s)]
*  Can you actually talk to us about what has driven most Angelenos into the streets and [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=324.08s)]
*  how this movement of people who are peacefully protesting largely feels on the ground? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=329.64s)]
*  Well, again, we are a city of 3.8 million, 500 square miles. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=336.44s)]
*  This is happening over about five or six streets in downtown Los Angeles. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=342.52s)]
*  The curfew that we put in place last night covers about two square miles of our city. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=347.68s)]
*  That is a picture of chaos. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=353.76s)]
*  I'm sorry, but that's just not true. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=356.03999999999996s)]
*  Just like it wasn't true that the National Guard saved the day before they even got here. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=358.64s)]
*  So, Mayor Vass, we had Tom Homan on the show earlier this week and the borders are—and [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=364.71999999999997s)]
*  he told us that the original ICE raids were to pick up individuals. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=370.68s)]
*  He said they had lengthy criminal records. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=374.4s)]
*  He detailed some of them. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=375.91999999999996s)]
*  So my response—my question to you is a two-part of one. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=378.15999999999997s)]
*  Has he presented any evidence to you that indeed they picked up individuals with violent [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=381.03999999999996s)]
*  criminal records? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=385.64s)]
*  And secondly, are you concerned at all that there are people out there who say, well, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=386.88s)]
*  the city of Los Angeles is harboring dangerous individuals? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=391.59999999999997s)]
*  You know, no. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=396.96s)]
*  I think that that is fiction. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=397.96s)]
*  Are there dangerous individuals that are here in Los Angeles? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=399.82s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=402.56s)]
*  Are we harboring them? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=403.56s)]
*  No. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=404.56s)]
*  I think that the idea that what is going on here is chaos and we need federal intervention [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=405.56s)]
*  is just not accurate. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=412.52s)]
*  It doesn't paint an accurate picture of what's going on here at all. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=414.88s)]
*  And really, what is going to help would be an end to the raids. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=418.71999999999997s)]
*  For a city not to know when, where, how, or why raids take place, you can imagine that [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=424.2s)]
*  the entire population of immigrants is very unsettling. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=430.03999999999996s)]
*  I also have to tell you an example of people who went to their annual appointments. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=434.2s)]
*  You know, they're here legally. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=440.12s)]
*  They have papers. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=441.2s)]
*  And I've been told by people who go to check in with the immigration office once a year, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=442.28s)]
*  even they've been detained. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=446.36s)]
*  So I don't think that there is a crisis here that is happening at all, except for one [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=448.36s)]
*  manufactured by Washington. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=453.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=455.64s)]
*  Certainly there have been reports of those types of arrests at those centers, as well [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=456.64s)]
*  as near schools, you know, of students. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=459.64s)]
*  And lastly, Madame, before you go, just what is your message then to your city and to those [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=462.03999999999996s)]
*  of us watching from elsewhere in the country about what you hope happens these next couple [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0Ikl7buoI&t=467.48s)]
