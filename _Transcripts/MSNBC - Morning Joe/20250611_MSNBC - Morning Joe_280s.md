# 'Just plain weird': Tulsi Gabbard warns of a 'nuclear holocaust' in a new social media video
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0)
*  It's just before the top of the hour, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard posted [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=0.0s)]
*  a bleak video on social media warning of a nuclear holocaust. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  The three-minute video includes imagery of atomic blasts and simulations of American [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  cities and landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge being destroyed. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=18.86s)]
*  Gabbard blames the political elite for pushing the world's superpowers into a global war. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=25.38s)]
*  This isn't some made-up science fiction story. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=33.78s)]
*  This is the reality of what's at stake, what we are facing now. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=37.3s)]
*  Because as we stand here today, closer to the brink of nuclear annihilation than ever [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=41.78s)]
*  before, political elite and warmongers are carelessly fomenting fear and tensions between [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=46.58s)]
*  nuclear powers. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=52.68s)]
*  Perhaps it's because they are confident that they will have access to nuclear shelters [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=55.18s)]
*  for themselves and for their families that regular people won't have access to. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=59.54s)]
*  Jonathan Lemire, what's the back story here? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=66.46s)]
*  So she went to Hiroshima recently, and that's what she says is why she's posting this. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=70.66s)]
*  But in most ways she's accused of parroting Russian talking points here, that it has been [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=75.46000000000001s)]
*  from the Kremlin throughout the conflict in Ukraine, that the West, that the U.S., that [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=79.74000000000001s)]
*  NATO is trying to push Russia by punishing it for invading Ukraine, therefore putting [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=83.86s)]
*  the world on the brink of an atomic conflict. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=89.66s)]
*  That is what she's saying here, that she's afraid that the, quote, elites want this war. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=92.3s)]
*  And she's a warning to the U.S. and the West to not punish Russia for not agreeing to a [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=98.14s)]
*  Ukrainian ceasefire, because if Russia is punished, they might have to lash out, and [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=104.18s)]
*  we may head up towards the apocalypse. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=108.62s)]
*  Senator John Kennedy, a Republican, said yesterday when shown this video that he thinks [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=111.5s)]
*  that Gabbard should, quote, change her meds, Cady Kay. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=115.86s)]
*  So she's getting some pushback from Republicans, members of her own party, well, she was a [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=119.34s)]
*  Democrat, but members of the Trump, those who are normally supportive of the Trump administration. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=124.5s)]
*  And beyond the obvious Kremlin sort of shadow here, it's just plain weird. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=129.14s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty weird and very ominous. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=135.5s)]
*  It went out to three and a half million followers. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=137.46s)]
*  I mean, I think I would add, is this the best use of the DNI's time? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=139.73999999999998s)]
*  It's very well produced. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=144.17999999999998s)]
*  I mean, we do television. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=145.78s)]
*  This is like a kind of mini documentary. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=146.78s)]
*  But there's something about this kind of anti-elite, you know, we heard it in the attacks on top [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=148.89999999999998s)]
*  universities that comes from the kind of populist strain of the Republican Party at the moment, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=152.94s)]
*  or at least of the White House at the moment. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=158.54s)]
*  And there's something even stranger, which is this idea that there is some kind of secret [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=160.89999999999998s)]
*  cabal that is behind the scenes pulling the strings. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=164.7s)]
*  And yet we have Donald Trump in the White House. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=168.85999999999999s)]
*  Is she suggesting that even though Donald Trump is president at the moment, there's [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=170.7s)]
*  still actually this kind of group of secret elites that's running things? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=174.45999999999998s)]
*  I mean, that doesn't seem to add up. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=179.06s)]
*  So the whole thing is pretty weird. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=180.78s)]
*  I agree with the senator. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=182.42s)]
*  It's kind of odd. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=183.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=184.42s)]
*  Mike raises the question, is this just something she's freelancing on? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=185.42s)]
*  Is this coming from the United States government? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=188.01999999999998s)]
*  Her office was asked by a few media outlets and said, Donald Trump shares this view too, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=189.85999999999999s)]
*  which as John points out, is exactly the view of Vladimir Putin, which is, don't support [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=194.38s)]
*  Ukraine too much. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=199.82s)]
*  We're only going to escalate this war. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=200.82s)]
*  Give us everything we need here. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=202.34s)]
*  But this is, you know, a three and a half minute video from the director of national [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=203.54s)]
*  intelligence. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=208.57999999999998s)]
*  Ominous is a friendly word. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=209.57999999999998s)]
*  I think bizarre is more like it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=212.78s)]
*  Repeat that again. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=214.82s)]
*  She's the director of national intelligence. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=215.82s)]
*  These people have jobs that they ought not to have. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=218.85999999999999s)]
*  You wonder, to your point, to your point that you raised, did she bounce this off the president? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=221.84s)]
*  Did she show it to him and say, what do you think? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=226.68s)]
*  And he said, go for it. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=228.16s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=230.08s)]
*  I mean, the series of appointments in this administration is something that we gloss [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=231.08s)]
*  over day after day after day. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=234.94s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard, the most dangerous, I would submit, is Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and what [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=237.48000000000002s)]
*  he's doing to the health of this country or the lack of health potentially for your children [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=242.2s)]
*  who need vaccines, things like that. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=246.64000000000001s)]
*  All of it is just part of a parade of incompetence, just visible incompetence. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=248.92s)]
*  You just saw part of it right there, right now. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=255.28s)]
*  It's a director of national intelligence. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlapX-PTAI0&t=257.88s)]
