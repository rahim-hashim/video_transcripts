# 'Lowest of the low-hanging fruit': Eugene Robinson on why trade deal 'doesn't change a lot'
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA)
*  Yesterday, President Trump announced the framework of a trade deal with the United Kingdom. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=0.0s)]
*  The agreement is going to lower tariff on cars from the UK from 27.5% to 10%, while [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=4.78s)]
*  tariffs on UK steel and aluminum will be dropped completely. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=11.98s)]
*  But the White House says the baseline 10% tariff on all UK imports will stay in place. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=15.9s)]
*  Meanwhile, the UK is removing taxes for American companies to sell beef, poultry and ethanol. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=21.22s)]
*  It's still not clear when the deal is going to be finalized. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=26.74s)]
*  As the New York Times reports, the British government is still pushing to bring down [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=29.7s)]
*  the 10% tariff on most other goods. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=32.86s)]
*  And American officials want Britain to reconsider tax on technology companies. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=35.48s)]
*  Officials though from both governments are going to need to meet in the coming months [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=40.26s)]
*  to hammer out more specific language, leaving open the potential for disagreements. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=43.959999999999994s)]
*  But Gene Robinson, there are a lot of people that are complaining that this is symbolic. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=50.86s)]
*  Civilism obviously very important. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=60.78s)]
*  It's also the fact that there is a good relationship between Keir Starmer and the American president [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=64.06s)]
*  certainly helped this move forward. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=69.36s)]
*  Certainly seemed to calm the markets a little bit yesterday. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=71.94s)]
*  But there are a lot more deals that need to be done before again those that are concerned [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=75.68s)]
*  about our economy cratering into a recession, before those concerns are eased even more. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=82.08000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, this seems to me to be absolutely the lowest of the low-hanging fruit that was out [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=87.88000000000001s)]
*  there. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=92.4s)]
*  You know, there's no huge trade imbalance between the US and Britain. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=93.4s)]
*  It's not as if the UK runs some sort of big trade surplus with the United States in some [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=100.22s)]
*  measures that's the other way around. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=107.34s)]
*  I didn't see a lot in this about the areas in which that are sort of more important to [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=109.06s)]
*  economies where the US and the UK actually compete. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=117.06s)]
*  I mean in financial services, for example, the City of London versus Wall Street in tech. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=120.82s)]
*  Britain is probably the, you know, after the US and China, arguably Britain would be [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=129.42s)]
*  further along in AI than any other country. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=137.85999999999999s)]
*  A lot of Google's deep mind started there. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=141.7s)]
*  And I know that the UK is very interested in a sort of more cooperative relationship [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=147.17999999999998s)]
*  going forward, especially in tech. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=154.22s)]
*  So we'll see how this evolves, but this is not like actually like a trade deal. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=157.9s)]
*  It's a framework that doesn't change a lot, in my opinion. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=165.22s)]
*  Yeah, that's certainly a popular sentiment. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=168.06s)]
*  Yeah, it matters, but it is just a small piece of this, and there's a long way to go considering [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=170.3s)]
*  that the trade relationships the US still needs to establish with places like Canada, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=175.78s)]
*  Mexico, China in particular. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=179.74s)]
*  And David Rode, I know you think that this is a bit of a distraction. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=181.62s)]
*  We say a lot on the show, and it's true. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=185.58s)]
*  I'm born out his first term and again this term when President Trump wants to talk about [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=186.98000000000002s)]
*  something else, usually his reflexes to go to immigration. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=191.10000000000002s)]
*  But to these days, because his tariffs and the trade war he has started have so dominated [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=193.66000000000003s)]
*  this term, this administration right now, we've seen the markets react, we've seen [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=201.62s)]
*  the economic worries and the like. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=205.5s)]
*  White House aides told me last week they were really eager to get some sort of deal done. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=207.82000000000002s)]
*  They have one now. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=211.34s)]
*  But you argue this is actually distracting. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=212.5s)]
*  Like, hey, look at this. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=214.82s)]
*  I mean, because they're not addressing a lot of the other global crises, including what [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=216.61999999999998s)]
*  we're seeing overseas, India, Pakistan and the rest. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=221.38s)]
*  Yes, so he has changed the narrative again and he's very successful at that. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=224.22s)]
*  But in terms of his foreign policy achievements, peace in Ukraine, first days in office, that [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=228.98s)]
*  hasn't happened. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=234.77999999999997s)]
*  Gaza, there's been no solution there and a worsening humanitarian situation there. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=235.77999999999997s)]
*  And then these key negotiations with Iran. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=241.7s)]
*  So he has his first international trip next week. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=243.98s)]
*  He's going to go to Saudi Arabia and other parts of the Middle East. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=246.38s)]
*  He hasn't really achieved much in terms of his broad foreign policy, anything at all. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=249.9s)]
*  And what we're hearing is that the Ukraine talks have stalled. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=255.26s)]
*  Putin might not be willing to compromise at all. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=259.65999999999997s)]
*  It's very unclear what's going to happen in Gaza. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=261.98s)]
*  And the talks with Iran are really important. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=263.82s)]
*  Our colleague Courtney QB reported that this bombing campaign against the Houthis, last [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=266.12s)]
*  week Trump declared victory and said they had capitulated. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=270.22s)]
*  They haven't capitulated. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=273.46000000000004s)]
*  They're still saying they're going to attack Israel. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=275.26000000000005s)]
*  And most of all, in the seven weeks of the bombing campaign, it has cost hundreds of [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=278.34000000000003s)]
*  millions of dollars, possibly a billion dollars. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=282.70000000000005s)]
*  So these are all struggles in terms of the foreign policy front. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=285.86s)]
*  In many ways, he's stuck in this same sort of quagmire that the Biden administration [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=289.06s)]
*  struggled with also, and he hasn't been able to shift away from that. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31eU4eQHbvA&t=293.98s)]
