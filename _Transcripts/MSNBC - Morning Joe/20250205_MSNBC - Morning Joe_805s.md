# Why Trump's Gaza talk 'flies in the face of how Trump views foreign policy'
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok)
*  We're going to start this morning with President Trump's brazen proposal for Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=0.0s)]
*  Yesterday, the president announced the United States should seek control of the enclave [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  and that the nearly two million Palestinians living there should relocate to Egypt or Jordan, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=11.08s)]
*  a move both countries have vehemently opposed. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  The president made the comment during a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=21.28s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  The two leaders met at the White House yesterday and it comes as negotiators are discussing [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=27.279999999999998s)]
*  the next phase of the Israel Hamas ceasefire agreement, which is supposed to include more [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=32.16s)]
*  humanitarian aid and reconstruction supplies for the people of Gaza. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=38.32s)]
*  We should go to other countries of interest with humanitarian hearts and there are many [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=44.12s)]
*  of them that want to do this and build various domains that will ultimately be occupied by [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  the 1.8 million Palestinians living in Gaza, ending the death and destruction and frankly [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=55.44s)]
*  bad luck. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=62.08s)]
*  This could be paid for by neighboring countries of great wealth. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=64.0s)]
*  It could be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=67.52s)]
*  It could be numerous sites or it could be one large site, but the people will be able [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=72.2s)]
*  to live in comfort and peace. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=76.75999999999999s)]
*  The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=81.04s)]
*  We'll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=85.84s)]
*  other weapons on the site, level the site and get rid of the destroyed buildings, level [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=91.52s)]
*  it out, create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=97.88s)]
*  housing for the people of the area. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=103.44s)]
*  I envision world people living there, the world's people. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=107.76s)]
*  I think you'll make that into an international, unbelievable place. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=113.0s)]
*  I think the potential in the Gaza Strip is unbelievable and I think the entire world, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=118.03999999999999s)]
*  representatives from all over the world will be there and they'll live there. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=123.56s)]
*  Palestinians also, Palestinians will live there, many people will live there. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=128.12s)]
*  We have an opportunity to do something that could be phenomenal and I don't want to be [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=133.12s)]
*  cute, I don't want to be a wise guy, but the Riviera of the Middle East, this could be [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=139.0s)]
*  something that could be so magnificent. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=143.08s)]
*  Trump's comments have sent shockwaves throughout the region and here at home. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=150.44s)]
*  In Saudi Arabia, the country's Foreign Affairs Ministry said its stance on the establishment [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=155.12s)]
*  of a Palestinian state remains a firm, unwavering position. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=161.04000000000002s)]
*  Hamas released a statement rejecting Trump's plans, calling his comments a recipe for creating [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  chaos and tension in the region. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=171.88s)]
*  Meanwhile, NBC News caught up with several senators yesterday to ask them about what [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=175.36s)]
*  the president said. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=180.4s)]
*  At first I heard of it, I said, it seems like there's a few kinks in that slinky, we'll [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=181.4s)]
*  see what he meant. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=186.96s)]
*  What do you mean by kinks in that slinky? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=187.96s)]
*  I don't know if you know about a slinky, but if it kinks you can't use it anymore. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=189.96s)]
*  I don't know how it would play out if what he said or what you all have said, I haven't [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  seen the first hand account, but obviously that's not going to happen. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=199.72s)]
*  I think that'd be a tough place to be assigned if you're an American soldier. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=204.96s)]
*  We'll see what the Arab world says, but you know, that'd be problematic at many, many [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=209.28s)]
*  levels. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=214.76000000000002s)]
*  I'm speechless, that's insane. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=217.44s)]
*  I can't think of a place on earth that would welcome American troops less and where any [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=220.52s)]
*  positive outcome is less likely and why on earth we would abandon decades of well established [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=226.88s)]
*  humanitarian programs around the world and now launch into one of the world's greatest [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=233.76s)]
*  humanitarian challenges. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=239.12s)]
*  I mean A, we don't, yes, the United States should not take anybody's home. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=241.84s)]
*  Number two, us nation building in the Middle East, if you haven't learned anything from [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=248.6s)]
*  2001 to 2025, you haven't been paying attention. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=254.96s)]
*  We are very bad at that. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=259.04s)]
*  All right, some bipartisan condemnation there. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=262.04s)]
*  Jonathan Lemire, your latest reporting for the Atlantic references Senator Graham's response. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=264.8s)]
*  He's entitled Trump's wild plan for Gaza and you write in part this, any direct US intervention [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=270.32s)]
*  in Gaza would fly in the face of Trump's longstanding desire to disengage from foreign entanglements. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=276.55999999999995s)]
*  He began negotiations to withdraw US forces from Afghanistan, wants to slash aid to Ukraine [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=283.08s)]
*  and has threatened to abandon military positions in Korea, Europe and Syria. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=289.67999999999995s)]
*  And it may face pushback at home from some usually reliable allies. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=294.28s)]
*  I think that would be an interesting proposal. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=299.52s)]
*  Senator Lindsey Graham told reporters on Capitol Hill after Trump spoke. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=301.56s)]
*  We'll see what our Arab friends say about that. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=305.32s)]
*  I think most South Carolinians would probably not be excited about sending Americans to [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=307.56s)]
*  take over Gaza. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=313.08s)]
*  It might be problematic. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=314.91999999999996s)]
*  And Jonathan Lemire, Tom Telles, I think had the quote of the day, a few kinks in the slinky. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=316.52s)]
*  Yeah, that's a new one. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=323.79999999999995s)]
*  I'm not aware of that particular phrase, but it does it, but it works. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=325.12s)]
*  We'll run with it this morning. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=329.0s)]
*  But yeah, it is a breathtakingly audacious proposal here from Donald Trump, one that [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=330.0s)]
*  was indeed met with a lot of pushback immediately. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=335.72s)]
*  First, as noted, this flies in the face of how Trump views foreign policy. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=338.44s)]
*  He wants to pull back US engagement. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=343.16s)]
*  And yesterday he was asked repeatedly whether or not US troops would be sent to Gaza to [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=346.28s)]
*  help secure it while it's being rebuilt. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=352.12s)]
*  He did not rule that out. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=354.48s)]
*  This of course is a conflict that has been in the Gaza. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=356.84s)]
*  There's decades in the making, contested land since Israel's creation in 1948. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=359.96s)]
*  This is the first time a US president has suggested something like this with the US [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=364.96s)]
*  being an occupying force. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=369.15999999999997s)]
*  We have seen that Saudi Arabia, as you just said already, which is seemingly close to [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=371.76s)]
*  normalizing relations with Israel, has already said we're not going to do this. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=376.73999999999995s)]
*  And that is just a preview of what is expected to be the reaction from throughout the Arab [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=380.03999999999996s)]
*  world who want to see the Palestinians get their own state, who don't want to be taking [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=384.52s)]
*  Palestinian refugees into their own country, who don't want to hand Israel potentially [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=389.08s)]
*  that territory. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=394.28000000000003s)]
*  It's certainly a significant win for Prime Minister Netanyahu, were this to happen. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=395.28000000000003s)]
*  The right-wing elements in his coalition want to move in both on Gaza and of course the [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=399.56s)]
*  West Bank. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=405.04s)]
*  And we also, this is Donald Trump, a White House aide told me last night, who does feel [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=406.36s)]
*  with a swagger, if you will, in this second term, believing that he could get a big deal [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=412.20000000000005s)]
*  done. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=417.56s)]
*  Few would be bigger than this, even though part of this might even be a real estate [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=418.56s)]
*  transaction, something that he has considered in the past, talking about Gaza's beachfront [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=422.88s)]
*  property, even the Riviera of the Middle East. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=427.72s)]
*  For much, much more on this, let's bring in President Emeritus of the Council on Foreign [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=431.24s)]
*  Relations, Richard Haass. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=435.32s)]
*  He is author of the weekly newsletter, Home and Away, which is of course available on [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=436.8s)]
*  Substack, as well as retired CIA officer Mark Palmaropoulos. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=440.76000000000005s)]
*  He is an NBC News security and intelligence analyst. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=445.36s)]
*  Richard, let's start with you. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=448.48s)]
*  I mean, your reaction, it is hard to know at a time how seriously to take this. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=450.04s)]
*  Is this something, is Donald Trump actually suggesting sending military troops to the [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=456.96000000000004s)]
*  Middle East, to Gaza, or is this the beginning of some sort of negotiation, an extreme position, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=460.44000000000005s)]
*  if you will, perhaps to apply pressure on the region, allows him to maybe dial it back [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=467.56s)]
*  a little bit to get something done. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=473.48s)]
*  But even that seems so far-fetched. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=475.16s)]
*  It seems far-fetched. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=477.40000000000003s)]
*  We're all used to the idea of an opening bid. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=478.40000000000003s)]
*  And so one of my first reactions was to try to play this out. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=480.8s)]
*  Where could this lead? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=483.52000000000004s)]
*  You've got, for example, the King of Jordan showing up in Washington in a few days. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=484.52000000000004s)]
*  One of the dangers is that Donald Trump actually tries to follow this up, puts enormous pressure [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=488.42s)]
*  on countries like Jordan, which are already vulnerable, threatens to remove what, the [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=493.8s)]
*  $1.7 billion in aid. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=498.72s)]
*  So I worry that this is a nonstarter. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=500.16s)]
*  Let me just say that with the Palestinians, Jonathan. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=502.6s)]
*  Let's just posit that. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=504.52000000000004s)]
*  This is going to be unacceptable to the Palestinians. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=505.8s)]
*  The question is, is there a follow-up? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=509.32s)]
*  Does this cause crises in Jordan? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=511.88s)]
*  Does this cause crises in Egypt? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=514.04s)]
*  Does this encourage some of the worst elements in Israel? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=516.04s)]
*  It's one thing to think big about the Middle East. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=519.0s)]
*  When I thought the Trump administration might think big about the Middle East, I assumed [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=520.6s)]
*  it was to maybe press Bibi to go in the direction of some type of a Palestinian state, which, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=525.2s)]
*  among other things, would bring the Saudis on board and so forth. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=530.4s)]
*  This is thinking big, but in a way that's totally at odds with the history and political [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=534.0s)]
*  realities of the region. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=539.9200000000001s)]
*  So it makes me think, Juan, what you mentioned, the swagger. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=541.12s)]
*  There's a grandiosity to this, as though history doesn't matter. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=543.6s)]
*  I think there's a little bit of that here, that in a sense that Donald Trump is not bounded [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=548.0s)]
*  by history. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=553.56s)]
*  And also, it raises fundamental questions, and you're closer to it than I am, as is [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=554.56s)]
*  Ali, about the policy process. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=558.4s)]
*  You could not have a rigorous policy process filled with experts on the Middle East and [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=560.76s)]
*  come up with this proposal. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=565.8399999999999s)]
*  There is no way you could get from there to where we now are. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=567.4799999999999s)]
*  And Miki, as we see these images here of the devastation in Gaza, 15 months of conflict, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=570.28s)]
*  this is still home to 2.2 million people, and Donald Trump is talking about displacement [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=575.6s)]
*  on just a staggering scale. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=581.56s)]
*  I've heard a lot of different words about this, but the ones that stand out to me are, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=584.88s)]
*  this is impossible, this will never happen, maybe he doesn't mean it. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=589.64s)]
*  And I would like to try and put a pause on that thinking to an extent, because I think [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=593.24s)]
*  we've learned by now, and a lot of what we talked about here on Morning Joe during the [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=599.56s)]
*  campaign is Donald Trump does mean it. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=604.92s)]
*  He means it. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=608.8399999999999s)]
*  This is a man who said during the campaign he wouldn't pardon January 6 rioters, and [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=610.24s)]
*  he has done so. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=615.28s)]
*  This is a man who said that he would be your retribution and threatened retribution to [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=617.04s)]
*  people who worked on cases against him. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=622.76s)]
*  That is happening right now in the FBI. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=625.88s)]
*  Let's stop surmising as to whether or not he means it, because he means it. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=629.16s)]
*  Okay? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=636.6s)]
*  So, Mark Polymeropoulos, my question to you is, what will the promotion of this idea do [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=637.6s)]
*  to the delicate state of affairs in the region? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=642.56s)]
*  Right, Miki. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=645.7199999999999s)]
*  And so I think every CIA station chief in the Middle East woke up this morning with [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=647.76s)]
*  a migraine headache, because there's a potential for a generational counterterrorism nightmare [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=651.52s)]
*  here. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=656.64s)]
*  Let's look at the words that Donald Trump used yesterday, quote, take over Gaza, own [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=657.64s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=663.04s)]
*  These are triggering mechanisms for Islamic extremist groups. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=664.04s)]
*  Remember, Osama bin Laden's biggest beef with the United States decades ago was the U.S. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=666.72s)]
*  troop presence in Saudi Arabia. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=671.0s)]
*  Al-Qaeda in Iraq, same thing, the insurgency based on U.S. troops in Iraq. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=672.88s)]
*  So this kind of language only is going to galvanize groups that want to kill Americans. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=676.84s)]
*  And if I was in the CIA and is still in the CIA and the counterterrorism community, I'd [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=681.36s)]
*  be monitoring the Islamic extremist forums, because this is just a tremendous own goal. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=685.64s)]
*  And I worry that even if these are just words, as Richard said, perhaps part of some strange [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=690.96s)]
*  negotiating gambit, Americans might be less safe now. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=694.88s)]
*  And I can't imagine anybody in the CIA or the State Department who would have advocated [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=698.68s)]
*  this approach. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=703.4s)]
*  Talk about the ceasefire agreement in place. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=707.06s)]
*  There are hostages still due to come home. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=709.0s)]
*  We are watching these reunions. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=711.12s)]
*  They're incredibly emotional. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=712.76s)]
*  I know President Trump is very much into seeing these reunions and positive things like that [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=714.88s)]
*  happening, hoping to take credit for them and things like that. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=721.72s)]
*  What could these comments and this intention do to the ceasefire agreement that's in place [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=726.2s)]
*  right now? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=732.64s)]
*  Well, sure, Mika, because there's a delicate balance that's going on right now. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=733.64s)]
*  And we're trying to get through this phase one, perhaps to get to phase two. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=737.4s)]
*  But there are still hostages who need to be released. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=742.16s)]
*  And so if you're Hamas right now and you hear these comments, how do you even if there was [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=744.9599999999999s)]
*  some distrust in the past, but how do you see the U.S. as an interlocutor that you can [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=750.16s)]
*  agree with when they're saying all of the Palestinians have to be removed from the Gaza [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=754.64s)]
*  Strip with all this kind of fanciful language? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=759.9599999999999s)]
*  So even this kind of strange rhetoric from Trump could really alter a very delicate negotiating [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=762.12s)]
*  pattern right now, which has seen hostages released. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=770.12s)]
*  More are supposed to come this weekend. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=773.4399999999999s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=774.64s)]
*  All right. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=775.64s)]
*  NBC News security and intelligence analyst Mark Polymeropoulos, thank you very much for [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=776.64s)]
*  coming on the show this morning. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N447_XOSmok&t=783.24s)]
