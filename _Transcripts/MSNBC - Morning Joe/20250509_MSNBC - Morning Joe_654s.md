# 'He talks like Sherrod Brown': Chris Matthews on Pope Leo XIV's progressive message
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ)
*  Let's bring you to the conversation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Former MSNBC host and contributor to Washington Monthly, Chris Matthews, Washington Bureau [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=3.04s)]
*  Chief at USA Today, Susan Page, and professor of history at Rice University, historian Doug [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=8.74s)]
*  Brinkley. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=16.0s)]
*  So, Chris, talk about a perfect circle, things turning here. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=17.0s)]
*  When you were younger, you always heard a Catholic will never be elected president. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=23.7s)]
*  And then John Kennedy was elected in 1960. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=30.78s)]
*  Yesterday, I think everybody was saying the same thing. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=34.22s)]
*  I know one of my sons texted me and said, tell me, who were we expecting to be the Pope [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=37.26s)]
*  after the white smoke came out? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=45.18s)]
*  And I sent him five of the six names that were in the New York Times, but I intentionally [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=47.7s)]
*  left off the American because they said that will never happen. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=52.18s)]
*  And of course, Chris, we all were saying it and it happened. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=57.980000000000004s)]
*  What does it mean to you as a Catholic? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=61.58s)]
*  Well, it was a wow. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=64.14s)]
*  I have to tell you, I watched it. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=65.98s)]
*  I was emotional about it. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=68.78s)]
*  Like you, I never thought it would happen. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=71.78s)]
*  I thought it would have another Italian, I thought it would be Paolino, the Secretary [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=73.06s)]
*  of State who worked with Francis. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=76.78s)]
*  I thought it would be the other guy. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=78.9s)]
*  I got to tell them all the usual political calculations you and I try to figure out. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=80.34s)]
*  Is the moderate more likely to win? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=84.42s)]
*  Is the Francis guy likely to win? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=86.06s)]
*  The anti-Francis guy? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=88.22s)]
*  I thought it would be a moderate secretary of state. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=89.74s)]
*  And here he is, an American guy who spent 20 years in Peru, who became a Peruvian citizen, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=91.7s)]
*  as well as an American from Chicago, from Villanova, as we say in Philadelphia with [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=97.3s)]
*  an accent on the O. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=102.53999999999999s)]
*  Very much a big five character who grew up in Philly with the Philadelphia competition [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=104.42s)]
*  from La Salle and St. Joe's and Temple and Penn. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=110.46s)]
*  And he's all part of that, you know, with Ralph Willard, the coach there. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=113.61999999999999s)]
*  Now he's the new pope from there. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=117.46s)]
*  I mean, it's quite a day for Father Donahue at Villanova. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=119.25999999999999s)]
*  Amazing big victory for him to have a grad who's now the pope of the world, of 1.4 million [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=124.46s)]
*  Catholics. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=132.1s)]
*  When he comes here and speaks with a Chicago accent, I'm sure he still has, it's going [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=133.7s)]
*  to be a wondrous day for him to be back in the United States and talking to us with an [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=138.29999999999998s)]
*  American accent. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=143.29999999999998s)]
*  I mean, it's going to be an amazing thing. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=145.34s)]
*  We've had always foreign popes and now we've got one of our own. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=147.5s)]
*  And Leo, when he said Leo, I just jumped. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=151.78s)]
*  I said, Leo the 13th, this guy is going to be a social liberal. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=154.18s)]
*  He's going to be a progressive. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=158.29999999999998s)]
*  He's concerned about the poor, about working wages, about a living wage. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=160.29999999999998s)]
*  He talks like Sherrod Brown, actually. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=164.89999999999998s)]
*  We talk about the dignity of work. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=166.7s)]
*  Laborarum est ararum. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=169.54s)]
*  To work is to pray. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=172.85999999999999s)]
*  He's a big part of that. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=174.77999999999997s)]
*  To work in a factory is to pray. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=176.05999999999997s)]
*  It's so Catholic, so historic and so much a part of our social tradition. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=178.57999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, Chris, certainly. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=183.22s)]
*  He's taking a clam for Philadelphia there, but the pope certainly is Chicago through [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=184.22s)]
*  and through. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=189.34s)]
*  We can one can imagine, Doug, what Professor Brinkley, what that the mass would be like, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=190.34s)]
*  whether it's Grant Park or somewhere else, what that scene will be like in Chicago. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=193.98s)]
*  But let's talk also about what it means to have an American pope at this moment when [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=197.98000000000002s)]
*  the world's relationship with the United States has changed so much in recent months. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=202.9s)]
*  Well, you know, you just mentioned Grant Park and we think of Grant Park of 1968 and the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=207.54s)]
*  Yippies and the Black Panthers, tear gas, Mayor Daley's police. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=212.98000000000002s)]
*  And it became, you know, kind of a hellscape there. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=217.26s)]
*  And Grant Park was stagnant. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=220.29999999999998s)]
*  The city didn't reengage with it until 1979 when Pope John Paul II came to Grant Park [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=221.89999999999998s)]
*  and all of Chicago turned out for the pope. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=228.94s)]
*  And it kind of gave a rebirth to that park, which Barack Obama gave his victory speech. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=232.66s)]
*  The point is Chicago's Catholics, I cannot even exaggerate what this means for that community [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=238.5s)]
*  in the great Chicago fire of 1871 when the city bird Catholics were treated like dirt. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=245.94s)]
*  Mother Jones, the great labor organizer, was there trying to help people get away. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=252.54s)]
*  They were considered unworthy of human existence, Irish Catholics, and that had come to Chicago. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=257.1s)]
*  Cut to the power of John F. Kennedy becoming president. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=265.62s)]
*  It's only really Kennedy winning. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=269.78s)]
*  And now this is for the history books that America has a pope and one that thinks going [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=271.66s)]
*  to do a great job because Pope Leo XIV was hand chosen in a sense by Pope Francis and [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=280.22s)]
*  will continue, which doesn't get talked about, not climate change. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=288.18s)]
*  I'll be interested. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=291.38s)]
*  How do you think this pope will look at climate because Pope Francis really got deep in that? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=293.54s)]
*  He did. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=299.1s)]
*  I think he'll definitely carry on that legacy. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=300.54s)]
*  I think what's really important to understand is for the last two and a half years, Pope [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=303.90000000000003s)]
*  Leo has been basically head of HR at the Vatican. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=310.46000000000004s)]
*  He's been the pope, the bishop who has helped Pope Francis appoint bishops all around the [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=313.42s)]
*  world. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=318.46000000000004s)]
*  And Pope Francis emphasized, let's appoint bishops who are pastoral, who care about the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=319.78000000000003s)]
*  environment, who care about the poor, who care about God's people, and who want to engage [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=325.34000000000003s)]
*  other religions. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=329.26s)]
*  So there's sort of a sense among some Vatican observers, Susan Page, that Pope Francis put [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=330.26s)]
*  this cardinal in that position so he would get to know the other cardinals, which might [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=335.38s)]
*  help his election to be pope when that day came. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=339.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=342.98s)]
*  So all politics is local, not just in Chicago politics, but in papal politics as well. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=343.98s)]
*  You know, we've talked about how energizing this has been for American Catholics in Chicago [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=349.7s)]
*  and really across the country. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=355.94s)]
*  An opportunity for this new pope, if he chooses to take it, to have a big voice in America [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=356.94s)]
*  on a range of issues. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=362.3s)]
*  Doug mentioned climate change, on abortion, on immigration, an issue that's of course [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=364.5s)]
*  front and center at this White House and something that this new pope has talked about. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=370.58s)]
*  And Chris Matthews, I'm wondering, you bring a political eye to these things. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=376.18s)]
*  Do you think this pope will choose to be a force in American politics? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=381.86s)]
*  And could he if he wanted to? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=388.58000000000004s)]
*  Well, it's good to see Kevin O'Brien again. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=390.34000000000003s)]
*  Nice to see you, Father. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=393.5s)]
*  I think the fact that he spoke in Italian and in Spanish yesterday, not in English, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=396.82s)]
*  that he reasserted our connection with Europe, something that matters to me. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=402.34000000000003s)]
*  You talk about John F. Kennedy and the Spanish in Berlin, in Germany and West Berlin in 1963, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=406.58000000000004s)]
*  reuniting us with the free world. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=412.38s)]
*  I think it's very important. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=414.42s)]
*  I think the fact that he spent 20 years in Peru, he became a Peruvian citizen, as part [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=416.06s)]
*  of that, as well as an American, is very powerful. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=421.62s)]
*  And I think his message about immigration will be looking out for the poor. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=424.66s)]
*  It's going to be very much a North-South relationship. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=429.58s)]
*  He will come with his experience in Latin America and South America, as well as America [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=433.02s)]
*  and Chicago and Villanova. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=437.66s)]
*  And it's going to be very interesting to see how he pairs the two of our Latin American [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=439.96000000000004s)]
*  friends and new immigrants with his papacy. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=444.72s)]
*  I go back to this one thing, though. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=448.76s)]
*  He's an American. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=450.56s)]
*  I mean, there is nothing like this. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=451.56s)]
*  I never thought it would happen with Joe. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=455.96000000000004s)]
*  I never thought the cards were there for an American to pick them up. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=457.8s)]
*  It's like in the movie Time Place, the guy, the person who knew all the other cardinals [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=463.12s)]
*  was the best advantage to benefit from that. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=470.44s)]
*  I mean, he did work with the other cardinals in picking them and dealing with them. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=474.12s)]
*  And I think it's very important that he's one of us. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=478.2s)]
*  He's one of us. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=480.24s)]
*  You don't need a translator to talk to the Pope. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=481.24s)]
*  It's us and him. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=483.96s)]
*  And this is real. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=484.96s)]
*  To Catholics, I'm telling you, the fallen-away Catholics, the ones that go to church so often, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut9HmknPvNQ&t=487.59999999999997s)]
