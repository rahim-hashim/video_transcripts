# Elon Musk says he now 'regrets' some of his social media posts about Trump after fallout
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40)
*  Elon Musk says he now regrets some of the social media messages that he posted during [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=0.0s)]
*  last week's public feud with President Trump. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=6.24s)]
*  Musk did not specify which ones that he regretted writing, but did acknowledge they, quote, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=9.52s)]
*  went too far. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=16.72s)]
*  President Trump has said he has no interest in repairing the relationship with his former [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=17.72s)]
*  advisor, Carlos Cabello. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=22.28s)]
*  Some of them were about the big, the president's words, big, beautiful bill. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=23.84s)]
*  He was extremely critical. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=30.06s)]
*  Does it have any impact? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=32.04s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=34.72s)]
*  I think a lot of congressional Republicans have kind of dismissed this as Elon Musk getting [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=35.96s)]
*  emotional, getting a little too heated about his breakup with the White House. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=41.36s)]
*  And frankly, I don't think anyone at the White House wants him back. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  Elon Musk, while a very good political ally for this president, did create a lot of chaos [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=51.72s)]
*  in the White House, did overstep his authority, get into other people's turf. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=57.28s)]
*  Everyone remembers that cabinet meeting where Marco Rubio and Sean Duffy pushed back in [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=63.5s)]
*  front of everyone, and the president took their side. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=68.44s)]
*  So I just think even though Elon may want to make peace, everyone's kind of happy to [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=72.32s)]
*  see these two go their separate ways. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=78.75999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=81.76s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=82.76s)]
*  Moving on with the headlines, South Korea has stopped broadcasting anti-North Korean [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=83.76s)]
*  propaganda along the border between the two countries. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=87.48s)]
*  It comes as the new government in Seoul takes concrete steps to ease tensions with its rival. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=90.76s)]
*  The loudspeakers had been playing South Korean music in an attempt to undercut efforts by [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=97.44s)]
*  North Korea to stamp out the influence of pop culture and language among the population [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=102.52s)]
*  there. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=108.56s)]
*  And Michael Bloomberg is endorsing former governor Andrew Cuomo for mayor of New York [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=109.92s)]
*  City. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=115.8s)]
*  Bloomberg held the mayor's job for three terms. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=117.84s)]
*  In a statement, Bloomberg writes, in part, the question before New Yorkers is not who [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=121.52s)]
*  is the perfect choice. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=125.6s)]
*  No mayor is perfect. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=127.38s)]
*  The question is, who is the best choice? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=128.88s)]
*  To me, that choice is clear, Andrew Cuomo. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=131.0s)]
*  Cuomo is currently leading the primary field. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=135.72s)]
*  Election day is Tuesday, June 24th. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=138.2s)]
*  Willie, that's quite an endorsement. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=140.95999999999998s)]
*  It is. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=143.6s)]
*  It's an important endorsement of three term mayor of New York City, John Vermeer. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=144.67999999999998s)]
*  Michael Bloomberg, and interesting to see his statement in the endorsement. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=149.16s)]
*  He goes, look, he's not perfect. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=152.76s)]
*  Sort of acknowledging some of the flaws that a lot of New Yorkers see in the front runner [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=155.0s)]
*  in this race. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=159.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  It's in some ways captured the mood of the city about this race, where it feels like [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=161.07999999999998s)]
*  every candidate, there are some real misgivings about it. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  Governor Cuomo, he is running on what he says is a strong managerial run, but we know his [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=167.48s)]
*  time in office ended with scandal. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=172.28s)]
*  Of course, he received a lot of criticism for how he handled some of the parts of the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=174.04s)]
*  COVID pandemic. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=178.24s)]
*  It is a tightening race. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=180.12s)]
*  We have seen Zoram Andani really make some inroads here. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=181.96s)]
*  He seems to be the leader, Mike, of the non-Cuomo division, although we certainly could hear [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=185.24s)]
*  from him. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=189.8s)]
*  We had the city council speaker, Adams, Adrienne Adams, here yesterday. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=190.8s)]
*  She was impressive. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=192.8s)]
*  It was. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  And other candidates still very much in the mix, also because it's ranked choice voting. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=195.4s)]
*  It's hard to know what to make of this. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=199.48000000000002s)]
*  And we also truthfully haven't had a public poll in a while to really give us a snapshot [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=201.08s)]
*  of the race. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=206.04000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=207.04000000000002s)]
*  The ranked choice voting is interesting. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=208.04000000000002s)]
*  I haven't seen the ballot. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=209.04000000000002s)]
*  Has anybody seen the ballot? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=210.04000000000002s)]
*  I don't know what the ballot looks like. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=211.04000000000002s)]
*  I don't know how you do ranked choice voting. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=212.68s)]
*  But the Bloomberg endorsement is huge, because I think a lot of people in New York, New York [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=215.28s)]
*  city residents, no matter what borough you live in, you realize that the city, it's made [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=221.4s)]
*  a difference when Bloomberg was mayor just administratively. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=226.08s)]
*  Things went better in the city when he was mayor, because he's an administrator. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=230.0s)]
*  He knows how to run things. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  And if you look around the playgrounds in this city, over in Brooklyn, your neighborhood, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=236.24s)]
*  the playgrounds that were built, the things that were made accessible to more citizens [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=239.96s)]
*  of this city during the Bloomberg administration, I think that's going to have an impact, a [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=246.48000000000002s)]
*  big impact on the race, is the endorsement of Andrew Coleman. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTwTEygIM40&t=250.12s)]
