Video Description: Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, calls herself compassionate after she was repeatedly pressed on cuts to Medicaid in the House's budget bill at a town hall in her home state last week, and pushed back on an attendee who said the cuts would lead to deaths and after she doubled down on her stance over the weekend in a video posted to her social media.

# 'The entire conversation makes it worse': Joe blasts Sen. Ernst's latest defense
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA)
*  We people are not well, we all are going to die. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=0.0s)]
*  So for heaven's sakes, for heaven's sakes, folks, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=7.0s)]
*  I made an incorrect assumption that everyone in the auditorium understood that, yes, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=14.0s)]
*  we are all going to perish from this earth. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=24.0s)]
*  So I apologize. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=28.0s)]
*  And I'm really, really glad that I did not have to bring up the subject of the tooth fairy as well. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=31.0s)]
*  You care to clarify your comments from the town hall last week, Senator? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=39.0s)]
*  Just to set the record straight. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=44.0s)]
*  I'm very compassionate and you need to listen to the entire conversation. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=46.0s)]
*  Can you explain your- [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=50.0s)]
*  Can you explain your- [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=51.0s)]
*  ... protect the most vulnerable? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=52.0s)]
*  You know, actually the entire conversation really makes it worse. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=54.0s)]
*  Because if you sit and listen to the entire conversation, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=59.0s)]
*  she's actually hearing from constituents who are saying- [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=63.0s)]
*  Scared. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=67.0s)]
*  Cuts in Medicaid, which are coming, cuts in Medicaid are going to impact children in Iowa. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=68.0s)]
*  Up to 40% of children in Iowa get their primary care from Medicaid. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=76.0s)]
*  It's going to impact mothers and grandmothers, fathers, grandfathers, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=79.0s)]
*  who depend on Medicaid for nursing home care. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=84.0s)]
*  So if you listen to the whole thing, it gets even worse. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=88.0s)]
*  And this is an example of somebody who I get maybe a staff member said, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=93.0s)]
*  hey, why don't you go to a cemetery and make light of the fact that you said in response to concerns [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=97.0s)]
*  about people's health care being cut, well, everybody's going to die anyway. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=104.0s)]
*  So she goes to the cemetery. It's just, again, it's- [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=108.0s)]
*  Really strange. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=110.0s)]
*  It's strange. It's also just malpractice politically. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=111.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you watch the video, and for people who couldn't see it, we're listening in the car. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=121.0s)]
*  Joni Ernst doing a selfie video in a cemetery with that smug response to her saying, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=125.0s)]
*  we're all going to die. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=131.0s)]
*  And you can't help but think that many of these Republicans have over-learned the lessons of Donald Trump, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=133.0s)]
*  that they're trying to always be combative, never retreat, never apologize for anything. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=139.0s)]
*  In this case, you could have said, I made a flippant comment, I'm trying to make a joke, it didn't land, I apologize and move on. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=145.0s)]
*  But the lesson now and the rule of Republican politics in the Trump area is, never back down. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=153.0s)]
*  Troll your opponents, own the libs, however you want to put it. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=159.0s)]
*  I mean, she's an honorable person. She served the country, Senator Ernst, in the military. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=163.0s)]
*  But I just, I don't know, you made a foolish comment that offended a lot of people [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=168.0s)]
*  and sort of trivialized the pain that some people are hoping to avoid with all these cuts. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=174.0s)]
*  And then you make a joke about it in the cemetery. So I don't know, that's an interesting choice. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=179.0s)]
*  So well put. And I also just wonder, what's the thinking? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=185.0s)]
*  I know they were trying, she, I guess there was an attempt to troll her constituents, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=189.0s)]
*  which is again, political malpractice, but are they driving in the car and they go, let's stop at a cemetery? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=194.0s)]
*  I mean, just what, the time spent to be so mean. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=200.0s)]
*  Well, the thing is again, I guess it's beyond, it's just beyond me. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=205.0s)]
*  First of all, do we all say stupid things? Yes. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=209.0s)]
*  I'll just be for myself. Yeah, because I say stupid things every day. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=213.0s)]
*  And you know, there's a running record of it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=217.0s)]
*  But in that position, you say something like we're all going to die. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=220.0s)]
*  Just like Willie said, you go, you know, I made a flippant remark. I shouldn't have made it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=223.0s)]
*  I understand there are a lot of people out there who depend on Medicaid for their health care. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=228.0s)]
*  I'm going to fight for them. The people of Iowa, especially in Red State, you know, in rural Iowa, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=231.0s)]
*  I'm going to be fighting for you. I mean, that's how you respond. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=236.0s)]
*  Willie, you are so right. I mean, they think and there's something that I've been saying to Democrats, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=240.0s)]
*  the Democrats go, we're going to lose every election for the rest of ever. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=245.0s)]
*  I'm like, listen, dude, that's what people thought after Ronald Reagan won 49 states. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=251.0s)]
*  Reagan skills were not transferable. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=256.0s)]
*  That's what people thought after Barack Obama won. Barack Obama's skills were not transferable. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=259.0s)]
*  Well, Trumpism works with Trump. It doesn't work with Johnny Ernst. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=265.0s)]
*  It doesn't work with J.D. Vance. It doesn't work with anybody. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=271.0s)]
*  It's not a transferable skill. This is why when Donald Trump is on the ballot, Republicans do better. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=274.0s)]
*  And off your elections with Donald Trump is not on the ballot and people that don't usually get out and vote for Republicans, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=283.0s)]
*  you know, they stay home. And so, Willie, you're right. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=288.0s)]
*  They think this is a transferable, like political tactic that they can use Donald Trump's political tactics. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=292.0s)]
*  No, they can't. It's like Democrats who try, you know, you can't couldn't do what Barack Obama or Bill Clinton or others did. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=298.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's like political tactics and his approach, he gets away with it because he's been in the public spotlight [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=306.0s)]
*  for 50 years writing books and going on reality TV shows and telling people you're fired. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=316.0s)]
*  It doesn't work for Johnny Ernst or these other Republicans. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=324.0s)]
*  Yeah, you can't go from Iowa nice to the apprentice. You're fired. It doesn't. It just doesn't add up or work. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=328.0s)]
*  So I don't know, but she's holding her ground on that. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=334.0s)]
*  We saw her at the end and the Capitol Hill yesterday as the elevator doors were closing, saying, check the context. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=337.0s)]
*  You guys are wrong. So she's made a decision to stand by that comment. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0VxSiTeiKA&t=343.0s)]
