# Longtime Republican rips Trump, says WH in 'very bad shape' on economy
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w)
*  Right now, obviously today marks the 100th day of the second Trump administration. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=0.0s)]
*  Yes, the president will be holding a rally in Warren, Michigan, at Macomb Community College, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  where he made two campaign stops ahead of last year's election. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=10.92s)]
*  It comes as five major polls over the past week show historically low approval ratings [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=15.32s)]
*  for the president. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=20.76s)]
*  Trump yesterday dismissed the numbers in a long post on social media, writing that the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  pollsters should be investigated for election fraud. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=27.68s)]
*  President Trump has signed 143 executive orders, so far more than any other president in history [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=33.88s)]
*  in the first 100 days. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=40.28s)]
*  Meanwhile, in an appearance on Fox News over the weekend, longtime Republican strategist [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=42.6s)]
*  Karl Rove gave a stark assessment of the president's handling of the economy. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=48.32s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=54.4s)]
*  When it gets to the economy, he is in very bad shape. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=55.559999999999995s)]
*  And it's not only that he's in the short term in bad shape. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=58.8s)]
*  There's also evidence in the poll that no matter, even if he gets his way on certain [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=63.879999999999995s)]
*  things like tariffs, that he's not good in the long run. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=67.68s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=71.28s)]
*  Trump policies. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=72.56s)]
*  Today, will it help the economy? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=73.56s)]
*  32 percent say yes. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=75.48s)]
*  Will it hurt the economy? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=77.36s)]
*  His policies? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=78.36s)]
*  54 percent say no. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=79.36s)]
*  10 percent no difference. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=81.16s)]
*  In the long run, will it help the country? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=82.84s)]
*  40 percent. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=85.56s)]
*  In the long run, will it hurt the country? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=86.72s)]
*  51 percent. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=89.36s)]
*  So there's some very deep-seated skepticism among ordinary Americans about the effect [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=90.44s)]
*  of the economy, the president's economic policies, both in the short run and the long run. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=95.56s)]
*  He was elected because people had more confidence in his ability to help the economy and lower [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=101.72s)]
*  prices than they did in Kamala Harris. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  So to what do you attribute that new skepticism or real concern about the economy? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=110.16s)]
*  Well, I have a slightly different view. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  I agree with you that they voted for him because they felt better, in my opinion, about — they [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=118.52s)]
*  looked at the last four years under Biden-Harris and said, not good. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=123.96s)]
*  And they looked at and remembered the four years under President Trump and said, those [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=127.72s)]
*  were a lot better. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=132.51999999999998s)]
*  I think this was a hope. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=133.51999999999998s)]
*  I don't think it was based upon an explicit understanding of what he was going to do. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=134.96s)]
*  They just hoped that he would do better on inflation and jobs and economic growth. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=139.3s)]
*  And then when he came in, just the sort of chaos and the inability of the administration [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=145.02s)]
*  to explain what they're doing, I think has hurt them very much. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=149.38000000000002s)]
*  And a tanking of the economy, you could add into that. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=152.98000000000002s)]
*  That's Karl Rove, the Wall Street Journal editorial board this morning argues, quote, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=155.3s)]
*  at 100 days, Trump 2.0 is in trouble. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=159.5s)]
*  The new piece on the Op-Ed page reads this way. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=162.9s)]
*  The White House motto seems to be that if something is worth doing, it's worth doing [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=166.0s)]
*  too much. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=176.48s)]
*  That's especially true on tariffs, which could sink his presidency. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=177.48s)]
*  Ken Griffin, the investor and major donor to Mr. Trump, summed it up last week as a [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=180.96s)]
*  self-inflicted blow to the American brand. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=185.24s)]
*  The U.S. is needlessly ceding global economic leadership. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=188.2s)]
*  The White House re-elected Mr. Trump in part because they remembered fondly his first term [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=192.2s)]
*  economy. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=196.11999999999998s)]
*  But that success was owed mainly to his pursuit of conventional GOP priorities like tax reform [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=197.42s)]
*  and deregulation. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=202.72s)]
*  This term, he is indulging his trade in foreign policy obsessions and the early results are [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=204.38s)]
*  negative. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=209.72s)]
*  He will fail unless he heeds the warnings. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=210.72s)]
*  That is from the Wall Street Journal. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=213.35999999999999s)]
*  President Trump obviously doesn't see it that way. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=216.32s)]
*  He thinks all the polls are fake, talking about the interference in an election. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=217.96s)]
*  Unclear which election he's referring to, but obviously the data is there. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=222.96s)]
*  Fox News, the Wall Street Journal, even many conservatives saying not so good so far. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=227.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, he won the last election and he's prohibited from running again. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=231.88s)]
*  So it's not sure what he's talking about there. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=234.8s)]
*  We'll certainly hear a very different message from the president. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=236.36s)]
*  Tonight he heads to Michigan, one of those blue wall states that he won twice, in 16 [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=239.4s)]
*  and 24. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=244.60000000000002s)]
*  He's closing it in 2020. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=246.07999999999998s)]
*  A lot of his closest aides feel like that's where he made his strength, white working [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=247.23999999999998s)]
*  class voters, and flipped over just enough of whether it's black and Latino voters and [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=250.88s)]
*  gathered gathered some new members of his coalition this time around. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=255.24s)]
*  You know, he's going to be talking about the economy. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=259.56s)]
*  He's going to bet he's but when he does so, it's going to be in sharp contrast with reality. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=261.46s)]
*  We have seen the markets quake. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=266.6s)]
*  We have seen consumer sentiment plummet. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=268.0s)]
*  We have seen real worries about inflation because of this self-inflicted trade war, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=269.86s)]
*  because of these tariffs that very few people think is a sound economic plan. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=275.0s)]
*  We're also going to hear him lean in heavily, I am told, on the issue of immigration, which [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=280.56s)]
*  is what they will keep want to coming back. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=284.32s)]
*  The topic they keep wanting to return to, even yesterday on the White House lawn, putting [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=286.08s)]
*  up posters on the fence there on the White House driveway of who they say are illegal [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=290.46s)]
*  immigrants who then committed violent crimes here in the United States, which is their [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=295.88s)]
*  justification for their deportation plan, and putting them up in a way that if a newscaster [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=299.0s)]
*  is doing a live shot from the White House, that's the backdrop. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=304.6s)]
*  It's unavoidable. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=307.48s)]
*  Those pictures, it's a very in-your-face moment, Willie, and that's what they want to talk [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=308.64000000000004s)]
*  about because so much else, they can read the polls. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=313.08000000000004s)]
*  I talked to someone in the White House yesterday saying, it's not panic, but of course they [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=316.0s)]
*  understand their numbers are down. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=320.0s)]
*  They'd rather have good polls than bad. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=321.72s)]
*  They recognize right now American voters, not quite sure what they're seeing. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=323.92s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, and that is the attitude in the White House is we'd rather have good polls [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=328.08000000000004s)]
*  and bad polls. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=334.56s)]
*  A lot of stuff has been going on over the first 100 days, but we're going to start focusing [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=335.56s)]
*  on trade deals, on peace deals, on tariff deals, and then they say they believe those [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=340.8s)]
*  numbers are going to turn around. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=348.16s)]
*  John Heilman, though, there is, as John Elmire said, always a focus on immigration if they [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=349.72s)]
*  think that they need to move from another subject. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=354.40000000000003s)]
*  The problem there is they're upside down on immigration in several of the polls. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=359.88s)]
*  Also, just about every poll I've seen over the past week has shown they're upside down [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=364.0s)]
*  significantly, even on the Abrego Garcia case. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=369.15999999999997s)]
*  And now, of course, headlines over the past couple days about two young children that [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=374.64s)]
*  were taken out of the country with their mother, one with stage four cancer, I believe, advanced [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=381.32s)]
*  cancer. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=388.92s)]
*  And so, again, even on the issue that should be, again, the winner for them, there is this [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=390.92s)]
*  overreach that always seems to turn, if not the most ardent supporters, certainly those [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=399.04s)]
*  swing voters that put the president over the top in the upper Midwest, blue wall states, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=404.76s)]
*  turning them off. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=410.8s)]
*  And I mean, we see the numbers dropping among Hispanics. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=411.8s)]
*  We see the numbers dropping among Americans without a college degree. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=415.08000000000004s)]
*  We see it dropping especially with younger Americans. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=419.6s)]
*  So there are these specific areas where this overreach, as the Wall Street Journal pointed [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=422.96000000000004s)]
*  out, this overreach seems to be getting in the way of even issues like immigration, which [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=429.12s)]
*  should be helping President Trump. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=434.20000000000005s)]
*  Well, yeah, that's right, Joe. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=438.48s)]
*  I got to say, you look at all of the polling that we got over the weekend at this 100-day [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=439.76000000000005s)]
*  mark and, you know, it is, he is now, since the invention of modern polling, if you're [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=445.20000000000005s)]
*  judging public opinion through the best instruments we have, his first 100 days are less popular [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=452.0s)]
*  and his presidency is in worse state than any president in the history of modern polling. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=458.68s)]
*  And if you look across those issues, this gets to your immigration point. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=464.08000000000004s)]
*  There isn't a bright spot. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=467.72s)]
*  You can't say, well, he's down here, but he's doing great over here. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=470.44s)]
*  Immigration is the strongest issue they have and he is across all of that polling. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=475.2s)]
*  His numbers of immigration aren't great. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=480.71999999999997s)]
*  And I think you've got to think back to the first term when immigration was an important [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=482.47999999999996s)]
*  reason why he won the first term, often overlooked by people in analyzing the 2016 race. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=489.24s)]
*  And what happened was he lost the plot with family separation. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=496.48s)]
*  The family separation policy was when people started to put a human face to the cruelty [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=501.04s)]
*  of that policy and he lost a lot of support on immigration around that issue. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=507.32000000000005s)]
*  And I think from it was predictable that if he tried to do an immigration policy that [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=513.24s)]
*  was as draconian as he promised, that the same phenomenon would happen now. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=519.0400000000001s)]
*  The Abrego Garcia case and a number of these other cases are getting a ton of attention [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=523.6s)]
*  for good reason, and they are dragging his numbers down on an issue where in general [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=527.88s)]
*  he has a lot of support among the American people. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=532.64s)]
*  And in general, it's always been one of his strongest issues. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=535.08s)]
*  They are just comprehensively, politically speaking, in a huge amount of trouble with [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=538.2s)]
*  the American people right now. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=543.24s)]
*  And Mika, I'll tell you what was so remarkable about the polling that came out is, of [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=545.52s)]
*  course, we have the headlines about President Trump because he's a president. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=551.52s)]
*  That's where the headlines are going to go. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=556.9200000000001s)]
*  Being at 39 percent in several polls, 40 in some polls, being extraordinarily low on [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=558.24s)]
*  a lot of issues. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=565.08s)]
*  But then the other side of the story is a polling on Democrats. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=566.44s)]
*  The Democratic brand is as bad as it has ever been. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=570.16s)]
*  And really one of the most stunning polls is this one right here with Donald Trump at [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=575.08s)]
*  historically low numbers. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=580.4s)]
*  Voters were asking the ABC News Washington Post poll, who do you trust to do a better [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=583.64s)]
*  job handling the country's main problems? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=589.04s)]
*  Donald Trump still beating Democrats by seven percentage points. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=592.8s)]
*  Of course, 30 percent of Americans still up for grabs because they say we don't trust [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=598.88s)]
*  either them. By the way, for people who have always dreamed of an independent county, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=605.24s)]
*  candidate being president of the United States, that poll right there is something [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=610.4s)]
*  that's going to be passed around for the next several weeks, because again, 30 percent [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=615.8s)]
*  of Americans say none of the above. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=621.36s)]
*  But Democrats, again, this should be a time for Democrats to step through the door that [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=624.16s)]
*  voters and Donald Trump has opened up for them and they're not doing it. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=629.24s)]
*  And one Democratic governor, J.B. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=633.24s)]
*  Pritzker of Illinois, he took note of that. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=635.16s)]
*  And he's going to be a great candidate for the next election. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XGBm11f7w&t=640.4s)]
