# Joe: Gabbard's video shows the 'great divide' down the middle of Trump's MAGA base
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4)
*  Doesn't Trump is listening to the anti-war wing of his party? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=0.0s)]
*  Maybe he'll listen to the anti-war wing of his own administration, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=4.0s)]
*  like Tulsi Gabbard, his own director of national intelligence. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=7.0s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard testified in March that the intelligence community said [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=11.0s)]
*  Iran wasn't building a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=15.0s)]
*  What she said, I think they were very close to having one. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=17.0s)]
*  This is the benefit of appointing unqualified crazy people to your team. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=20.0s)]
*  You can always be like, do you know how crazy and unqualified she is? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=27.0s)]
*  I don't care what she said. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=32.0s)]
*  That's a clip from The Daily Show on President Trump blowing off Tulsi Gabbard, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=36.0s)]
*  his own director of national intelligence. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=40.0s)]
*  Politico is reporting on the tensions between the two, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=43.0s)]
*  stemming in part from Gabbard's recent social media post warning about nuclear annihilation. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=46.0s)]
*  According to Politico, quote, Trump saw the unauthorized video and became incensed, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=53.0s)]
*  complaining to associates at the White House that she had spoken out of turn. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=58.0s)]
*  Trump reportedly saw it as an audacious attempt to steer him toward her [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=62.0s)]
*  anti-interventionalist approach to foreign policy. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=68.0s)]
*  It was a bizarre thing to do, obviously a bizarre thing to do, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=72.0s)]
*  especially if you hadn't spoken with the president who appointed you [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=76.0s)]
*  and the president whose administration you work for. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=81.0s)]
*  I mean, look at it just seriously. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=85.0s)]
*  John Heilman, I will say as bizarre as that video was, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=87.0s)]
*  it really does underline the divide, the great divide down the middle of Donald Trump's maga base. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=91.0s)]
*  You know, 2003, the closest parallel, obviously, the invasion of Iraq. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=99.0s)]
*  You had Republicans marching lockstep, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=104.0s)]
*  not only in Congress, but also outside of Congress behind George W. Bush's decision to go into Iraq. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=107.0s)]
*  Not so here. Talk about the divide in the maga base [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=113.0s)]
*  and also how that divide rose out of Donald Trump opposing, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=117.0s)]
*  flatly opposing in the campaigns of 2016, 2020, and 2024, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=124.0s)]
*  this type of intervention and wars in the Middle East. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=129.0s)]
*  Well, right, Joe. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=132.0s)]
*  First of all, if you're going to, in a conventional administration, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=133.0s)]
*  if you're a senior official and you want to try to influence the president's thinking, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=138.0s)]
*  you generally don't want to leave fingerprints, right? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=143.0s)]
*  So you have those, you go on background as a senior official or a source familiar in the New York Times. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=145.0s)]
*  You don't put out a highly produced video with speaking straight to camera, weighing in and limiting the president. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=152.0s)]
*  Speaking straight to camera, basically saying if the president does this, he's going to lead us to World War III. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=158.0s)]
*  Not a traditional move inside of any administration. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=163.0s)]
*  Yes, it looks more like a Democratic attack ad than it looks like, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=166.0s)]
*  than a part of it, product of internal debate inside the Trump administration. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=169.0s)]
*  So Tulsi Gabbard may be on thin ice there because Trump does not like to have his, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=173.0s)]
*  him to feel like this has been boxed in by people who work for him. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=177.0s)]
*  You are right, though, you know, what she is representing there is a point of view. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=181.0s)]
*  It is the point of view of Tucker Carlson, the point of Marjorie Taylor Greene, the point of view of Steve Bannon, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=185.0s)]
*  the point of view of Charlie Kirk, a lot of very powerful people in Donald Trump, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=190.0s)]
*  particularly in the media sphere, but not wholly in the media sphere of Donald Trump's base on the MAGA right. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=195.0s)]
*  And then you have obviously this much larger, more traditional piece, largely in the legislative branch. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=202.0s)]
*  People like Lindsey Graham would be the poster child for those who think that the United States should get involved here. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=207.0s)]
*  And yes, it is true that Trump has throughout not just on the Iraq question, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=213.0s)]
*  but throughout one of his proudest talking points has always been no wars. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=218.0s)]
*  I didn't get us into any wars in my first term. I will not get us into any wars in our second term. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=223.0s)]
*  He has very, been very powerful as a place where the MAGA base is, in fact, connected to a broader American public, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=228.0s)]
*  which is in fact sick of forever wars and does feel as though the U.S. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=234.0s)]
*  has been has often made giant costly mistakes getting involved in these kinds of conflicts. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=238.0s)]
*  But Trump is a man of absolutes, Joe, as you know, he loves to be able to say things like we've gotten into no wars. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=243.0s)]
*  But he also is on record for a long time saying Iran must not have a nuclear weapon. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=250.0s)]
*  And that's where we get to this conflict. Trump normally takes an absolute position where he feels safe, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=255.0s)]
*  that there won't be another absolutist position that he has raised that will conflict with it. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=261.0s)]
*  But he's being told by many that those two things are in opposition, that he's going to have to get involved actively in this war [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=266.0s)]
*  if he's going to accomplish the other absolute that he's pledged to, which is Iran not getting a nuclear weapon. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=272.0s)]
*  Now, I know the intelligence is murky on this, but this is the kind of situation Trump hates, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=277.0s)]
*  where two absolute promises he's made are in conflict. And I have no idea where he's going to come down in the end. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=282.0s)]
*  He's under a lot of pressure from both sides, though, Jonathan. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=287.0s)]
*  Yeah, he is. And I wrote on this today. But let's remember back in 2020, after the Soleimani strike, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=289.0s)]
*  you talk about the divide in the media. You could go on Fox News back then. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=295.0s)]
*  At eight o'clock, Tucker Carlson was talking through Trump, through television, saying, don't do this, don't retaliate. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=298.0s)]
*  And then at nine o'clock, Sean Hannity, a much more hawkish view, suggesting this might be the moment to strike on Tehran. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=304.0s)]
*  Trump, close to both men, spoke to both men privately as well as watch the show, eventually sided with Carlson, didn't escalate. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=309.0s)]
*  This time around, it feels a little different. John is right in this divide in the MAGA base. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=316.0s)]
*  I've written about it for today. Carlson, though, Trump just called a kook. He doesn't seem to be listening to Carlson. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=321.0s)]
*  He seems to be leaning more towards the hawkish viewpoint. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=327.0s)]
*  And also, Joe Amica, at this moment where it seems like Israel is going full force anyway, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=330.0s)]
*  Trump wants to associate himself with their success. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=336.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk5hwCaTZi4&t=351.0s)]
