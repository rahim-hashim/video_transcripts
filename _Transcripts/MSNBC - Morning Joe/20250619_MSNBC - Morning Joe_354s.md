# Controversial Gaza aid sites under increased scrutiny
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc)
*  Israel isn't just trading fire with Iran right now. The IDF is still fighting its war against [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=0.0s)]
*  Hamas in Gaza. Palestinian health officials say Israeli gunfire and strikes have killed [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  at least 140 people across the enclave in the past 24 hours. The humanitarian crisis [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=11.6s)]
*  is also worsening, if that's possible. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=19.62s)]
*  Let's bring in NBC News international correspondent Matt Bradley live from Tel Aviv. Matt, what [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=22.82s)]
*  is the latest? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=28.88s)]
*  Yeah, good morning, Mika. So as we're seeing this evolving war between Iran and Israel [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=30.56s)]
*  that threatens to bring in the entire region, we shouldn't avert our eyes from the continuing [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=36.2s)]
*  humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip, where as you mentioned, we're still seeing massive [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=40.36s)]
*  numbers of casualties every single day. And actually, a lot of those folks are killed [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=45.08s)]
*  and have been killed waiting in line for much needed food being distributed by a U.S.-backed [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=50.18s)]
*  organization that has attracted a lot of criticism and a lot of scrutiny. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=55.8s)]
*  This effort just had its bloodiest day two days ago when around 60 people were shot dead [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=60.199999999999996s)]
*  while waiting in line. And there are completely competing different versions of what happened [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=64.75999999999999s)]
*  there. Here's our report. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=69.88s)]
*  In Gaza these days, trying to stay alive can cost you your life. It's what happened to [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=74.08s)]
*  Sanal Jorani's husband, Khaled, as the 36-year-old father of five waited in an aid distribution [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  center last week. He was gunned down, his family said. He was shot in the head. NBC [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=85.36s)]
*  News has not been able to establish the full circumstances around his death. Khaled Erdahma [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=91.16s)]
*  was among the latest casualties around a new aid system established by an American-backed [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=101.4s)]
*  agency, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. Two eyewitnesses present at the aid station [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  said Khaled and others were killed by Israeli soldiers posted nearby. But the Israeli military [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=112.44000000000001s)]
*  has blamed Hamas for the repeated shootings near aid sites. Israel has hailed the new [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=117.4s)]
*  effort as the best way to get much needed food to the more than two million Gazans without [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=122.24000000000001s)]
*  letting it fall into the hands of Hamas. The group says it's distributed more than 26 million [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=127.26s)]
*  meals so far after the territory endured a complete blockade for 11 weeks. But in the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=132.26s)]
*  month since it began, Palestinian health authorities in Hamas-controlled Gaza say nearly [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=139.12s)]
*  400 people have been killed while waiting for food. And established humanitarian agencies [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=143.24s)]
*  and the United Nations have refused to work with the group, accusing it of lacking experience. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=148.84s)]
*  What do you see as their primary mistake here? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=153.56s)]
*  You have two million people desperate for food and you establish four distribution points, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=155.56s)]
*  only four, and you tell people this is where you can come to get aid. Of course you're [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=160.8s)]
*  going to have crowd control problems. No aid organization would recommend doing it [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=164.52s)]
*  in that way. The group has also been criticized for its opaque origins and a perceived financial [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=169.12s)]
*  dependence on Israel's government, which Israel denied. Just days before it launches, executive [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=174.28s)]
*  director Jake Wood resigned, saying the work would compromise his neutrality, impartiality [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=179.66000000000003s)]
*  and independence. Since then, the Boston Consulting Group disavowed its previous pro bono work [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=185.0s)]
*  the GHF and fired two partners who helped found the agency last year for their serious [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=191.24s)]
*  failure of judgment, but provided no further details. I had a rare interview with GHF Chairman [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=196.24s)]
*  Johnny Moore. Who finances the GHF? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=202.28s)]
*  GHF is a private foundation, like lots of private foundations. It doesn't disclose its [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=205.52s)]
*  donors. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=211.56s)]
*  But then why not reveal the sources of your funding? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=212.56s)]
*  I think anything that we do and anything that we say publicly is going to distract from [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=215.24s)]
*  the mission. And we have one mission, just one mission, which is defeat Gazans. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=220.32s)]
*  Moore was appointed to lead the GHF earlier this month. The PR professional brings an [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=225.28s)]
*  evangelical Christian ideology to the GHF. He helped chair President Trump's Evangelical [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=229.6s)]
*  Advisory Board during his first term and even prayed with the president in the Oval Office. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=234.56s)]
*  You have yourself a somewhat messianic perspective on Israel, a religious view on the reason [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=239.83999999999997s)]
*  for this state. Do you think that compromises your role in this organization? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=247.56s)]
*  My views are well known, and I certainly don't think any theological beliefs that I have [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=252.6s)]
*  or don't have compromised my role. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=256.72s)]
*  Israel's government has denied that it's behind the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. But last [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=258.96s)]
*  month, Israel's top opposition leader publicly implied without evidence that Israel was funding [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=263.4s)]
*  the new effort through secret shell companies. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=268.0s)]
*  If the government is funding this humanitarian aid, then why not just say it out loud? Because [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=270.42s)]
*  the world is so against us for not taking care of the population in Gaza. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=276.24s)]
*  But in the wake of Hamas' terrorist attacks of October 7, 2023, providing even basic food [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=279.6s)]
*  to Gazans is controversial here. Many Israelis believe that Hamas should release all the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=286.56s)]
*  remaining hostages before aid returns to Gaza. Despite the violence and persistent hunger, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=291.28000000000003s)]
*  GHF's role in aid distribution looks set to continue. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=296.72s)]
*  Ten-year-old Jude Abu Hussein also lost his dad at a shooting near a GHF station last week. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=301.04s)]
*  He's survived part of his youth without food. Now he'll grow up without a father. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=306.24s)]
*  And Mika, as you can see, after a months-long blockade without any aid coming in from outside, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=315.92s)]
*  these Gazans are desperate. But just trying to feed themselves and their families, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=321.12s)]
*  it can get them killed. Mika? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=326.24s)]
*  NBC's Matt Bradley, live from Israel, thank you very much for that report. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=329.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx083Mv0rlc&t=336.24s)]
