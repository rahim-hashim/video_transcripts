Video Description: El Salvador President Nayib Bukele told reporters during a meeting with President Donald Trump on Monday that he wouldn't return a man the Justice Department said it had mistakenly deported to his country. Abrego Garcia has never been charged criminally in the United States or El Salvador, according to court filings.

# 'SCOTUS partly to blame': Court could've ordered return of deported man, says legal analyst
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI)
*  We've got a lot going on here. I want to start with this though, Danny. Complicating matters [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=0.0s)]
*  is that Abrego Garcia, the mistaken, and I use that word lightly. I put that in quotes because [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=8.0s)]
*  aren't they all, all these deportations that have happened to this El Salvador prison legally [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=14.64s)]
*  questionable. But in terms of this mistaken deportation, it's not clear how this U.S. Supreme [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=21.44s)]
*  Court would have jurisdiction. Points made by Secretary of State Marco Rubio yesterday. Take a [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=28.48s)]
*  look. I don't understand what the confusion is. This individual is a citizen of El Salvador. He [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=35.28s)]
*  was illegally in the United States and was returned to his country. That's where you deport people, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=41.36s)]
*  back to their country of origin, except for Venezuela that wasn't refusing to take people [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  back or places like that. I can tell you this, Mr. President. No, the foreign policy of the United [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=49.6s)]
*  States is conducted by the President of the United States, not by a court. And no court in [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=54.56s)]
*  the United States has a right to conduct the foreign policy of the United States. It's that simple. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=59.440000000000005s)]
*  End of story. So you know, there's been a lot of criticism of the Supreme Court, the way they [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=63.68000000000001s)]
*  phrase their decision, and you predicted how everything would go down on Friday. And at the [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=69.12s)]
*  same time, this is difficult, isn't it? And the Supreme Court may have done all they can do. You [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=75.12s)]
*  have an El Salvador resident return to El Salvador and a judge in Washington, D.C., telling [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=80.88s)]
*  El Salvador to return, send back one of their own residents to the United States. It's more [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=88.08s)]
*  complicated than it looks, which Marco Rubio is pointing out that, look, what's the deal, guys? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  Politically, we'll get to the politics of this. This is a winner for the Trump administration, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=99.44s)]
*  in my opinion, and then on top of it, distracting from all the other questionable deportations. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=105.04s)]
*  Can you comment on the Secretary of State's explanation of this? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=111.68s)]
*  The Secretary of State's explanation, like much of the Trump administration's position, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=117.28s)]
*  all was predictable. And as you mentioned, I was here on Friday and I read the Supreme Court's [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=122.24000000000001s)]
*  order and anyone reading it could have seen this coming. I would love to be some talented fortune [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=127.44000000000001s)]
*  teller. I'm not. If you just read the language of the Supreme Court order, that order said, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=132.64s)]
*  and I'm quoting from it, that any directive the lower court came up with would have to give due [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=137.92s)]
*  regard to the executive branches, exclusive authorities over foreign affairs. The Supreme [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=142.88s)]
*  Court essentially said to the lower court, go back, tell the administration how to facilitate [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=148.32s)]
*  this return if you dare or if you can, if you can find a way to make the administration do it. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  The administration knew that from reading the language. They could just sit back and say, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=159.84s)]
*  hey, we've done everything we can. And their position is we view the word facilitate as [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=164.08s)]
*  removing all domestic obstacles. So if he happened to make it back here to Cleveland, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=169.6s)]
*  we would have no problem taking him. But now that he's in El Salvador, there is nothing we [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=174.88s)]
*  can do because, as Rubio said, this is infringing on the area, the exclusive executive area of [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  foreign affairs. And just one little footnote here, too, there's been much reporting and [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=186.24s)]
*  correctly that the government admitted this was a mistake. But keep in mind, that will not be the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  administration's party line because the attorney for the government who said that, the administration [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=196.8s)]
*  has essentially disavowed this person. They put him on administrative leave for not zealously [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  representing the government. Pam Bondi's words, not mine. So while it's true, the government [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=209.44s)]
*  admitted that Garcia was removed improperly due to an administrative error. Don't expect the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=214.96s)]
*  administration to carry on with that position. They've already distanced themselves from it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=221.20000000000002s)]
*  They believe they don't believe they're disregarding a court order. They believe they're [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=225.52s)]
*  acting consistent with it. Absolutely. And Dave Ehrenberg, you had the president with the president [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=229.52s)]
*  of El Salvador right there going, nope, I'm not going to send him back. And the president's job, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=234.72s)]
*  you tell me, in terms of trying to follow the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, President Trump's job is done [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=241.12s)]
*  because he sat right next to the president of El Salvador and said, I'm not sending him back. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=249.12s)]
*  Therefore, any attempt to facilitate his return ends with the president of El Salvador, does it not? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=253.76s)]
*  Well, that's what they're trying to say, Mika, but it's obvious that President Bukele would have [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=261.76s)]
*  this individual on the next flight home in first class if Trump demanded it. Judge Zinnis was right, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=266.16s)]
*  the district court judge. You don't rid yourself of constitutional responsibilities of due process by [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=271.28000000000003s)]
*  outsourcing your detention. And we're actually paying El Salvador to lock these folks up. And [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=276.64000000000004s)]
*  Kristi Noem, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said this is a tool in our [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=282.08000000000004s)]
*  toolkit. So if it is one of our tools, we can fix the problem. I don't think we're in a constitutional [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=288.0s)]
*  crisis yet, though, Mika, because the administration is playing games with the interpretation of federal [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=293.2s)]
*  court rules, but they're not outwardly defying federal judges. No one's been held in contempt [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=298.64s)]
*  yet. Trump has said he will respect the decisions of the Supreme Court. So instead of refusing to [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=302.8s)]
*  comply, what they're doing is trying to twist the Supreme Court's words to make it a victory for [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=307.84s)]
*  themselves, when it really wasn't. But as Danny correctly said, the Supreme Court is partly to [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=312.48s)]
*  blame here. They could have ordered Abrego Garcia's return, but they did not. They softened Judge [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=317.28s)]
*  Zinnis's language. They took out the word effectuate, and they said, let's facilitate the return. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=322.24s)]
*  And this is because Chief Justice Roberts wanted unanimity. He wanted Clarence Thomas and Alito and [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=327.76s)]
*  the other conservatives to join with the progressive in a 9-0 ruling. He got it. But in so doing, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=333.2s)]
*  he has made things worse. And the word facilitate is so important there, as both of our legal [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=338.88s)]
*  experts have pointed out. But it is stunning, Chris, when you see in the Oval Office, you've [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=344.64s)]
*  got the Attorney General, Pam Bondi, using that word facilitate in front of the president of [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=349.2s)]
*  El Salvador, saying, it's up to them if they want to send them back. She even says, we'll send a [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=353.76s)]
*  plane and facilitate it. And then you've got the president of El Salvador saying, what am I going [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=358.0s)]
*  to do, smuggle him back into the United States? They're talking past each other, and it seems [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=362.32s)]
*  purposeful. Mika alluded to the political realities here. What are they, as you see them? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=366.71999999999997s)]
*  Why didn't the press, who were present, ask the president, why don't you ask them to send them back? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=371.36s)]
*  They asked the questions about the way they were talking about the courts. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=376.71999999999997s)]
*  Oh, asking the president of El Salvador to send them back, and then there would be no question [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=380.08s)]
*  about smuggling him back into the country. That whole language was, as you said, talking past each [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=384.47999999999996s)]
*  other. You know, this whole thing, Mika, I think this whole discussion of the border has changed [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=389.91999999999996s)]
*  so dramatically from the election. The New York Times reported the two reasons Trump won. The two [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=395.36s)]
*  reasons was he talked about inflation and he talked about the border. We haven't talked about [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=401.76s)]
*  the border being closed since he got in office. The country is reasonable. They want the border [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=407.28000000000003s)]
*  closed. They want to stop people coming into the country illegally. They want people coming in with [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=413.12s)]
*  permission from the United States government to come in the country. But also, they seem to want [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=416.88s)]
*  to get people who've actually broke the laws in this country. Two laws, break the law coming in [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=421.36s)]
*  and then break the law here in terms of criminality here. In this case, the issues come down to [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=427.04s)]
*  something that's right on the border. People don't want somebody's punished who isn't committing a [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=431.84000000000003s)]
*  crime, who's not in a gang, who's not a dangerous gang. And so I think the country's still at a [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=436.0s)]
*  reasonable position. Close the border, go after criminals, but don't go after people who are [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=441.44s)]
*  innocent. I hope you're right, Chris. I'm not sure, Molly. Well, we're not complaining about [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=446.16s)]
*  the border. Nobody's complaining. I haven't heard a pipsqueak from anybody, any of the organized [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=454.64s)]
*  groups, to say we shouldn't have closed the border. The public wanted the border closed. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=459.68s)]
*  I just want to point out this Quinnipiac poll that was released last night, which shows that now the [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=464.71999999999997s)]
*  majority of Americans now disapprove of Trump on the deportations, 53 to 42. So I think that is a [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=471.03999999999996s)]
*  big deal. Okay, yeah. Well, because they think he's administratively wrong, because they think they're [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=478.8s)]
*  taking people who are not criminals out of the country. I've just been so disappointed. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=484.48s)]
*  But this is a real case of squandering, right? There was some agreement with Trump, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=490.72s)]
*  but not for this. And I think that's a really important point here, right? And we saw this [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=496.0s)]
*  even in the polls leading up to the election, right? They were okay with some of this, but not [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=502.16s)]
*  this kind of radical behavior. And that's what we're seeing. Yeah, I agree. I hope that Americans [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=508.15999999999997s)]
*  see the value in caring about this and these videos that they made of these hundreds of men [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=516.96s)]
*  who were chained and sent out of this country and put into a notorious mega prison in El Salvador. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=525.36s)]
*  I hope that they can connect with it. We will see. And maybe those numbers [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=531.76s)]
*  bear that out from politics back to the law. Danny, where does this go next? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=538.8s)]
*  I think this road could be leading to contempt. And what I also think, and I don't know that any [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=544.08s)]
*  federal judge will be candid about it, but I think there are a lot of federal judges who don't want [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=548.96s)]
*  this to go down the road of contempt, because that raises a really thorny issue of who do you hold in [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=553.6s)]
*  contempt in the chain of command? Because every human being in the administration's chain of [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=558.88s)]
*  command can say, I was ordered to do it except one person. And that person is at the top of the chain [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=564.48s)]
*  of command. So if you're a judge, whether it's a Supreme Court or a district court judge, and you [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=571.04s)]
*  find that someone has acted in contempt in this administration and their reading of the order is [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=575.52s)]
*  wrong, who do you punish? That may be the next tricky constitutional issue. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Qf6OyJopI&t=580.96s)]
