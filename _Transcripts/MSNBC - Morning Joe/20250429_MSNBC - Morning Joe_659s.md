# 'Trust in President Trump': WH press secretary responds to questions of economic volatility
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8)
*  Welcome back. A little before 9 o'clock in the Eastern time, we're going live to the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=0.0s)]
*  White House. That's press secretary Karen Levitt with Treasury Secretary Scott Besson [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=5.0s)]
*  marking President Trump's 100th day in office talking in particular about his economic record, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=9.8s)]
*  the impact of tariffs, and news from Amazon that they're going to be posting. As you purchase [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  an item on their website, they will post a fraction of the cost that's due to tariffs. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=19.16s)]
*  We will see in dollar amounts what the tariffs are costing you. Obviously, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=25.32s)]
*  White House not happy about that. Let's listen in. As Caroline said, the big tax on consumers that [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=30.2s)]
*  goes unnoticed is deregulation or regulation, and we are deregulating and bringing that down. So, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=36.2s)]
*  you know, from a household income point of view, we would expect real purchasing increases. We've [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  seen them over the first 100 days, and we would expect that to accelerate. We are doing peace [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=50.2s)]
*  deals, trade deals, tax deals, and deregulating. And the deregulation is a longer lead time, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=56.0s)]
*  but I think by the third and fourth quarters, that's really going to kick in. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=64.68s)]
*  Thank you, Caroline. A question for you and Secretary Besson. We talk a lot about volatility [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=68.28s)]
*  and uncertainty in the marketplace, and the President has stated all along that he's more [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=75.68s)]
*  concerned about mainstream America, the American worker. You just talked about deregulation and [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=79.64s)]
*  this entire fair trade and reciprocals. What is your message to the American people in terms of [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=85.12s)]
*  letting them get through this disturbance and the outcome being greater and a greater good for the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  American worker, the American people, the American families? I would say trust in President Trump. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  There is a reason he was reelected to this office. It's because of the historic success of his [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=105.76s)]
*  economic formula in the first term. And as I laid out at the beginning of the briefing and the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=110.28s)]
*  Secretary has talked about, and the President talks about every day, there's a proven formula [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=114.68s)]
*  that works. Massive deregulation, energy independence, and tax cuts which are coming. And the Secretary [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=119.16s)]
*  is working very hard on that with our counterparts on Capitol Hill. If you want to talk about that, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=126.04s)]
*  that's a huge deal to put more money back into the pockets of hardworking Americans. As for the fair [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=131.04000000000002s)]
*  trade deals the President is trying to negotiate, he's not just righting the wrong of the mess that [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=137.44s)]
*  he inherited from the past four years of the Biden administration. This is a mess that has been created [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=141.76000000000002s)]
*  for the past four decades that has sold out the middle class, that has moved jobs overseas. You [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=146.16s)]
*  think about our heartland, middle America, what towns used to look like, what they look like today. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=151.28s)]
*  President Trump wants to restore the golden age and it's a process to do that. And that process [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=155.76000000000002s)]
*  is underway but he's put together a fantastic trade team. Secretary Besant, Secretary Lutnick, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=160.32s)]
*  James and Greer all working incredibly hard on this effort 24-7. But tax cuts are coming and [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=164.95999999999998s)]
*  that's key. And Mr. Secretary, why don't you talk a little bit about that? Yeah, so it's really a [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=170.95999999999998s)]
*  three-legged stool in the economic policy. It's trade, it's tax, and it's deregulation. So we are [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=176.16s)]
*  in the midst of addressing, as Caroline said, these long-term trade imbalances. The tax bill [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=184.0s)]
*  is going much better than I would have thought when I took office on January 28th. And that's [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=191.68s)]
*  through President Trump's leadership that Speaker Johnson, Leader Thune are united. Speaker Johnson, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=199.28s)]
*  we had a very good meeting yesterday with somebody called the Big Six, NEC Director Kevin Haass [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=207.12s)]
*  it, myself, Speaker Johnson, Leader Thune, Committee Chairman Jason Smith, and Senator Crepo. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=213.92s)]
*  And the tax bill is moving forward. It is going to give permanence to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Job Act, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=221.04s)]
*  which will go back to the question on certainty. It will give American business certainty, it will [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=229.51999999999998s)]
*  give American people certainty. And then President Trump is also adding the things for working [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=234.16s)]
*  Americans that I talked about earlier, no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=241.6s)]
*  making auto payments deductible. So that will substantially address the affordability crisis. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=248.16s)]
*  And the other thing that I would note, and back to data, is that Vanguard, one of the largest [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=255.04s)]
*  money management firms in America, said that over the past 100 days, 97 percent of Americans [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=263.28s)]
*  haven't done a trade. And in fact, individual investors have held tight while institutional [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=269.92s)]
*  investors have panicked. So individual investors trust, individual investors trust President Trump. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=276.56s)]
*  Megan, in the back. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=286.88s)]
*  Can you detail for us exactly what we should expect as far as relief on the auto tariffs front? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=289.92s)]
*  And then further, Mr. Secretary, should we expect other industries to also get relief [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=294.48s)]
*  the way we've now seen for auto and tech as well? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=298.64s)]
*  I'm not going to go into the details of the auto tariff relief, but I can tell you that it will go [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=302.0s)]
*  substantially toward reshoring American auto manufacturing. And again, the goal here is to [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=309.68s)]
*  bring back the high quality industrial jobs to the U.S. President Trump is interested in the jobs [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=317.84s)]
*  of the future, not the jobs of the past. We don't need to necessarily have a booming textile [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=325.92s)]
*  industry like where I grew up again, but we do want to have precision manufacturing and bring that [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=333.28000000000003s)]
*  back. And another important, very important function of this that does not get talked about [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=338.96000000000004s)]
*  enough is national security. President Trump, his overriding concern and belief is that economic [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=345.04s)]
*  security is national security, national security is economic security. And we saw during COVID [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=355.44s)]
*  that our supply chains got cut off and we need to bring back a lot of those supply chains, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=362.08s)]
*  whether it's in semiconductors, medicines, the steel, and we have to onshore those. So it's a [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=368.08s)]
*  combination of making trade free and fair and remedying this gaping national security hole that [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=375.76s)]
*  he was left with. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=382.88s)]
*  And if I could, I would just add, Megan, the President will sign the executive order on auto [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=384.08s)]
*  tariffs later today and we will release it as we always do. Go ahead. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=388.4s)]
*  Secretary, any update on the negotiation with the European Union and is it hard to negotiate [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=391.36s)]
*  with the European Union? Do you have any updates on the negotiation with the European Union? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=397.12s)]
*  I'm more involved in the Asian negotiations. My observation would be, goes all the way back to [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=403.84s)]
*  Henry Kissinger's statement, when I call Europe, who do I call? So we're negotiating with a lot of [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=410.32s)]
*  different interests. Some of the European countries have put on an unfair digital service tax on our [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=416.24s)]
*  big Internet provider, France and Italy, other countries, Germany and Poland don't have that. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=423.04s)]
*  So we want to see that unfair tax of one of America's great industries removed. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=429.2s)]
*  So it's going to be a give and take. So they have some internal matters to decide before they can [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=436.8s)]
*  engage in an external negotiation. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=443.12s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, so contacts I have in the business community say that they're basically frozen for [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=446.32000000000005s)]
*  long term investment because of the uncertainty around tariffs. How long do you think President [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=450.96000000000004s)]
*  Trump has to make a deal before there's damage to the economy? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=455.36s)]
*  I think that what we're seeing is that business leaders, they've gone into a pause and I think [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=459.92s)]
*  we're going to give them great certainty on this tax bill. And I think over the next couple of [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=466.24s)]
*  weeks, as I said, we have 18 important trading relationships. We'll put China to the side, 17. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=472.32s)]
*  They are in motion. And then, as I said yesterday, I think there's a very good chance we're going to [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=479.44s)]
*  get this tax bill done. And the tax bill is going to be very powerful for domestic US investment. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=485.04s)]
*  So what we are going to do, one of the most powerful parts of President Trump's 2017 tax bill [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=491.6s)]
*  was full expensing of equipment. We are going to make that, as President Trump said in his speech [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=498.24s)]
*  to Congress, that will be retroactive to January 20th. The other thing that we are looking to add [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=504.32000000000005s)]
*  is full expensing for factories. So bring your factory back. You can fully expense the equipment [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=511.04s)]
*  and the building. We will couple that with deregulation, cheap energy and regulatory certainty. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=518.48s)]
*  And that will continue to make the US the greatest destination for domestic and foreign investment. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=526.1600000000001s)]
*  The President said that world leaders would like to meet with him in Rome, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=533.52s)]
*  in Vatican City, I'm sorry, about trade. Other than President Zelensky, who did the President meet with [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=536.72s)]
*  and about trade? And when could we get some of those deals? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=542.48s)]
*  The President met with President Zelensky, as you know, which we talked about, and the President [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=546.72s)]
*  continues to be engaged with his fellow foreign leaders, fellow leaders around the world in the [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=550.88s)]
*  European Union. You've seen many of them visit the White House. I want to harp on, in closing, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=556.5600000000001s)]
*  the point the Secretary just made. On the campaign trail, the President promised the American public [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=561.12s)]
*  that he was going to make America the best country in the world to do business again, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=566.0s)]
*  with the lowest taxes, lowest regulation, lowest energy costs of anywhere in the world. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=569.6800000000001s)]
*  And if you do business in the United States, you won't pay a tariff, you won't pay a price. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=573.84s)]
*  That's not just good for companies around the world, but it's good for the American worker. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=578.0s)]
*  That's what this team is focused so hard on every day. We have work to do. The golden age of America [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=581.9200000000001s)]
*  is underway. But as I pointed out in the beginning, there's a lot of reason for the American consumer, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=587.2s)]
*  the American CEO, the American small business owner to be confident and optimistic about this [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=592.72s)]
*  President and where we're headed. So you will hear more from the President himself later this [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=597.52s)]
*  evening. He is traveling to Michigan, as you all know. He'll make a stop at the Air Force base with [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=602.4s)]
*  Governor Whitmer, and then we will head to a rally tonight where you'll hear more from him directly. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=606.88s)]
*  So we'll see you in Michigan. Thank you, guys. We were just listening to Caroline Levitt, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=612.72s)]
*  the White House press secretary and Treasury Secretary Scott Besson, talking about the [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=618.0799999999999s)]
*  President's first hundred days, particularly the economic policy, fielding a lot of questions [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=621.4399999999999s)]
*  about tariffs, concerns, lack of trade deals, and they there did not answer [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=626.64s)]
*  whether or not any deals were close. We know that no deals are not yet done. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRjyxpHDu8&t=633.1999999999999s)]
