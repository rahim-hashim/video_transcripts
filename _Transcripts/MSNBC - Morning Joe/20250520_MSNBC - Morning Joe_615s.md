# 'Friends without benefits': No end in sight to war in Ukraine after Trump/Putin phone call
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM)
*  We're going to be talking, Mika, of course, off the top of the show about the two-hour phone call [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=0.0s)]
*  that President Trump had with Vladimir Putin and not a lot of movement towards a ceasefire. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=4.72s)]
*  The president said afterwards that there were some positive steps forward, but there is no doubt the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=14.32s)]
*  biggest problem right now is that Vladimir Putin doesn't want peace, doesn't want a ceasefire, and [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=23.76s)]
*  as Marco Rubio said a month or two ago, he said we're going to know very soon who's responsible [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  for the continued war. Over that last month, month and a half, Vladimir Putin has made certain the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=39.2s)]
*  world knows it is on him. He does not want peace. He doesn't want a ceasefire. He doesn't want [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=47.04s)]
*  anything to do with the end of this war. President Trump held this hours-long phone call with Vladimir [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=54.160000000000004s)]
*  Putin yesterday, and Trump posted on social media afterwards that he believed the call went very [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=61.2s)]
*  well and called for direct negotiations between Russia and Ukraine toward a ceasefire and an end [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=66.4s)]
*  to the war. Trump wrote those terms will now be negotiated directly between the two countries [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=73.28s)]
*  themselves. Putin, for his part, was quoted as telling Russian media the phone call was very [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=79.36s)]
*  informative and very open. Later in the day, in the Oval Office, President Trump spoke to reporters [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=85.19999999999999s)]
*  about the call. Mr. President, on Ukraine and on your call today that you had with President Putin, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  you said last week that you thought nothing was going to happen, no advances would be made until [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=98.0s)]
*  you and Putin got together. Do you still feel that way? I think something's going to happen. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=101.92s)]
*  It's a very big egos involved, I tell you. Big egos involved, but I think something's going to [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=107.68s)]
*  happen. And if it doesn't, I just back away and they're going to have to keep going. Again, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=114.64s)]
*  this was a European situation. It should have remained a European situation. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=119.76s)]
*  But I did say it's time. You got to stop this thing. And I believe he wants to stop. Look, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=126.0s)]
*  I would be, I think, very able to tell whether or not he wanted to or what. I thought there was a [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=132.8s)]
*  very good chance, like a 50-50 chance, that he would say, I want to take the whole thing. I didn't [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=138.08s)]
*  know what he was going to say. And then they have a different kind of a problem. But I believe he [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=145.04s)]
*  wants to stop. You mentioned that you believe Putin wants peace, but he just attacked Ukraine [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=149.92s)]
*  yesterday. So what makes you think that he wants peace? Well, he's in a war. You know, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=157.83999999999997s)]
*  nobody said don't. They're fighting. They're attacking. They're attacking each other. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=162.56s)]
*  And people are dying all the time. He's in a war. He's fighting a war. Nobody said he was [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=167.76s)]
*  going to stop. I think, is it terrible? Yeah, it's terrible. I do. I think it's terrible. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=172.48s)]
*  Well, President Trump spoke on on one with Ukrainian President Zelensky prior to his call [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=176.88s)]
*  with Putin and again afterwards in a conference call with other NATO leaders. In a briefing [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=182.48s)]
*  yesterday, Zelensky acknowledged Trump's call for direct negotiations between Ukraine and Russia. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=188.23999999999998s)]
*  However, he said Ukraine is still considering another high-level round of talks between American, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=194.79999999999998s)]
*  Russian and European officials. And Joe, I think that the lead out of all of that was [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=200.56s)]
*  President Trump hinting that if it continues, he'll back away and they'll keep going. That's [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=206.16s)]
*  a far cry from him saying he could end this in a day. Well, I think several things came out of it. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=213.52s)]
*  The first thing that came out of it was that he said it was positive talks are going to continue. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=220.56s)]
*  He thinks the two should get together and talk more specifically. Also said that he thought that [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=225.92s)]
*  Vladimir Putin did want peace, but the war, of course, still going on. And the question is, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=231.2s)]
*  of course, whether in fact that is the case or not. And if he does want peace, Vladimir Putin [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=238.79999999999998s)]
*  will not want peace out of the goodness of his heart. He'll want peace because, well, first of [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=244.39999999999998s)]
*  all, there's the economic drain with not only this war and sanctions, also the price of oil [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=249.28s)]
*  plunging the way it has. And of course, the casualties that just keep piling up. I suspect [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=257.12s)]
*  he even knows that continuing this war in the same manner that it's been fought over the past [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=264.88s)]
*  two years is just not possible for either side. But again, right now, the negotiations continue. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=270.24s)]
*  To talk about that, let's bring in NBC News Chief International Correspondent Keir Simmons from Dubai, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=278.72s)]
*  also retired U.S. Army Lieutenant General Mark Hurdling. His military career spans more than [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=283.84000000000003s)]
*  three decades of service, including as a commanding general of U.S. Army Europe and the Seventh Army. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=288.96000000000004s)]
*  Keir, let's begin with you. What can you tell us about the call yesterday and Russia's response? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=296.08000000000004s)]
*  Well, Joe, just to underscore what you've been saying, here's the point. President Putin does [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=302.16s)]
*  want the war to stop on his terms. That's what he said again and again. He walked out of that call [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=306.88s)]
*  yesterday, went straight in front of the cameras, Russian state media, and said it again. We want [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=313.68s)]
*  our core interests to be addressed. The root causes, he calls it. By that, he means he doesn't want [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=319.52000000000004s)]
*  it. By that, he means he doesn't want Ukraine any closer to Europe. He doesn't want Ukraine. He [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=327.92s)]
*  wants Ukraine to be mostly neutral. All those things we've heard again and again, that call [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=333.6s)]
*  that President Trump had with President Putin did not change that. President Trump says that he is, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=338.48s)]
*  that he may back away. He's already backing away. He was said just days ago that the only way to [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=345.92s)]
*  solve this was a face-to-face meeting between him and President Putin. Now, apparently, that isn't [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=353.12s)]
*  going to happen for some time while there are direct talks between Russia and Ukraine. President [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=357.12s)]
*  Zelensky and the Europeans are very, very worried about a particular question. What does backing [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=363.36s)]
*  away mean by President Trump? Does that backing away mean that he just leaves the negotiations to [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=370.24s)]
*  Russia and Ukraine? Does backing away mean that he withdraws again intelligence support for Ukraine, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=376.71999999999997s)]
*  this kind of security support that the Europeans just can't provide? Now, this is a very fast-moving, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=384.4s)]
*  complicated picture. There are a lot of things happening. There's a bill in Congress that [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=390.4s)]
*  Secretary of State Rubio said over the weekend the White House is not able to prevent the progress of [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=395.76s)]
*  the deal. The White House approved the moving of missile defense systems to Ukraine just in the [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=402.4s)]
*  past few weeks. What President Trump says and what's actually happening, just like in his first term, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=412.0s)]
*  are not necessarily the same. In some ways, we're seeing a repeat of that first term. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=420.08s)]
*  The bromance is back on. What the Russians said about the call was that President Putin began [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=424.32s)]
*  by congratulating President Trump on the birth of his grandchild, that they called each other by [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=430.0s)]
*  their first names, that they didn't want the call to end. The two presidents wanted to just keep [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=434.64s)]
*  going. So all very friendly, but no prize. Friends with no benefits, if you like. And that is a repeat, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=439.28s)]
*  frankly, of what the Russians think happened in the first term, which was that they seemed to have [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=448.88s)]
*  a great relationship between their presidents, but didn't get any kind of resolution in the [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=454.48s)]
*  relationship with the United States. So we are no further forward. President Putin has not shifted. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=460.0s)]
*  Despite Steve Witkoff saying over the weekend that the force of President Trump's personality would [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=469.68s)]
*  shift the logjam, was his words. That didn't happen on the call yesterday. And I think [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=475.36s)]
*  the historians may look back on this moment and say this was the moment that the US did begin to [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=482.72s)]
*  step back. It's interesting to hear Steve Witkoff talk. He will say, well, it's a really complicated [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=489.6s)]
*  war. It's very difficult to solve, you think? It's very similar to what he says about Gaza. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=497.44s)]
*  It's really complicated. It's really hard to stop that war, even though that was his role. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=504.96s)]
*  There are still hostages being held. And now, of course, Steve Witkoff is moving on to negotiate [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=512.0s)]
*  the Iran deal. So I think we're clearer at this stage, honestly, when you look past the rhetoric [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=517.36s)]
*  about where things stand. I think the war continues. There's no sign of a ceasefire. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=524.88s)]
*  And both the Russians and Ukrainians will continue to work to try to get what they want from the [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=531.2s)]
*  White House, while certainly the Russians and to some extent the Ukrainians believe they can still [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=536.8s)]
*  gain if the conflict continues. Because the Russians think they're winning, even though [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=544.4799999999999s)]
*  there's not a doubt about that when you actually look at the battlefield. And the Ukrainians think [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=553.4399999999999s)]
*  that over time, the Russians will begin to struggle to supply more troops to the military, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=557.1999999999999s)]
*  more recruits to the military. So far, they're really able to still funnel troops to the military. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=564.48s)]
*  But that may not be the case in years to come. It's going to take some time, though. It's [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=568.96s)]
*  bitterly disappointing, honestly, for anyone who would hope to see peace in Ukraine. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=574.72s)]
*  Friends without benefits. Many things have been said of the Putin-Trump relationship. Keir, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=580.88s)]
*  you added one to the top of the list. Friends without benefits. Keir Simmons, thank you so much. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=587.76s)]
*  Greatly appreciated. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpilqP7NvBM&t=594.0s)]
