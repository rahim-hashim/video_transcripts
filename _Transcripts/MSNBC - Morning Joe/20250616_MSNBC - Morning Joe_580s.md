# 'Dumbest tweet of the day': Senator slammed for posts about Minnesota shooting suspect
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk)
*  Well, one politician, and I will say a man that I've known and in the past have had a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=0.0s)]
*  good relationship and liked him like a self-spoken man, but somebody that posted this weekend, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=7.38s)]
*  Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah, obviously facing strong criticism for a social media [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=15.4s)]
*  post about the Minnesota shooting suspect. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  Yesterday, Lee posted a picture of the suspect at the door of one of the lawmakers with the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=23.68s)]
*  caption, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=27.92s)]
*  This is what happens when Marxists don't get their way. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=28.92s)]
*  It is a pinned tweet at the top of his page. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=31.680000000000003s)]
*  Twenty-five minutes later, the Senator posted another picture of the society shooter with [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=35.84s)]
*  the caption, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=40.52s)]
*  Nightmare on Wall Street. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=41.52s)]
*  Mocking, of course, the situation with the name of the Minnesota governor. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  But those posts came hours before Lee tweeted a Happy Father's Day message. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  Conservative journalist Brad Palumbo responded to one of the posts writing, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=57.6s)]
*  Quote, what the hell is Mike Lee doing? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=61.080000000000005s)]
*  Has he completely lost it? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=63.400000000000006s)]
*  Meanwhile, contributing editor for the Atlantic, Norm Ornstein wrote, even for Mike Lee, this [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=64.92s)]
*  is beyond disgusting, disinformation beneath contempt. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  We're used to, Senator, we're used to wackos on the extremes on both sides, posting bizarre [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=75.72s)]
*  things on social media. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=83.5s)]
*  What happens when it's mainstreamed by a senator? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=85.9s)]
*  Again, a guy that I've known and who used to try to be a thoughtful, conservative voice [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=88.86s)]
*  for small government conservatism when he starts posting things like this. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=97.86000000000001s)]
*  What's the United States Senate's answer to that? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=104.06s)]
*  I only ask that because I can tell you, back in my days, I guess in the Stone Age it is [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=106.14000000000001s)]
*  now, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=111.26s)]
*  I mean, a senator on either side would have been roundly condemned by members of his or [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=112.26s)]
*  her own party if they had done this. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=117.66000000000001s)]
*  I have condemned what Mike Lee did here at home, and I will speak to him about this when [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=121.94s)]
*  I return. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=127.66000000000001s)]
*  And what I'm going to tell him is, you know, this isn't funny what happened here. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=128.66s)]
*  This was an incredible woman, her husband, her two kids yesterday on Father's Day. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=132.86s)]
*  There was no Father's Day for them. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=138.86s)]
*  They lost both their parents. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=140.24s)]
*  I'll tell him about the law enforcement that did incredible work here. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=142.60000000000002s)]
*  We had a 43-hour manhunt, the biggest manhunt in Minnesota's history, hundreds and hundreds [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=147.10000000000002s)]
*  of officers, 20 SWAT teams going door to door to door, citizens on edge, hiding in their [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=152.54000000000002s)]
*  homes. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=159.84s)]
*  And they finally were able to arrest this man who was armed, but there was not a shooting, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=160.84s)]
*  and bring him into custody and did their jobs. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=166.92000000000002s)]
*  And by the way, if the police had not on their own decided to go over to Representative Hortman's [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=170.6s)]
*  home without a call because of what they noticed, of course, had happened, the tragedy at Senator [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=175.2s)]
*  Hoffman's house, they thought, well, maybe we should check this out. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=180.83999999999997s)]
*  Well, they weren't able to prevent the deaths. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=183.92s)]
*  They were able to identify the suspect because he ran out and his car was left there. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=186.95999999999998s)]
*  Otherwise, more people would have been killed. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=192.39999999999998s)]
*  So that's what I'm going to tell Senator Lee when I get back to Washington today, because [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=194.73999999999998s)]
*  this is not a laughing matter. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=200.84s)]
*  And certainly what we're seeing in increasing violence and this evil man who did this, this [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=202.16s)]
*  is not a joke. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=208.28s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=210.28s)]
*  Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, thank you so much for being with us this morning. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=211.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=216.84s)]
*  And please send our thoughts and prayers and love to the families and the people of Minnesota. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=217.84s)]
*  I will do that. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=224.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=225.96s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=226.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=227.96s)]
*  Senator High, we obviously over the past several years, we've had the bludgeoning of Paul Pelosi, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=229.04000000000002s)]
*  two assassination attempts against Donald Trump, Josh Shapiro's governor's mansion, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=233.4s)]
*  attempted arson and parts of his home scorched. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=238.96s)]
*  Then these assassinations in Minnesota. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=243.60000000000002s)]
*  Is there any thought among leaders on Capitol Hill and also in the administration throughout [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=245.86s)]
*  the country on how to curb this political violence? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=252.16s)]
*  I don't think there is, right? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=256.1s)]
*  I think you nailed it, right? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=258.08s)]
*  The fact that you have a sitting U.S. senator tweeting out such jackassery, right? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=259.79999999999995s)]
*  People were killed. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=267.0s)]
*  There was a manhunt ongoing. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=268.0s)]
*  And a U.S. senator thought that the best use of his time was to mock, was to accuse it [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=270.32s)]
*  of being part of an ideological plant. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=278.0s)]
*  And the fact that that's normalized, that there wasn't more of a response, shows that [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=282.03999999999996s)]
*  there's just no real solution coming from lawmakers. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=287.36s)]
*  And by the way, it is hitting liberals and conservatives. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=290.40000000000003s)]
*  Anybody who gets on social media understands algorithms, understands how they're meant [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=293.16s)]
*  to get you all hopped up on topics you're already hopped up about. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=298.16s)]
*  Eventually, you become disassociated, I think. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=301.56s)]
*  How else can you explain senators taunting or tweeting things that we might have done [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=304.92s)]
*  while you're drinking when we were 18? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=310.88s)]
*  You're a U.S. senator. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=312.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=315.16s)]
*  Jim, you and I got to the Hill about the same time you were a reporter, me as a member of [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=316.96000000000004s)]
*  Congress. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=322.16s)]
*  Can you just underline for everybody what I said, that let's say a Republican senator [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  had done something like this after a tragedy, how you would have had then-majority or minority [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=328.28000000000003s)]
*  leader Trent Light call them to their office, tear them to shreds rhetorically, and then [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=335.20000000000005s)]
*  they would be, you know, go to the floor and, you know, weep and apologize so they [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=342.72s)]
*  wouldn't be censured. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=350.0s)]
*  Same thing with the Democrats. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=351.12s)]
*  If a Democrat had done this, you would have seen the same thing happening. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=352.6s)]
*  I mean, and again, with Mike Lee, there's a guy again who, for the most part, was a [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=356.92s)]
*  soft-spoken guy, conservatives, conservatives, small government conservative. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=363.08000000000004s)]
*  I'm just curious. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=368.24s)]
*  I mean, how did we get here? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=369.92s)]
*  And talk about how radically things have changed since you first got to Washington on this [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=373.2s)]
*  score. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=377.8s)]
*  And we're asking this question because when this continues, the violence is sure to follow. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=380.12s)]
*  The thing is norms slip slowly than suddenly, right? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=387.88s)]
*  And I think the root cause here probably is social media as an outlet for any idea, any [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=391.72s)]
*  absurd thought that you have to be distributed at scale instantaneously. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=398.08s)]
*  The fact that the more provocative it is, the more likely you're going to get engagement [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=402.88s)]
*  creates kind of a mental, almost like a dopamine jolt when you get people applauding things [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=406.84s)]
*  no matter how silly the things are that you're saying. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=412.04s)]
*  And the only way you change that is what you're talking about is you somehow have to get back [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=415.48s)]
*  to the fact that you live in the same country. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=419.36s)]
*  You run in the same government. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=422.46s)]
*  You can have ideological differences and not taunt each other or accuse the other of the [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=424.34s)]
*  most awful atrocities. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=429.65999999999997s)]
*  You can do it. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=432.17999999999995s)]
*  It was done. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=433.17999999999995s)]
*  When you were in Congress, like you said, people would have been censured. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=434.17999999999995s)]
*  You literally would have been a vote on the House or Senate floor censuring you for your [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=436.94s)]
*  behavior and those votes almost never took place because there were norms that people [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=441.34s)]
*  stuck to. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=446.14s)]
*  And there's nothing soft about norms. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=447.14s)]
*  There's nothing whiny about norms. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=449.14s)]
*  You can have political debate. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=451.58s)]
*  You can have differences without doing what Senator Lee did. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=454.06s)]
*  And Senator Lee is not alone. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=457.82s)]
*  We're picking on him today because he had the dumbest tweet of the day. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=458.98s)]
*  But there's other lawmakers that do it all the time. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=463.1s)]
*  I even watch Democrats now responding to Republicans and it's almost like they're picking up the [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=465.22s)]
*  Trump habits, the amount of profanity, the amount of like taunting, the amount of making [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=469.62s)]
*  fun of people. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=474.9s)]
*  Like it feels good, but it doesn't really solve anything. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=476.18s)]
*  And I think that's why the American people wake up every day and they're just exhausted. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=480.3s)]
*  They're exhausted. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=483.3s)]
*  They don't know what to believe. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=484.3s)]
*  Think about this weekend. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=485.98s)]
*  I feel so bad for people who don't have to marinate in this crap all day. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=487.46000000000004s)]
*  How would you even know if the crowds were big this weekend or whether or not the shooter [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=491.14s)]
*  was a liberal or a conservative? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=495.82s)]
*  It depends what channel you went into. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=497.54s)]
*  It depends what social media feed you were into. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=500.18s)]
*  The amount of nonsense that was filtering out there. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=502.72s)]
*  And that's why I think a lot of people just say to hell with it. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=505.86s)]
*  I'm not going to pay attention to anything. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=507.86s)]
*  I'm going to go have a life and I'll let politics be politics and maybe I won't go vote and [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=509.26s)]
*  I won't demand that you return to those norms. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=513.82s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=515.98s)]
*  And you can say the same thing about what happened out in L.A. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=516.98s)]
*  If you're in one media ecosystem, then there were riots on every street corner in L.A. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=520.46s)]
*  and burning cars, you know, millions of burning cars, just absolute chaos. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=524.86s)]
*  If you were on the other side, it was like, you know, springtime and, you know, people [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=529.84s)]
*  handing daisies out to each other. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=534.0600000000001s)]
*  There was no sort of in between there. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=535.98s)]
*  Even Bill Maher said on Friday night just how frustrated he was that, you know, people [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=539.0600000000001s)]
*  on the hard right were trying to suggest that there were riots on every street. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=544.1s)]
*  He said there just wasn't. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=547.34s)]
*  It's just again, it's a skewed reality that that these people that are locked into one [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=549.14s)]
*  political ecosystem are seeing. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=555.02s)]
*  It was far more balanced than that. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot31E4JGglk&t=557.82s)]
