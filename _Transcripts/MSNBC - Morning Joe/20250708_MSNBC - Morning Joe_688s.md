# Dozens still missing in Texas as search for survivors continues
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [July 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk)
*  I need to tell my community and those families who are waiting this will be a rough week. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=0.0s)]
*  Primary search continues and we remain hopeful every foot, every mile, every bend of the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=8.52s)]
*  river. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=17.0s)]
*  The mayor of Kerrville, Texas, speaking to his community yesterday in the wake of the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  devastating flash flooding that swept through the region. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=23.8s)]
*  We're going to go through live to the hard hit area as the death toll continues to rise [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=27.96s)]
*  and questions mount about the warning systems there. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=33.08s)]
*  Plus, President Trump welcomes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=36.56s)]
*  We'll look at whether progress was made toward a ceasefire agreement in Gaza. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=42.44s)]
*  And the Trump administration is facing backlash this morning after a DOJ and FBI investigation [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=47.56s)]
*  found convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein did not have a client list. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=56.32s)]
*  We'll go through the right-wing anger toward the attorney general on that. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=62.76s)]
*  Good morning and welcome to Morning Joe. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=67.2s)]
*  It's Tuesday, July 8th, with Joe, Willie and me here. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=70.16s)]
*  And we start, Willie, this morning with the latest out of central Texas. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=74.48s)]
*  Yeah, good morning, guys. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=78.4s)]
*  The death toll, as you mentioned, Mika, from those devastating floods now has risen to [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=79.88s)]
*  more than 100 people across six counties. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=83.52s)]
*  The majority of those killed in storm-ravaged Kerr County, where local officials say 28 [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=86.6s)]
*  children are among the dead. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=91.6s)]
*  That county is where Camp Mystic is located, a beloved nearly century-old summer camp for girls. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=93.84s)]
*  Camp officials yesterday say they're grieving the loss of 27 campers and counselors following [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  the catastrophic flooding on the Guadalupe River. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  Ten girls and one counselor from the camp still missing this morning. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=107.75999999999999s)]
*  We're learning more as well about some of the victims of the deadly storm that swept [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=112.28s)]
*  through parts of the state. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=115.76s)]
*  Blair and Brook Harbor, just 11 and 13 years old, were vacationing with their family in [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=117.52000000000001s)]
*  Hunt, Texas, camping when pounding rain and floodwater ripped through the area. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=122.84s)]
*  When rescuers recovered their bodies on Saturday, the sisters were found with their hands locked [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=127.88000000000001s)]
*  together. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=133.20000000000002s)]
*  That's according to a relative. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=134.20000000000002s)]
*  Four days out now from those raging floods, rescue crews still not giving up on the search [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=135.8s)]
*  for survivors, continuing to comb through the region in their search. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=140.12s)]
*  But more rain is expected in central Texas over the coming days. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=144.20000000000002s)]
*  The National Weather Service extended some riverside flood watches and warnings through [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=147.72000000000003s)]
*  Thursday telling residents to remain vigilant. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=152.20000000000002s)]
*  And as some officials in Texas continue to criticize the National Weather Service in [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=156.96s)]
*  the aftermath of the fatal floods, an investigation by NBC Dallas-Fort Worth found the agency [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=161.56s)]
*  first issued a warning 12 hours ahead of the surging waters. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=169.88s)]
*  Troy Kimmel, an Austin-based meteorologist and emergency manager, told NBC he believes [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=173.68s)]
*  the Weather Service issued timely alerts with the best information available. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  The question remains, did those alerts reach the people who needed them the most? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=184.68s)]
*  Hard-hit Kerr County does not have a weather siren system, in part because some local [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=190.16s)]
*  officials felt it was too expensive to install. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=196.76s)]
*  The Weather Service says it added keywords to a late night warning to automatically trigger [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=199.8s)]
*  wireless alerts on cell phones and weather radios in the area. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=205.28s)]
*  But at Camp Mystic, where cell phones were not allowed or in other rural areas of the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=210.07999999999998s)]
*  county with limited service, many may not have received the alerts at all. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=217.6s)]
*  Meanwhile, one Texas town had something its nearby neighbors did not have. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=223.12s)]
*  Comfort, Texas, recently updated its disaster alert system, installing a new siren in the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=228.72s)]
*  Volunteer Fire Department's headquarters and moving the old one to a low-lying area of [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=235.04000000000002s)]
*  town. Friday was the first time using the new two-tiered siren system. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=240.72000000000003s)]
*  Officials say no one in comfort died as a result of the floods and perhaps it was the sirens. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=248.0s)]
*  Yeah, it may have been, especially since we're talking about something that happened in the [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=255.11999999999998s)]
*  middle of the night when people are sleeping and maybe not hearing an alert or seeing one [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=258.08s)]
*  on their phone. Let's go to Texas where we find NBC News Senior National Correspondent Jay Gray. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=262.08s)]
*  He is in Kerrville this morning. Jay, what's the latest there? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=267.28s)]
*  Jay, good morning, Willie, Mika, Joe. Let's start with that search, the rescue and the recovery. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=270.16s)]
*  It is still going on around the clock here. Hundreds of first responders on the ground and [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=280.16s)]
*  in the air. We're several hours away from sunrise here and we've already seen multiple choppers [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=287.36s)]
*  overhead using night vision. As you talk about, more than a hundred have died as a result of the [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=293.44000000000005s)]
*  storms here. That number expected to grow. And officials for the first time acknowledging [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=299.68s)]
*  they're not really sure how many are missing at this point. Saying, and I'm quoting here, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=305.6s)]
*  it's a lot. Dozens still missing as that search continues. I want to give you a look at some of [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=310.40000000000003s)]
*  the devastation left behind by these flood waters. The family, an elderly couple and their daughter [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=315.2s)]
*  who were in this home did manage to get out as the water rushed in mud coating everything inside. So [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=320.88s)]
*  they pulled what they can outside. And this is a scene replaying along the Guadalupe River right [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=326.96s)]
*  now. A lot of people trying to salvage anything they can from this wreckage. And really the pieces [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=333.2s)]
*  of so many lives scattered not only in the front and backyards of these homes, but for miles picked [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=340.47999999999996s)]
*  up by the water and pulled away. And this is a process that's going to continue for quite some [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=347.84s)]
*  time. They're again, trying to find anything they can in this wreckage. And when you look at all of [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=354.96s)]
*  this, you get a picture of what's going on here. And it really is hard to rationalize when these [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=361.76s)]
*  families are telling you with all that's been lost here, they're the lucky ones, but the perspective [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=370.15999999999997s)]
*  is real. They've seen what's been lost here and they are struggling right now, grieving as they [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=376.56s)]
*  begin to make the turn towards some type of recovery that's going to be difficult. They're [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=382.88s)]
*  going to need some help guys. Jay, so many of these stories have touched the country, specifically [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=387.6s)]
*  the ones coming out of Camp Mystic, that beloved summer camp for girls down on the banks of the [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=392.88s)]
*  river. We know that the director of the camp, the longtime director of the camp, Dick Eastland died [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=398.4s)]
*  trying to save some of these girls was swept away as well. What more do we know coming out of the [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=403.76s)]
*  camp about numbers and who they may still be looking for? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=408.56s)]
*  Yeah, we know that at least 10 campers as well as a counselor are still missing and so that's [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=415.2s)]
*  something that they are focused on here. And Willie, you make a great point. That camp's really an [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=421.6s)]
*  institution, not only here in the hill country, but across Texas. So many people have gone to [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=426.48s)]
*  that camp. It's a hundred years old and a lot of those who have been a part of the camp are [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=432.88s)]
*  returning. They're volunteering and trying to help and doing what they can, not only to help with [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=438.08s)]
*  the cleanup, with the recovery and with the camp itself, but with so many who survive there and [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=443.28s)]
*  trying to help them as they come to grips with what's happened and try to figure out how they're [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=449.84s)]
*  going to move forward. You know, Jay, obviously whenever hurricanes hit or any storms hit, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=456.48s)]
*  there are always the questions that we're hearing now. I mean, sort of questions, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=465.44s)]
*  what did the government do? How could they have done it better? I certainly heard it on the ground [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=469.84000000000003s)]
*  for Katrina asking those questions about a Republican president, a Democratic governor, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=474.48s)]
*  Democratic mayor. We heard it last year with Hurricane Helene and FEMA's response. I know [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=479.52000000000004s)]
*  you're on the ground day in, day out, talking to residents, talking to local officials, talking [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=486.0s)]
*  to healthcare workers. What are you hearing? What are the biggest questions right now that are [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=491.76s)]
*  arising in these first tragic days afterwards? What could government on all levels have done better? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=497.36s)]
*  Yeah, and Joe, I think you make some great points there. It is a frustration for so many here that [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=508.48s)]
*  there was not some type of warning system in place, that they did not have sirens, even though [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=513.52s)]
*  it was looked into by the council here and by so many across Kirk County. It just wasn't something [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=518.56s)]
*  they decided to do. And so that's very frustrating in light of all that's been lost. I have to be [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=524.88s)]
*  frank, while they do talk about that and while they do want to find answers for how to move forward, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=531.12s)]
*  I don't think for the most part the people here in the strike zone are focused on finding fault [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=538.4000000000001s)]
*  right now. They're way too busy. They've got to clean up areas like this. They've got to bury those [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=544.5600000000001s)]
*  who've been recovered, lost, and they've got to try and find those that are still missing. And so [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=550.4000000000001s)]
*  it's definitely an issue. It's definitely a problem. And there are questions about [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=555.12s)]
*  how the warning system worked and with areas that don't have cell service or where it's sketchy at [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=560.4000000000001s)]
*  best. There's got to be a better answer to all of this. But I'm going to be real honest, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=567.2s)]
*  right now that's not the primary focus. Of course not. NBC News Senior National [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=571.9200000000001s)]
*  correspondent Jay Gray reporting live this morning from Kerrville, Texas. Thank you so much. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=578.08s)]
*  We greatly appreciate it as always. And you know, Willie, those questions do come. They should come. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=583.5200000000001s)]
*  But as Jay said, right now we're in the middle of an active search. I will say the thing that seems [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=590.08s)]
*  to stand out the most right now obviously is the decision not to spend about $50,000 on an early [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=597.76s)]
*  warning system for the area most grievously hit just because they believe $50,000 was too expensive. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=604.4000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, there are a lot of those stories coming out in the details about warnings given or not given. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=617.28s)]
*  And to these people camping on the banks of this river, to those sweet girls and the staff [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=622.24s)]
*  at Camp Mystic, those questions will all be asked and investigated and perhaps some things [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=627.76s)]
*  will change because of it. But I'm sure you too, Joe, have heard personal stories from people the [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=632.3199999999999s)]
*  way I have too. We've got friends in Dallas and Houston and all over the place who either had kids [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=637.6s)]
*  there or kids who used to go there or they were counselors there and what a special place this was [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=642.56s)]
*  and how devastating obviously this is to the families who've lost children, those holding out [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=648.0s)]
*  some hope that their child may be found somehow, some way all these days later now. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=653.1199999999999s)]
*  It's just devastating and truly, truly heartbreaking. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=658.4s)]
*  you [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenLCpHnWCk&t=672.56s)]
