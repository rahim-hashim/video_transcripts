# House cracks down on fentanyl, passing bill elevating it to Schedule I drug
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs)
*  A group of top House Republicans met with the president at the White House yesterday [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=0.0s)]
*  to discuss plans for passing Trump's sweeping legislative agenda. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=4.24s)]
*  That meeting comes as the party appears divided over how to get a budget resolution across [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=10.22s)]
*  the finish line. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=15.32s)]
*  House Republicans have indicated a preference for passing a single bill that would include [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=16.96s)]
*  Trump's priorities on taxes, immigration, and energy. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  Senate Republicans appear to favor splitting up the issues into two bills. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=25.96s)]
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson had this to say to senators yesterday. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=30.36s)]
*  Our message to our friends and colleagues in the Senate is allow the House to do its [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=35.6s)]
*  work. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=39.84s)]
*  We are moving this as quickly and as expeditiously as possible. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=40.84s)]
*  Very positive developments today. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  We're really grateful to the president for leaning in and doing what he does best, and [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=45.8s)]
*  that is put a steady hand at the wheel and get everybody working. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=50.88s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Republican-led House passed the Halt Fentanyl Act yesterday with bipartisan [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=54.56s)]
*  support now classifying the opioid as a Schedule I controlled substance. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=60.440000000000005s)]
*  The bill would lead to harsher punishments for using or selling the drug. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=66.80000000000001s)]
*  It passed with a 312 to 108 vote, with 98 Democrats voting in favor. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=71.4s)]
*  An increase from the votes received for a similar act that was brought up during the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=76.76s)]
*  last Congress. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=82.36s)]
*  Let's bring in Republican Congressman Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania and House Republican [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=83.64s)]
*  Conference Chairwoman, Congresswoman Lisa McClain of Michigan. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=90.68s)]
*  We're going to get to the Halt Act in a minute. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=95.56s)]
*  First, Chairwoman McClain, you were at the White House yesterday for a meeting on President [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=97.36s)]
*  Trump's agenda, which you said was, quote, spirited at times. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=101.8s)]
*  I've been in a few spirited meetings regarding legislation. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=107.28s)]
*  What can you tell us about it? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=113.64s)]
*  What I can tell you about is we spent about five hours in the White House, and it is so [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  refreshing to have a leader in the White House that is engaging, that is crystal clear on [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=119.47999999999999s)]
*  his priorities and making sure that we as Republicans deliver on those promises that [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=126.08s)]
*  he made, whether it was the budget resolution, whether it was securing the border, getting [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=132.84s)]
*  the economy back on track. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=139.28s)]
*  It was spirited, no doubt, but that's what we're supposed to do, right? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=141.52s)]
*  Disagreement isn't disloyalty. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=145.92s)]
*  And when we have conversations, we do a better job. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  This piece of legislation, the reconciliation, is absolutely or could be absolutely transformational [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  when we get it right. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  So we have to pause just a minute to make sure that we are getting it right. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=161.56s)]
*  But I was honored to be there. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=166.88s)]
*  It was spirited. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=168.36s)]
*  And my goodness gracious, I've never met a president like President Trump that has so [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=169.8s)]
*  much energy. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=173.76000000000002s)]
*  Few people have ever met a president like President Trump. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=176.56s)]
*  I think even Democrats would say that. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=180.96s)]
*  Congresswoman, tell me, what is the strategy? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=183.60000000000002s)]
*  The House wants to pass the reconciliation bill in one piece of legislation, and the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=189.08s)]
*  senators are the House of Lords, as we always call them, want to divide it into two. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=196.56s)]
*  What is the difference in logic? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=202.32s)]
*  What's the difference in strategy? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=204.24s)]
*  Why do you think the House has it right? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=205.96s)]
*  Well, I think the House has it right because we want to make some pretty significant cuts. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=208.04s)]
*  Listen, we're $36 trillion in debt. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=214.48000000000002s)]
*  We have a spending problem. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=218.88s)]
*  We have to get our spending mechanism under control and reconciliation gives us a vehicle [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=220.68s)]
*  to do just that. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=227.16s)]
*  So we have to we want pay for us. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=229.76000000000002s)]
*  So the tax, some of the tax policies are going to cost some money. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=232.16s)]
*  We have to make sure that we can pay for them. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=236.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=239.04000000000002s)]
*  Border security to clean up the mess that President Biden left us at the border is going [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=240.04000000000002s)]
*  to take some money to do. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=244.28s)]
*  So if we put it in one big, beautiful bill, so to speak, we will have more money to get [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=246.4s)]
*  everything that we need done, done for the American people. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=251.48000000000002s)]
*  So Congressman, obviously, the border, illegal border crossings have dropped precipitously. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=256.36s)]
*  They've gotten much lower over the past year or two. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=264.72s)]
*  Same with fentanyl crossing the border. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=268.12s)]
*  That said, fentanyl is still such a huge problem in the United States. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=270.68s)]
*  Talk to any parent. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=275.38s)]
*  I'm a parent and so many parents so scared of that. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=277.36s)]
*  This fentanyl bill that was passed, I got to say, I'm surprised. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=282.02s)]
*  I had no idea it was a schedule to drug despite just the hell that it is visited on Americans [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=285.46s)]
*  and American families. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=295.18s)]
*  But this bill that passed with a bipartisan vote yesterday makes it a schedule one drug, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=296.98s)]
*  correct? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=302.94s)]
*  How does that help law enforcement? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=304.78s)]
*  Well I think first I appreciate you recognizing the crisis that we have relating to fentanyl. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=308.06s)]
*  And like you had mentioned, fentanyl doesn't discriminate between any socioeconomic background, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=313.5s)]
*  family dynamics. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=318.5s)]
*  I actually lost a 16-year-old cousin due to a fentanyl-related overdose. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=319.5s)]
*  And it was totally tragic and what I feel is preventable. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=325.1s)]
*  Two milligrams is enough to kill a human, which is like the size of an ant. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=329.5s)]
*  So when you start to talk about 43 pounds being apprehended at the northern border, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=334.3s)]
*  that's enough fentanyl to kill the population of the state of Ohio, almost 12 million people. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=339.74s)]
*  So we have to get serious about this crisis and we have to buckle down and protect the [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=345.1s)]
*  American people. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=348.9s)]
*  This was a bipartisan piece of legislation. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=351.34s)]
*  Democrats jumped on board. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=354.54s)]
*  Congressman, what other opportunities are there? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=356.38s)]
*  Because I know you guys hear it when you're back in your districts and Congressman, I [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=358.86s)]
*  know you're in a swing district and you've heard it too. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=363.54s)]
*  Americans do want both sides working together. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=368.14s)]
*  What are some more opportunities for that to happen this session of Congress? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=371.42s)]
*  I think everybody wants fiscal responsibility. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=377.22s)]
*  We hate seeing waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=379.82s)]
*  And you know what's really frustrating is when, like the Congresswoman said here, that [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=382.22s)]
*  when you have $36 trillion in debt and just the interest on that debt payment alone is [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=386.06s)]
*  more than our national defense budget, it certainly aids to some concern. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=390.78000000000003s)]
*  I mean, we're financing our great grandchildren's futures at this point. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=394.82s)]
*  Everybody wants jobs. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=398.9s)]
*  Everybody wants an economy that works. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=399.94s)]
*  They want secure borders and they want safe communities. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=401.26s)]
*  And I think our vote yesterday on Hall fentanyl was a first step in that right direction. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=403.64s)]
*  Congressman, let me ask you about that, about the $36 trillion debt. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=407.86s)]
*  I'm an old man. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=413.94s)]
*  When I was there, we were worried about a $4 trillion debt. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=415.26s)]
*  We did balance the budget four years in a row. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=419.18s)]
*  That required really tough choices. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=422.86s)]
*  I'm so glad to hear you talking about the need of if there are tax cuts, you know, there [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=426.34s)]
*  have to be pay-fors. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=432.18s)]
*  If there are other spending bills, there have to be pay-fors. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=434.0s)]
*  I guess CBO came out with the projection that the national debt is going to jump another [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=437.06s)]
*  $20 trillion in 10 years. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=441.9s)]
*  We can't afford that as a nation, can we? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=444.98s)]
*  Amen to that. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=448.46000000000004s)]
*  We can't. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=449.70000000000005s)]
*  And that's why in reconciliation, while we have this opportunity, we must make some tough [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=450.82s)]
*  decisions. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=458.16s)]
*  And my hope is that it is bipartisan, that like my colleague said, that we care about [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=459.48s)]
*  our grandkids and our great grandkids. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=465.42s)]
*  We have to make some tough decisions. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=468.1s)]
*  But there are some non-tough decisions that we can make, too. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=470.32s)]
*  Let's just take a look at the waste, the fraud and the abuse that we can uncover. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=473.98s)]
*  I am hard-pressed to think that the government runs so efficiently that we can't find any [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=478.02s)]
*  efficiencies in savings, in taking a look at auditing some of these programs that we [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=485.26s)]
*  have. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=491.9s)]
*  Some of these programs haven't been audited in decades, right? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=492.9s)]
*  The American people earn their money and they pay taxes. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=497.38s)]
*  Hard-working Americans. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=502.1s)]
*  I think it's high time and it's going to take some unconventional ideas and wisdom and [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=503.46000000000004s)]
*  thought process to get us out of this situation. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=509.74s)]
*  We have got to begin to examine where those hard-working American taxpaying dollars are [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=512.82s)]
*  going and what they're being spent on. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=519.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=522.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=523.82s)]
*  You know, when we were fighting to balance a budget, we understood we couldn't get the [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=524.82s)]
*  Senate to go along with us. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=530.5s)]
*  We couldn't get the White House to go along with us unless we use the power of the purse. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=532.0s)]
*  That's the one thing we had. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=537.32s)]
*  All spending bills, as you all know, start with you. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=538.6s)]
*  Start in the House of Representatives. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=541.88s)]
*  As an Article 1 champion, I'm concerned by what I'm seeing with Elon Musk going around [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=545.4s)]
*  and going from bureaucracy to bureaucracy. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=554.88s)]
*  He's seeming to do sort of line-item vetoes, saying, well, we don't want this, we don't [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=557.48s)]
*  want that. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=562.04s)]
*  I'm wondering, are you all concerned at all about this infringing upon your Article 1 [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=563.04s)]
*  powers because you all, as you know, you authorize it and then you appropriate it and then it [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=570.36s)]
*  moves forward for the president and the executive branch to spend it. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=577.32s)]
*  Are you concerned now or is there a moment, is there a red line Elon Musk could cross [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=581.7s)]
*  that would cause you real constitutional concerns? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=587.28s)]
*  Listen, I think what President Trump is doing by appointing Elon Musk is absolutely brilliant. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=590.92s)]
*  And I say that from this perspective. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=597.88s)]
*  We have a spending problem. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=601.18s)]
*  Thirty-six trillion dollars in debt. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=602.72s)]
*  We have a spending problem. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=605.3399999999999s)]
*  It is going to take some unconventional thought process, some unconventional wisdom to get [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=607.0s)]
*  us out of the mess that we're in right now. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=612.8399999999999s)]
*  So what Elon Musk is doing and what President Trump is allowing him to do, to audit the [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=616.74s)]
*  books, I think is brilliant. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=623.1800000000001s)]
*  And listen, look at what we're talking about right now. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=627.1s)]
*  We're talking for the first time in a long time about inappropriate or mismanaged funds. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=630.1s)]
*  We're actually talking about the issues. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=637.14s)]
*  That is the start. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=640.62s)]
*  You can't fix a problem until you first admit it's a problem. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=642.26s)]
*  And President Trump is doing an amazing job by actually telling us, hey, we have a problem [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=647.2s)]
*  and look at what we're uncovering. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=652.26s)]
*  So I'm happy we're having the discussion. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=654.66s)]
*  And I'm happy we're having the discussion too about waste, fraud and abuse, about using [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=658.34s)]
*  best practices. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=662.66s)]
*  Congressman though, this is usually though what subcommittees do. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=664.26s)]
*  This is what committees do in Congress. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=669.18s)]
*  This is what the Appropriations Committee does. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=671.66s)]
*  I mean, and that's constitutionally where it's supposed to be taken care of. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=674.2199999999999s)]
*  At some point, do you have concerns that they may go too far and may be stepping into your [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=679.54s)]
*  Article 1 powers? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=687.38s)]
*  Well, what's encouraging is that you balanced the budget, what you said, four separate times. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=689.1s)]
*  So there is hope for us here. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=693.3s)]
*  And I'll tell you, the process has been exceptionally member driven. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=694.66s)]
*  I serve on transportation, infrastructure, agriculture and small business. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=699.22s)]
*  And every single day we are meeting with inside of our various subcommittees, really putting [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=701.86s)]
*  in the work, getting to the bottom and looking at various different elements. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=705.9200000000001s)]
*  I mean, the reconciliation process is involving 11 different committees. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=709.22s)]
*  And I'm a new guy on the job here and the federal government is a very big place. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=713.62s)]
*  But we do have the power of the purse. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=717.74s)]
*  That's a big reason why I decided to run for Congress. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=719.5600000000001s)]
*  And I ran on having an economy that works and fiscal accountability. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=721.7s)]
*  So obviously we are working very hard on the reconciliation process as well as solidifying [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=725.26s)]
*  a five-year farm bill. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=729.98s)]
*  But it's certainly within our wheelhouse and we're going to continue to work for it. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=731.86s)]
*  All right, Republican Congressman Rob Bresnahan and Republican Conference Chair, Congresswoman [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=735.86s)]
*  Lisa McLean, thank you all both for being with us. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=741.72s)]
*  Hope we can continue the conversation. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=745.26s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=747.1s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=748.1s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=749.1s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt4v6BLCIgs&t=755.26s)]
