# 'Hardworking Americans pay tariffs': DNC Chair rebukes Treasury Secretary
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8)
*  Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, House lawmakers questioned Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=0.0s)]
*  about Trump's tariffs and who will foot the bill. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=5.64s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  Ask the answer to the questions I asked, please. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=10.52s)]
*  I only have five minutes. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=12.76s)]
*  Who pays tariffs? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=13.76s)]
*  Sorry? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=14.76s)]
*  Who pays tariffs? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=15.76s)]
*  Sorry? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=16.76s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, please. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=17.76s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=18.76s)]
*  The question is very simply, who pays tariffs, Mr. Chairman? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=19.76s)]
*  I'd like him to answer that question. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=21.04s)]
*  He wants to answer other questions. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=22.96s)]
*  Congressman, if the exporters dislike tariffs so much, why wouldn't they, if I think what [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=25.2s)]
*  you're trying to get me to say... [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=38.72s)]
*  Did you remember the question? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=39.72s)]
*  I'm not sure you did. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=40.72s)]
*  Who pays tariffs? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=41.72s)]
*  It's a very complicated question. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=42.72s)]
*  Reclaiming my time. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=45.96s)]
*  People pay tariffs. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=47.28s)]
*  So I'll ask one more time, who pays tariffs? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=48.84s)]
*  Sir, the history would show that it is a complicated mix of who pays the tariffs over various times. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=53.16s)]
*  So that's exactly the problem. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  If your answer, and you are a very educated person, you have a very impressive bio, cannot [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=61.599999999999994s)]
*  answer the question, who pays tariffs, because you won't answer that, and you say it's a [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=65.6s)]
*  complicated issue. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=69.19999999999999s)]
*  It's not complicated. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=70.4s)]
*  Consumers pay Trump's tariff tax. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=72.08s)]
*  That's the reality. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=75.19999999999999s)]
*  That is... [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=77.84s)]
*  That's depressing. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=80.64s)]
*  I mean, Scott Besson... [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=81.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=83.8s)]
*  Let's bring in the chair of the Democratic National Committee, Ken Martin, president [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=84.8s)]
*  of the National Action Network and host of MSNBC's Politics Nation, Reverend Al Sharpton, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=89.64s)]
*  joins the conversation as well. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=95.32s)]
*  It's good to have you both. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=98.56s)]
*  Does anyone want to try and answer the question? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  Who pays tariffs? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=102.84s)]
*  Ken Martin. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=104.52s)]
*  Reval. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=105.52s)]
*  Well, look, we know who pays tariffs, and it's hardworking Americans who put their faith [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=106.52s)]
*  in Donald Trump last year, hoping that he was going to actually make their lives more [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=111.56s)]
*  affordable. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=115.84s)]
*  He's done just the opposite. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=116.84s)]
*  These tariffs are going to result in a huge tax on hardworking American people. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  And you know, the fact that Secretary Besson couldn't answer that question honestly just [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=122.28s)]
*  shows you what they're doing to try to deceive the American people. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=127.04s)]
*  These tariffs are going to make it harder for hardworking Americans to actually afford [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=130.16s)]
*  their lives. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=133.96s)]
*  Ken Martin, not Jay Martin. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=135.68s)]
*  So that's the answer. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=136.88s)]
*  And why do you think the Treasury secretary was having such a hard time answering that [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=139.16s)]
*  question at a hearing where it was so simple? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=144.24s)]
*  What's going on there? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=148.36s)]
*  Do they not want the American people to know that it's going to cost them a lot of money? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=149.36s)]
*  Well, I think it's as clear as day what's happening in this country, both with him trying [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=153.48000000000002s)]
*  to evade answering a very simple question, right? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=157.44s)]
*  This is not complicated at all. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=160.28s)]
*  You put a tax on goods, the people who buy those goods are going to pay more. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=162.04000000000002s)]
*  It's very simple. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=166.44s)]
*  But this has been happening over the last 100 days with Donald Trump and the Republicans [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=167.56s)]
*  trying to basically put a lid on the lives, people knowing what's happening to lives around [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=172.56s)]
*  this country. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=180.24s)]
*  Think about this. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=181.24s)]
*  The one reason we did the town halls, we've done over 108 town halls now in 45 states [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=182.24s)]
*  is because Speaker Johnson canceled the town halls because they don't want Americans to [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=186.28s)]
*  know what's actually happening out there right now. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=191.0s)]
*  So this is just another pattern from this administration of trying to deceive the American [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=193.84s)]
*  people. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=198.12s)]
*  It's no surprise why, because they made promises that they're now not delivering on. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=199.12s)]
*  So Chairman Martin, the talk about tariffs, which of course very well could be raising [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=203.0s)]
*  prices for many Americans no matter where you live, comes at the same time as Republicans [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=208.3s)]
*  are putting together their budget bill, which is going to have potentially drastic cuts [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=212.24s)]
*  to a number of services in order to pay for tax cuts that will largely benefit the rich. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=216.5s)]
*  This feels like a kind of a golden political opportunity for Democrats here. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=222.8s)]
*  How do you take advantage? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=227.68s)]
*  Well, look, I mean, it's not a great position to be in. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=228.68s)]
*  I mean, let's be honest about this. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=232.88000000000002s)]
*  The impacts that this will have on hundreds of thousands and millions of Americans is [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=234.36s)]
*  going to be devastating. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=238.92000000000002s)]
*  And I know firsthand, you know, my mom had me when she was 15 years old. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=240.34s)]
*  She raised four kids by the time she was 20. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=243.64000000000001s)]
*  We struggled mightily with poverty in and out of shelters. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=246.22000000000003s)]
*  And if it wasn't for Medicaid and if it wasn't for SNAP, I went to add health care or food [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=249.48s)]
*  when I was a child. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=253.95999999999998s)]
*  And that is the real-life consequence of what we're seeing right now with these cuts. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=254.95999999999998s)]
*  It only takes three brave Republicans with a spine to stand up right now and do the right [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=259.2s)]
*  thing, which is to actually put forward a budget that's going to work for working people [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=264.24s)]
*  in this country instead of the billionaires. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=268.96s)]
*  And that's all they seem to care about right now. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=270.88s)]
*  So sure, yes, we'll take this fight on. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=273.08s)]
*  We'll take this fight on every single day because we're going to stand up for hard work [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=275.68s)]
*  in Americans unlike the Republican Party. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=279.08000000000004s)]
*  So you just mentioned part of your personal story, your mother becoming pregnant at 15, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=281.08000000000004s)]
*  having you at 15, raised in shelters in and out, poverty, you know, hanging over your [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=285.40000000000003s)]
*  head each and every day. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=290.52000000000004s)]
*  Why is it that so many Democrats seem unable to articulate and address problems that ordinary [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=292.0s)]
*  people, ordinary people would say, oh, yeah, that's like me? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=299.40000000000003s)]
*  What is wrong with the Democratic Party's vocabulary? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=304.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, listen, you know, I say this serenity prayer every morning. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=307.92s)]
*  I can only control what I can control. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=311.24s)]
*  And I can tell you what I'm doing is making sure that I not only tell my story, but we [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=313.44000000000005s)]
*  tell the story of so many Americans right now, which is why those town halls are so [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=317.20000000000005s)]
*  important, is to actually make sure that we're not just talking about this through a policy [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=321.96000000000004s)]
*  lens, but we're hearing from real people who are having real-life impacts from these cuts [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=326.32000000000005s)]
*  to this government, from this budget that they're trying to put forward. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=331.40000000000003s)]
*  So it is important to your point. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=334.48s)]
*  Let's get out of our ivory towers and realize that behind every single number on a [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=336.12s)]
*  spreadsheet is an American person's life, who at the end of the day is going to be [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=340.20000000000005s)]
*  devastated by this budget. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=344.6s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, great to have you back on the show this morning. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=347.16s)]
*  We've been talking in the last week or so about this poll from ABC News and Washington [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=349.64000000000004s)]
*  Post that ask Americans who's better to solve their problems. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=353.52000000000004s)]
*  Donald Trump's rating is terrible at 37 percent, but Democrats are seven points worse at [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=357.64000000000004s)]
*  30 percent, with 30 percent of respondents saying neither are better at handling the [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=363.92s)]
*  country's main problems. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=368.36s)]
*  So we've asked some members, some Democratic members, how they turn that number around, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=369.71999999999997s)]
*  how they explain that number. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=374.64s)]
*  I'm curious what you think about why the Democrats are at 30 percent and below Donald [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=376.0s)]
*  Trump and what you do to change it. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=380.84s)]
*  Well, we've lost trust with voters and we've talked about this on the show before. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=382.36s)]
*  We actually have to show folks that we're going to stand up, right, grow a spine and [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=386.15999999999997s)]
*  fight for their lives. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=390.48s)]
*  I think the reality is part of it is actually making sure that we're communicating our [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=391.56s)]
*  values the right way, connecting our policies that we support back to people's lives. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=396.16s)]
*  The other part of it is actually delivering when we have power. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=400.6s)]
*  Part of the challenge is in the past, we've elected Democrats to office and we haven't [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=403.68s)]
*  delivered on the promises that we've made to the American people about actually improving [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=407.64s)]
*  people's lives and strengthening communities. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=411.56s)]
*  So, look, we have to fight like hell right now. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=414.0s)]
*  We have to resist Donald Trump with every fiber of our being. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=416.52s)]
*  We have to. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=419.76s)]
*  We also have to give the American people a sense of the credible alternative. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=420.52s)]
*  What is it that we would do to actually improve their lives? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=424.56s)]
*  How will we make their communities better? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=427.36s)]
*  And when we do that, I think we can win again. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=429.12s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=431.36s)]
*  It starts with being bold. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=431.96s)]
*  It starts with being authentic. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=433.28s)]
*  It starts with standing up and fighting for your values. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=434.72s)]
*  Right. My old boss in politics, Paul Wellstone, he said you should never separate the life [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=437.6s)]
*  you lead from the words you speak. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=442.15999999999997s)]
*  People want authentic, strong leaders who are going to fight for what they believe in. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=443.8s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, first of all, it's refreshing to have a DNC chair say he says that he prays [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=448.03999999999996s)]
*  every morning. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=453.91999999999996s)]
*  But aside from that, wouldn't you say that the Democratic Party in the last at least [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=454.76s)]
*  couple of cycles failed to show that what was being promised by Trump was inadvertently [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=462.44s)]
*  hurting the working class that he claimed to be speaking for, like we began this conversation [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=469.15999999999997s)]
*  with terrorists? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=474.44s)]
*  How do we get the language and messaging straight that you use in many ways what he's proposing [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=475.28000000000003s)]
*  against him? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=483.12s)]
*  Say, yes, this is going to cost you. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=484.16s)]
*  Whereas it's not just punishing China or whoever is punishing you. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=487.16s)]
*  Hasn't the Democrats in many ways fumbled getting that message across the goal line? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=491.72s)]
*  Well, look, again, I mean, I think that's certainly been a challenge in recent years. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=497.28000000000003s)]
*  But I think what we've seen right now is a unified voice. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=501.92s)]
*  You see Democrats across the board from our Democratic attorney generals fighting this [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=504.88s)]
*  fight in the courts, our mayors and governors creating safe spaces for communities that [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=509.32s)]
*  are being impacted by this and our members of Congress. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=514.3199999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=516.92s)]
*  You saw this with Senator Booker's amazing speech on the floor. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=517.64s)]
*  You've seen this with congressional members using the power of their voice and their [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=520.9599999999999s)]
*  platforms to move public sentiment on this issue. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=524.72s)]
*  I'll tell you what. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=527.4399999999999s)]
*  Our party is unified. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=528.4399999999999s)]
*  Our party is fighting back and our party is doing their job right now to make sure that [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=530.16s)]
*  we cut through all this noise and we give Americans a sense that their better days are [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=534.6s)]
*  ahead of them, and especially with Democrats in control. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=539.0400000000001s)]
*  Aren't we in the golden age? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=542.76s)]
*  I'm confused. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=544.28s)]
*  Chair of the Democratic National Committee, Ken Martin, thank you very much for coming [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=545.6s)]
*  on the show this morning. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=550.84s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=551.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r87CSHTGpi8&t=552.64s)]
