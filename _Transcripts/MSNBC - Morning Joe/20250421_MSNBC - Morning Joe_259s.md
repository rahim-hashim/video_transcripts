# 'He prayed for peace in Ukraine': Zelenskyy honors Pope Francis
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [April 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM)
*  Well, moments ago, as we mentioned Ukraine here, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=0.0s)]
*  just posted this. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=4.96s)]
*  Millions of people around the world are mourning the tragic news of Pope Francis' passing. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=8.06s)]
*  His life was devoted to God, to people, and to the Church. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  He knew how to give hope, ease suffering through prayer, and foster unity. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=20.38s)]
*  He prayed for peace in Ukraine and for Ukrainians. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=26.12s)]
*  We grieve together with Catholics and all Christians who look to the Pope Francis for [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=30.520000000000003s)]
*  spiritual support, eternal memory. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  Let's bring in NBC News Chief International Correspondent Keir Simmons live from Dubai. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=39.84s)]
*  Keir, tell us more about reaction from around the world. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=45.6s)]
*  Well, the reaction is unanimous. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=51.4s)]
*  And you read then the statement from President Zelensky of Ukraine, Mika. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=54.0s)]
*  This was a pope of, as you've been saying, of mercy and compassion, but also of enormous [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=60.56s)]
*  sacrifice. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=66.32s)]
*  That message of peace for Ukraine and Gaza, that message he sent just yesterday, so hours [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=67.32s)]
*  before his passing. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=74.58s)]
*  And I was thinking, Mika, about being there at the Vatican in 2013 when he was chosen [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=77.12s)]
*  for the Papacy and how we marveled at the way that he immediately rejected the kind [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=83.32000000000001s)]
*  of trinkets and baubles and instead made it clear through his actions that he was a man [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=92.16000000000001s)]
*  of the people. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=98.88000000000001s)]
*  And incredible, isn't it, that even right until the final hours he was doing the same [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=100.36000000000001s)]
*  thing? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=105.24000000000001s)]
*  Once again, appearing in St. Peter's Square and again, sending that message to Ukraine [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=106.36s)]
*  and to Gaza, even while he could not know, we did not know that that was his final day [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=113.28s)]
*  of work. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=120.75999999999999s)]
*  His final hours were spent giving to people and trying to send the message that he has [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=121.75999999999999s)]
*  been trying to send through his entire papacy. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=127.52s)]
*  And it hasn't been easy. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=130.4s)]
*  The controversy has been there. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=132.04s)]
*  And not simply in the ways you might suspect. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=135.16s)]
*  So controversy from Ukraine, for example, when he had a Russian woman and a Ukrainian [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=138.12s)]
*  woman carry the cross together early on, close to the time of Russia's full-scale invasion [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  of Ukraine. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=149.96s)]
*  That caused a good deal of backlash in Ukraine because inevitably the emotions are so high. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=151.12s)]
*  But what the Pope did then and did and has continued to do was to try to hold out that [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=157.23999999999998s)]
*  message of compassion for everyone, for all, no matter what side you're on. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=165.51999999999998s)]
*  And that really is the role of a Pope, a modern Pope, you would think. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=170.56s)]
*  As you mentioned, the question now, who will take his place? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=176.56s)]
*  We haven't had, the conclave hasn't been announced even yet. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=181.28s)]
*  We have to have the plans for the funeral, all of those things. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=186.04s)]
*  And there will be some back and forth, some pressure within the politics of the Catholic [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=188.16s)]
*  Church over what kind of Pope should come next, as Joe was mentioning, and whether it [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=192.44s)]
*  should be someone to follow the traditions of Pope Francis or to take the Church in a [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=197.36s)]
*  different direction. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=201.36s)]
*  But there will be many, many who will be hoping that his legacy is not just a legacy but continues. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=202.56s)]
*  And many from different places, the King of England, King Charles, for example, meeting [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=211.95999999999998s)]
*  with the Pope just in recent weeks, again, very close to his passing. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=218.28s)]
*  You mentioned the Vice President, JD Rance, meeting with the Pope just in recent days. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=222.79999999999998s)]
*  Again, what an example by a man who gave his life to the Church and the last more than [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=227.39999999999998s)]
*  a decade of his life to the papacy. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mERobayuLnM&t=236.64s)]
