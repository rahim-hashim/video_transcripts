# Trump is flouting the law: Lawmaker who met with Abrego Garcia rebukes WH for violating court order
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [April 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs)
*  And joining us now, Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=0.0s)]
*  He recently returned from a trip to El Salvador, where he met with Kilmar Abrego Garcia. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=4.38s)]
*  He's also a member of the Foreign Relations Committee. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=10.64s)]
*  And Senator Pope Francis' last words, final public remarks, focused on this theme. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=14.16s)]
*  How much contempt is stirred up at times toward the vulnerable, the marginalized, and migrants, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=22.38s)]
*  Francis wrote in a papal address delivered on Easter Sunday yesterday by a Vatican aide [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=29.12s)]
*  to the crowds gathered in St. Peter's Square. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=34.68s)]
*  And here we are, you on, I guess, just back now from El Salvador, dealing with the issue [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=38.620000000000005s)]
*  of just one of the many people who have been forcibly removed, disappeared. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=46.16s)]
*  I mean, some might even see it as a kidnapping. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=53.52s)]
*  It's definitely not a deportation. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=56.540000000000006s)]
*  Where does the plight of Kilmar Abrego Garcia stand now? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=58.92s)]
*  Well, you're very right. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  I read Pope Francis' remarks. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=66.16s)]
*  He was a beautiful soul, a pope for all of humanity, and he focused on the most vulnerable [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=69.48s)]
*  and on natural rights, on the right of everybody to be free under the law. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=76.08s)]
*  And the whole point here that we're making is that the Trump administration needs to [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=84.44s)]
*  respect the Constitution of the United States. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=90.0s)]
*  When you threaten the rights of one man like Abrego Garcia, take away the rights of one [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=93.08s)]
*  man like Abrego Garcia, you threaten the rights for everybody. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=98.67999999999999s)]
*  In this case, the Trump administration is flouting the law because the Supreme Court [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=102.44s)]
*  nine to zero ruling said that they had to facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=108.48s)]
*  I was just down there, as you said, I met with them. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=114.2s)]
*  The embassy, the Trump administration is doing nothing right now to comply with that court [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=118.08s)]
*  order. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=124.76s)]
*  What they're doing is trying to change the subject as if you can't comply with the Constitution [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=125.76s)]
*  and fight gang violence. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=131.94s)]
*  I've been fighting MS-13 longer than Donald Trump probably ever uttered the words. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=133.48s)]
*  I put together an anti-gang task force in this Washington region, Maryland, Washington, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=138.84s)]
*  Virginia. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=144.23999999999998s)]
*  So the notion that fighting gangs requires that you shred the Constitution and deny people's [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=145.23999999999998s)]
*  rights is just the dangerous spin that Donald Trump is putting on all this. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=151.39999999999998s)]
*  Senator, good morning. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=156.92s)]
*  Two part question for you. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=158.76s)]
*  First, just tell us a little bit about your visit. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  I know there was the El Salvador government. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=162.16s)]
*  You alleged that they sort of tried to stagecraft some of this, putting drinks on the table [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=164.16s)]
*  and the like to try to suggest that the inmate there was being well taken care of. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=168.52s)]
*  Tell us about how he is doing, but also could you respond to some Democrats who say actually [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=176.28s)]
*  too much attention is being paid to this one case, but why you think it matters and why [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=180.04s)]
*  you made this trip? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=185.9s)]
*  Well, I think it matters because it's never wrong to protect the, you know, fight for [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=189.0s)]
*  the Constitution of the United States and that's what we're doing here. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=193.72s)]
*  We're fighting for the rule of law and if you take it away, as I said, for one person, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=198.28s)]
*  you threaten it for all. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=203.72s)]
*  So I met with Abrego Garcia. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=205.56s)]
*  He's been in a total news blackout. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=208.12s)]
*  He hasn't been able to communicate with anybody, not his wife, not his lawyer. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=210.0s)]
*  That is a violation of international law. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=214.68s)]
*  I told him that, you know, people here were fighting for his constitutional rights. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=217.72s)]
*  I passed along the love from his wife and his family. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=224.44s)]
*  He obviously has been traumatized. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=230.04s)]
*  He said so and he said, I don't understand why I was abducted off the streets of Maryland [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=232.32s)]
*  and end up in prison in El Salvador, which is why we need to fight for his rights. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=238.68s)]
*  All right, we have Julia Ainsley who's been covering all angles of this story for us. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=245.23999999999998s)]
*  Julia has a question for the senator. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=249.92s)]
*  Julia? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=251.79999999999998s)]
*  Senator, you are in a unique position in that you've actually spoken to someone who's been [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=252.79999999999998s)]
*  on the inside, one of the recent deportees. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=257.0s)]
*  What did Mr. Abrego Garcia tell you about the conditions inside? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=260.44s)]
*  What is it like to sleep? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=264.4s)]
*  How often are they let out of their cell? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=265.6s)]
*  And have these men been given any kind of information about how long they will be incarcerated [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=267.74s)]
*  there? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=273.52s)]
*  So starting with your last question, one of the things about CICOT, which is this notorious [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=274.52s)]
*  prison in El Salvador, is that the prisoners there have no communication with the outside [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=281.68s)]
*  world. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=287.91999999999996s)]
*  None. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=288.91999999999996s)]
*  Not with their lawyers, not with their families, which in itself is a violation of international [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=289.91999999999996s)]
*  law. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=294.12s)]
*  He told me that he, when he was first moved to CICOT, he was in a cell with about 25 other [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=295.35999999999996s)]
*  prisoners, that he wasn't scared about the other prisoners in his cell, but he was traumatized [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=301.84s)]
*  by the prisoners in other cells who taunted him. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=308.44s)]
*  And these other cells were just packed with prisoners. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=312.67999999999995s)]
*  He has been moved subsequently to a place with better conditions, but again, is in a [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=316.52s)]
*  total news blackout and unable to communicate with anybody. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=324.47999999999996s)]
*  I was the first person he's communicated with, and to my knowledge, the last from the outside [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=328.28s)]
*  world. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=333.08s)]
*  I'm working now to try to make sure that his wife can talk to him. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=334.08s)]
*  That was his one request, other than seeking his freedom, was to be able to talk to his [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=338.79999999999995s)]
*  wife. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=343.23999999999995s)]
*  Senator, I don't know if I could ask you one more question. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=344.23999999999995s)]
*  I know you're on a tight timeline, but I want to ask you about why you are so focused on [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=346.91999999999996s)]
*  the case of this man, why you traveled to El Salvador, and back to the issue of what [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=355.04s)]
*  has happened to all of these people who have been sent to this prison, because the normal [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=359.0s)]
*  process of deportation, the DHS issues, a notice to appear, there's a formal hearing [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=363.76000000000005s)]
*  in immigration court. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=372.88s)]
*  The process involves that hearing where the government must prove the person is deportable. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=374.64000000000004s)]
*  Because that did not happen in this case and in many others. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=380.8s)]
*  What happened to these people? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=384.66s)]
*  How would you describe it? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=385.74s)]
*  What's the term you would use? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=387.12s)]
*  I would say they were illegally abducted by U.S. government agents and then taken to foreign [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=390.96000000000004s)]
*  prisons against the law. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=398.40000000000003s)]
*  The reason why it's important to treat each of these cases individually under the law [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=401.0s)]
*  is because our Constitution requires due process before people can be deprived of their [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=406.9s)]
*  liberty. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=412.82s)]
*  In the case of Abrego Garcia, for example, the federal district court judge said that [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=414.7s)]
*  the Trump administration had provided absolutely no evidence linking him to MS-13, which is [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=419.14s)]
*  why I've said they need to put up or shut up in court and not just sort of wage this [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=426.46s)]
*  campaign on social media. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=432.52s)]
*  The whole reason we have a Constitution and due process is to protect the rights of the [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=435.46s)]
*  individual. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=441.65999999999997s)]
*  And I think more and more, certainly libertarians and other conservatives who are actually looking [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=442.65999999999997s)]
*  at the facts of this case are very worried about the idea that the government of the [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=448.52s)]
*  United States can deprive someone of their liberty, abduct them, send them to El Salvador [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=453.9s)]
*  where they're going, lock them in a prison, to do all that without any due process. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=461.18s)]
*  That is a scary proposition. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=466.74s)]
*  And if you don't fight for the constitutional rights of one person, as I say, others can [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=468.64s)]
*  be next. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=473.98s)]
*  Abductions by the U.S. government in America. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=476.98s)]
*  Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, thank you very much for coming on the show [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=481.34000000000003s)]
*  this morning. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=485.46000000000004s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=486.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpG0Ejz5vcs&t=488.36s)]
