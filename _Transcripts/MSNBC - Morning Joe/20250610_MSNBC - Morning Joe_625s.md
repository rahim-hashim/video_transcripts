# 'An immoral document': Senator slams Trump's megabill
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g)
*  Joining us now, Democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=0.0s)]
*  He is a member of the Foreign Relations Judiciary and Appropriations Committee. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=3.12s)]
*  Senator, always good to see you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=7.04s)]
*  We have a lot of ground to cover with you this morning, but let's just first start with [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=8.36s)]
*  a beat on what you're seeing in Southern California there. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=11.28s)]
*  What is your view as to the appropriateness of the President of the United States, not [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=15.08s)]
*  just deploying the National Guard over the objections of that state's governor, but also [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=19.88s)]
*  now sending Marines to the streets of an American city? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=24.28s)]
*  Well, Jonathan, this is a striking moment, and it is urgent and important for folks to [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=29.2s)]
*  speak up and push back on the president politicizing our military. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=33.879999999999995s)]
*  The right to peaceful protest is right there in the Constitution, and as long as these [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=38.96s)]
*  protests are peaceful and local and state law enforcement have them well in hand, as [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=43.76s)]
*  the chief of police of the LAPD has said, I see no good reason for the National Guard [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  to be called out or active duty combat trained Marines. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=56.8s)]
*  Law enforcement is trained to handle these protests, not active duty military. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=61.16s)]
*  And frankly, it is simply upping the ante and creating a spectacle that is the real [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=66.52s)]
*  goal here of President Trump. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=72.16s)]
*  I'll remind you, our reality TV show president is a master of distraction. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=74.08s)]
*  And last week, all we were talking about here in the Capitol was Elon Musk attacking his [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=79.28s)]
*  big, beautiful bill as a budget and deficit buster and a few anxious Republican senators [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=84.72s)]
*  saying that the bill that is come over from the House to the Senate that will rip away [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=91.72s)]
*  health care from 16 million Americans is a bad idea. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=96.88s)]
*  Today, all we're talking about is the protests in L.A., and that's on purpose. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  It's a distraction. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=107.24000000000001s)]
*  Well, let's not ignore the bill. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=109.24000000000001s)]
*  That's actually where I was going to go next and ask you, Senator, where does it stand [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=112.16s)]
*  and exactly what do you see in the bill that is perhaps detrimental to the American people, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=116.72s)]
*  especially those who voted for President Donald Trump? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=123.76s)]
*  Well, later today, make hundreds and hundreds of faith leaders, clergy, rabbis, priests, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=128.96s)]
*  ministers are going to gather on the steps of the U.S. Capitol for a peaceful vigil reminding [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=134.72s)]
*  senators in our nation that no faith teaches that you should take away food from hungry [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=141.0s)]
*  children and health care from seniors and children in order to pay for a bigger tax [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=147.08s)]
*  cut for billionaires and the biggest corporations. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=153.48s)]
*  That is the core of what this bill does. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=156.98s)]
*  It extends tax cuts for the very wealthiest Americans. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=159.8s)]
*  And in order to try and pretend that they are paying for it, it is changing the rules [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=163.48s)]
*  of Medicaid to impose new paperwork requirements that will disqualify or throw off millions, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=167.92s)]
*  either by ending the tax breaks that make the Affordable Care Act affordable to the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  middle class or by imposing new requirements that working folks won't be able to meet and [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=180.11999999999998s)]
*  they'll thus lose health care. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=186.27999999999997s)]
*  This protest, this peaceful vigil is just a reminder that for all of us who count ourselves [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=188.23999999999998s)]
*  as people of faith or for Americans who are concerned about the qualities of our nation, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=194.32s)]
*  this is a critical moment. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=201.07999999999998s)]
*  Dictators around the world are cheered by the visual of our president deploying troops [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  to try and suppress domestic protests. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=208.92s)]
*  Here in the Senate, we need to focus on what we're teaching our children and the world [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=212.0s)]
*  about our values. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=216.51999999999998s)]
*  A budget is a moral document and this budget bill is an immoral document. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=218.12s)]
*  We'll be following that. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=225.12s)]
*  And I know as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I'd love to get your [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=226.4s)]
*  take on this next story along with General Barry McCaffrey. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  Russia attacked multiple cities in Ukraine overnight, less than 24 hours after what Ukrainian [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=235.28s)]
*  officials described as the largest drone assault of the war so far. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=241.56s)]
*  NBC News Chief Foreign Correspondent Richard Engel has the details. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=246.28s)]
*  Russia is attacking Ukraine on a level not seen before. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=252.72s)]
*  This morning, Russia's main targets were Ukraine's cities, civilians in Kiev, sending families [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=257.0s)]
*  down into the subway stations. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=263.12s)]
*  Russia firing on residential buildings and a maternity hospital in Odessa. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=266.47999999999996s)]
*  President Zelensky said Russia fired 315 drones and seven missiles overnight after yesterday [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=272.03999999999996s)]
*  launching nearly 500 drones and 20 missiles, the highest number of attacks since the war [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=278.24s)]
*  began. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=284.24s)]
*  But Ukraine says it shot down nearly all of them. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=286.56s)]
*  As the U.S. continues to publicly push for peace, the attacks appear to be part of Russian [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=290.32s)]
*  President Vladimir Putin's response to Ukraine's surprise drone attack earlier this month deep [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=295.52s)]
*  inside Russia that, according to an NBC News analysis, destroyed at least 10 Russian strategic [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=301.6s)]
*  bombers. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=307.88s)]
*  Ukrainians seem to be feeling a bit more confident these days. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=309.36s)]
*  Yes, there have been many Russian attacks. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=311.88s)]
*  But the fact that the Ukrainians have been able to stop almost all of them while also [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=314.44s)]
*  inflicting heavy damage on the Russian side is lifting spirits here. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=319.48s)]
*  In the southern city of Mikulayev, you could hardly tell there's a war going on. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=324.44s)]
*  This is not the impression that most people have of Ukraine. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=330.0s)]
*  Everyone out, kids out, playing. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=334.56s)]
*  There were Russian attacks just a few hours ago. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=337.24s)]
*  Yet people are still out and about. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=340.28s)]
*  I can't wrap my head around it either, says Olga Dubrovna, an oncologist and mother of [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=345.4s)]
*  two. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=350.24s)]
*  Can you imagine people get used to this? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=351.24s)]
*  People are dying, kids are dying, and tomorrow the sun is shining and we keep living, she [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=353.44s)]
*  says. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=358.52s)]
*  Despite the tensions, Russia and Ukraine still manage to exchange prisoners of war on Monday. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=359.52s)]
*  10 POWs returning to their families, all soldiers under 25 captured by Russia. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=365.8s)]
*  According to a Russian official, Ukraine freed an equal number of Russian troops. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=372.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=376.92s)]
*  I want to start with Barry McCraffy, General. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=377.92s)]
*  Just curious in terms of your response to the latest developments out of Ukraine, this [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=381.72s)]
*  horrific set of developments. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=387.32s)]
*  But also, in lieu of serious U.S. engagement, what does Ukraine need and where can they [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=389.2s)]
*  get it? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=396.96s)]
*  Well, look, our Secretary of Defense was just attended a NATO meeting. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=397.96s)]
*  There's almost no press coverage at his choice. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=404.48s)]
*  He then skipped the meeting of the allies and partners supporting Ukraine, more than [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=407.52s)]
*  50 nations, and came home quietly. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=411.88s)]
*  We've got one of the most desperate wars going on in Europe since World War II. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=415.32s)]
*  It looks like World War I battle of Verdun with UAVs and remotely piloted vehicles on [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=420.84000000000003s)]
*  top of it, high-tech jamming. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=427.8s)]
*  The Russians are in a desperate situation, I think, a million casualties. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=430.44s)]
*  Their economy battered by this ongoing war, which has largely been unsuccessful to them. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=436.88s)]
*  So I think the problem is that our NATO allies see us as withdrawing from the defense of [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=444.12s)]
*  Europe. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=450.2s)]
*  We still have 100,000 troops there, but they no longer can trust us to stand with Ukraine [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=452.04s)]
*  or to stand with NATO. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=457.88s)]
*  Europeans are under tremendous pressure. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=460.4s)]
*  They're starting to rearm. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=462.24s)]
*  It's a perilous moment without U.S. leadership. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=464.08s)]
*  So Senator, let's get you in on this Ukraine situation and the current status here. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=468.04s)]
*  It does not escape attention that every time President Trump sends public signals like [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=473.3s)]
*  he might step away from the conflict, away from peace talks, Russia seems to step into [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=477.34s)]
*  that void and only escalate the bombardment of Ukraine. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=482.53999999999996s)]
*  Let's be clear. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=488.3s)]
*  Putin is a gangster and a thug who continues to use his advanced military to strike hospitals, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=489.3s)]
*  schools, daycares, civilians. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=496.5s)]
*  When Ukraine punches back, they strike bombers and Air Force bases. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=499.74s)]
*  There is no equivalence between the Ukrainians who are fighting bravely to recover their [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=504.82s)]
*  sovereignty and their freedom and Russia, which under Putin is the aggressor. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=510.22s)]
*  A bipartisan group of senators met last week with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=515.22s)]
*  shared with us both alarming intelligence, now publicly shared by the head of German [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=520.5600000000001s)]
*  intelligence that Russia is rapidly rearming well beyond what they need to conquer Ukraine. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=526.14s)]
*  It is their intention to test all of NATO. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=532.62s)]
*  The good news here, Jonathan, is that our NATO partners and allies like Germany are [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=535.66s)]
*  dramatically increasing their defense spending. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=540.42s)]
*  The Ukrainians continue to fight with ingenuity and determination. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=543.5s)]
*  Putin is trying to break our spirit and our alliance. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=548.58s)]
*  And President Trump will go down in history as an enormous strategic loser on America's [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=552.62s)]
*  behalf if he allows that to happen. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5sNKjVup2g&t=558.46s)]
