# Trump says Elon Musk will face 'very serious consequences' if he funds Democratic candidates
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE)
*  And President Trump says he assumes his relationship with Elon Musk is now over after their online [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=0.0s)]
*  feud exploded last week. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=5.44s)]
*  When asked by NBC's Christian Welker if he has any desire to repair ties with Musk, Trump [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=7.82s)]
*  said, no, adding he has no intention of speaking to the Tesla CEO. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=12.22s)]
*  But Trump also issued a warning to Musk, saying he will face very serious consequences if [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=16.92s)]
*  he funds Democratic candidates to run against Republicans that vote in favor of the budget [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=21.5s)]
*  bill. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=25.92s)]
*  Trump didn't share what those consequences would be. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=26.92s)]
*  The president also cast doubt on the notion that Musk's opposition would even sink the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=29.62s)]
*  bill, claiming he's more confident than ever it will pass because Republicans are more [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=33.26s)]
*  unified in the wake of that public feud. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=37.22s)]
*  Joining us now, national politics reporter for The Hill, Julia Manchester. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=39.980000000000004s)]
*  Julia, is that true? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=43.5s)]
*  Do you get the sense that Republicans are more unified now than ever? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=44.74s)]
*  I couldn't help but notice that Senator Ron Johnson, who has been outspoken about his [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=48.02s)]
*  concerns about this bill, was ever so slightly more muted over the weekend. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=52.74s)]
*  Is that a sign of what the president's talking about here? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=57.16s)]
*  Well, look, Ali, I think you have a lot of these fiscal conservatives who had problems [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=59.36s)]
*  in the first place with the size of this bill, like Ron Johnson, for example, maybe holding [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=64.36s)]
*  back in their criticism a bit. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=71.52s)]
*  However, in general, if you take a broader look at Republicans as a whole, I think they [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=73.64s)]
*  are very much unified behind President Trump. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=78.47999999999999s)]
*  I think President Trump at this point is obviously the face and the leader of the Republican [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=81.84s)]
*  Party. Even though Elon Musk has holds quite a bit of influence, I still think President [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=86.4s)]
*  Trump holds some sway there. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=91.32s)]
*  The only issue, though, is, like I said, with those very fiscally conservative Republicans [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=93.96s)]
*  who might see some agreement with Elon Musk on this. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=99.4s)]
*  And I think with Elon Musk going forward, if we look at him as a potential, I don't [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=102.8s)]
*  want to say challenger to President Trump, but someone who's going to be a voice of [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=107.24s)]
*  opposition. He is someone who has, you know, what, over 22 million, you know, Twitter [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=110.52000000000001s)]
*  followers, someone who has that very broad, wide platform. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=116.12s)]
*  So, you know, he is someone who could certainly push back on Trump. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=121.88000000000001s)]
*  But right now, I think Republicans are relatively unified behind the president. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=125.60000000000001s)]
*  I don't really call it X either, Julia, for what it's worth. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=129.8s)]
*  It's hard to get out of that old habit. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=132.76s)]
*  Yeah, it definitely happens. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=134.48000000000002s)]
*  But look, they are also men who culturally are still aligned. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=135.96s)]
*  I mean, you look at Elon Musk's feed right now and he's echoing a lot of the same [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=139.64s)]
*  sentiments that Trump and others within the administration are echoing around [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=143.83999999999997s)]
*  immigration and what we're seeing on the ground in Los Angeles. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=147.72s)]
*  So there is still a mutuality between these two guys. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=150.6s)]
*  I think the open question is, and this is a question for Republicans and Democrats, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=153.88s)]
*  frankly, what role politically could Musk play? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=158.07999999999998s)]
*  You see Trump saying he'll face consequences if he funds Democrats. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=161.32s)]
*  But the other litmus test on the Democratic side of the aisle has been, will you would [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=164.76s)]
*  you even take that money from him? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=168.6s)]
*  People like Senator Cory Booker and others saying, no, I wouldn't take it. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=170.28s)]
*  But that's kind of where Democrats are being faced right now. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=173.32s)]
*  Right. Like how do they maneuver around the musk of it all? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=176.04s)]
*  Well, it's interesting because you have Congressman Ro Khanna from California, who is [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  seen as this more progressive figure, but, you know, obviously has those ties to [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=183.4s)]
*  Silicon Valley. It's a part of his congressional district. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=187.68s)]
*  He's saying, look, Democrats should open up a dialogue with Elon Musk. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=190.44s)]
*  But, you know, I think that's going to be very difficult for a number of Democrats [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=194.84s)]
*  at this point, because, like you said, Musk and Trump are politically and culturally [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=199.76000000000002s)]
*  aligned here. I think it's hard for a lot of it would be hard for a lot of Democrats [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=205.24s)]
*  to jump on board, particularly in the wake of these mass, you know, doge cuts and, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=209.60000000000002s)]
*  you know, Elon Musk's role in really trying to reduce the size of the federal [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=215.24s)]
*  government. The question I have politically, though, is less about what, you know, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=219.60000000000002s)]
*  him potentially funding Democratic challengers, but potentially maybe [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=224.12s)]
*  conservative or Republican challengers, you know, people who might be aligned with, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=228.12s)]
*  let's say, Ron Johnson, who are pushing back against the size of that so-called [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=232.56s)]
*  big, beautiful bill. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=236.84s)]
*  Yeah. And certainly Johnson has company there, right? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=238.0s)]
*  There's plenty of House Republicans who were strong armed into voting for this [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=240.84s)]
*  the first time. There's an open question of maybe they get a little bit more oomph [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=244.64000000000001s)]
*  behind their complaints because of someone like Musk. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=248.48000000000002s)]
*  But I want to kind of stay on the campaign politics of it for one second, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=251.92s)]
*  because we've seen Musk be a pretty salient political point for Democrats. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=255.92s)]
*  I know it's a limited set of information, but Wisconsin, Florida, that was the height [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=260.8s)]
*  of Musk and Doge in your conversations with Democratic strategists. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=264.56s)]
*  Do they still see that as something that they want to play up, even though Musk has [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=268.4s)]
*  made an about face on this key piece of legislation? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=272.24s)]
*  You know, I think to an extent, I think Democrats and Republicans, I actually talk [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=275.4s)]
*  to sort of downplay Musk's influence politically when it comes to elections. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=280.12s)]
*  I mean, he put what? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=285.4s)]
*  One hundred thousand, two hundred thousand dollars into those Florida races. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=287.6s)]
*  But it was really special elections. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=291.4s)]
*  But it was really that Wisconsin Supreme Court race that was seen as, in a way, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=293.12s)]
*  a failure for Musk. He poured millions and millions of dollars, traveled to Wisconsin [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=297.2s)]
*  to campaign for the conservative campaigning for that seat. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=302.76s)]
*  And he ultimately failed. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=307.92s)]
*  And even though he's really pushing or last Friday or Thursday, he was saying, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=309.92s)]
*  well, Republicans wouldn't have a majority or President Trump wouldn't be president [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=315.32s)]
*  if it wasn't for me. If you actually look at Musk's record during the presidential [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=320.24s)]
*  campaign, even though he was the top individual donor, you know, not all of his [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=325.48s)]
*  endorsed candidates and congressional candidates won. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=329.71999999999997s)]
*  And we know that, you know, President Trump's campaign was in many ways a team effort, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=333.40000000000003s)]
*  you know, from Republicans across the ecosystem. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=338.64s)]
*  So I think there is a downplaying as to how much of a threat Musk could be going forward. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=341.24s)]
*  Yeah, I do hear that downplaying. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=346.04s)]
*  I also think that Democrats could have success if they continue to keep them in the [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=347.88s)]
*  spotlight. Plus, regardless of whether or not it was a team effort, a few hundred [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=351.96000000000004s)]
*  million always helps in a campaign year, especially in states like Pennsylvania. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=355.28000000000003s)]
*  Julia Manchester, thank you for joining us. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypILpVlcHsE&t=359.2s)]
