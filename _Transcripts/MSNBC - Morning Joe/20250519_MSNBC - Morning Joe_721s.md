# 'There are a lot of treatments': Fmr. Obama health advisor on Biden's cancer prognosis
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc)
*  And we'll start with this. Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=0.0s)]
*  of prostate cancer. According to his personal office, Biden, who is 82 years old, had been [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=6.4s)]
*  experiencing symptoms and was officially diagnosed on Friday. The cancer has spread from his prostate [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=13.36s)]
*  to other tissue in his body, a source familiar with the matter, tells NBC News. The Biden family is [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=21.92s)]
*  now reviewing treatment options, including hormone therapy. It's unclear where he will receive [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=28.08s)]
*  treatment, but the former president is currently at his home in Wilmington, Delaware. Several [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=34.56s)]
*  Democratic lawmakers offered their sympathies and prayers yesterday, including Kamala Harris, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=40.08s)]
*  Barack Obama, and Nancy Pelosi. President Trump also extended best wishes to the Biden family, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=46.16s)]
*  writing on social media, quote, We wish Joe a fast and successful recovery. And Joe, we've all been [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=54.32s)]
*  taking this news in incredibly sad for Joe Biden and for the family. It's very serious news when [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=63.36s)]
*  you have prostate cancer, and there are some reports that it's spread to the bones. And I [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=73.28s)]
*  think there's a lot of questions as well. Yeah, there there are. Mike Barnicle, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=79.44s)]
*  you have been a friend of Joe Biden's, have known Joe Biden for decades. Just curious [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=86.72s)]
*  your thoughts this morning. You know, Joe, it's you certainly used to being surrounded by death [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=94.0s)]
*  and dying. He's carried across for his children and his his wife, who were killed within days [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=104.0s)]
*  after he won his first election to the United States Senate in the early 1970s. He lost his son, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=111.84s)]
*  Bo, during the later parts of this, you know, the decade last decade. So he's used to the sadness. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=117.68s)]
*  And there's a permanent sadness to Joe Biden that is hard to register on this one. The diagnosis, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=127.92s)]
*  you know, I don't know enough about the diagnosis in terms of the medical future for Joe Biden. But [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  there are treatments. As Mika pointed out, the family is going to seek second opinions and further [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=141.92000000000002s)]
*  treatment options. So we'll see what happens. But he's had a tough ride these past six or seven [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=147.6s)]
*  months, both publicly and now personally. Yeah, let's bring it right out. Former Obama White House [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=155.52s)]
*  advisor for health policy oncologist Dr. Zeke Emanuel. Zeke, let's talk first of all, just based [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=161.28s)]
*  on on again, it's just scarce bit of information that you have. But prostate cancer that spread to [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=168.48000000000002s)]
*  the bone. What's what's the prognosis? Well, first of all, I want to express my sympathy and I hope [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=177.20000000000002s)]
*  Joe responds to treatment, President Biden, very well. The fact is that very few people get [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=185.28s)]
*  diagnosed this advanced. About seven percent of all prostate cancer in the country gets diagnosed [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=193.76s)]
*  when you have a lesion that's in the bone and therefore it's metastatic and incurable. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=199.36s)]
*  The prostate cancer will not go away. He will have it. That doesn't mean he's going to die from it [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=206.72s)]
*  because there are a lot of treatments. There's androgen blockade that's basically preventing [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=212.96s)]
*  the testosterone from circulating. There's also androgen receptor signaling inhibitors, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=219.36s)]
*  a second line of treatment that prevents when the androgen does bind to the cell from it doing its [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=227.12s)]
*  action and turning on genes. So there's a lot there. And then there's chemotherapy beyond that. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=232.96s)]
*  There's also treatment for that metastatic lesion near the spine if it's a threat. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=239.36s)]
*  So he has a lot of treatments and he could live a long time. We just don't know. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=244.88000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, you said that very few people have it actually diagnosed at this late stage that that's [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=251.52s)]
*  rare. Doesn't it take some time for prostate cancer to develop to a point where it would [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=259.44s)]
*  spread to the bones? Oh, he's had this for many years, maybe even a decade growing there [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=268.88s)]
*  and spreading. That's right. It's a little surprising. I look back at the records and [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=277.2s)]
*  there's no evidence that when he got his health status and the medical records were released that [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=283.76s)]
*  he had a prostate specific antigen. Now it is true that a lot of people recommend not doing a [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=291.52s)]
*  prostate specific antigen after 70, but President Biden's been in public life a very long time. He [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=297.76s)]
*  was vice president and had a lot of exams under 70. So it's a little surprising that they didn't [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=304.24s)]
*  do it and maybe President Biden decided he didn't want the test. Many men do decide they don't want [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=310.47999999999996s)]
*  a PSA, but this is it is also aggressive. When we talk about aggressive, part of what we mean is [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=315.28s)]
*  that Gleason score, that score is from two, well it's two up to 10 and he's at a nine and that means [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=323.03999999999996s)]
*  that the cancer doesn't look normal. It looks very abnormal, which is probably why it's in the [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=333.67999999999995s)]
*  bone and as you point out Joe, it's been around for a very long time in President Biden years, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=340.16s)]
*  exactly how many we don't know obviously and it is a little surprising to many of us oncologists [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=347.20000000000005s)]
*  that he wasn't diagnosed earlier. So you had said that some men do not get prostate exams [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=353.12s)]
*  after the age of 70, but some men, most men aren't President of the United States. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=364.56s)]
*  If you were a president's physician and trying to figure out how the state of his health and [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=372.96s)]
*  how he was doing, would this not seem to be a very normal routine test that you would [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=382.72s)]
*  insist the president have? Well it's a complicated area, so because it's slow going, a lot of people [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=391.6s)]
*  say unless the individual has 10 or more years to live, you know, estimate it, that you don't do this [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=399.76000000000005s)]
*  test and then if they do, you have a discussion with them about whether to actually perform the [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=408.64000000000004s)]
*  test. I don't know what happened in that discussion. There are people and I'm actually one of them [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=414.88s)]
*  that would say I don't want to see that test because part of that test is you get a lot of [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=419.84s)]
*  over treatment, it's not a very accurate test. Sometimes people say take the test and then you [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=425.59999999999997s)]
*  can do an MRI to evaluate whether if you get a high score, whether in fact there is cancer, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=431.91999999999996s)]
*  there are a lesion that would require biopsying. So there's a lot of recommendation to discuss it. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=441.2s)]
*  I don't know what President Biden and his doctor discussed, but I think you are hinting at the other [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=447.36s)]
*  element, which is that President Obama had this test, President Bush had this test. It is a little [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=452.64s)]
*  surprising that the doctor didn't take it and if he took it and didn't report it and it was elevated, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=458.72s)]
*  that is another case of doctors not being straightforward with us. We've had several [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=465.28000000000003s)]
*  of them with President Trump, especially around his COVID diagnosis and if that is true, that would [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=471.44s)]
*  be very troubling. Again, Zeke, you're an oncologist, obviously incredibly respected. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=479.12s)]
*  You believe that it is likely, just for those just tuning in, you believe it is likely if [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=490.96s)]
*  this prostate cancer has spread to the bone that he could have had it for up to a decade, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=498.24s)]
*  but certainly it's likely, would it be fair to say it's likely to have had this for at least [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=505.44s)]
*  several years? Oh, more than several years. You don't get prostate cancer. Again, I just want to [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=514.16s)]
*  stop you. So this is not speculation. If you have prostate cancer that has spread to the [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=521.44s)]
*  bone, then he's most certainly, you are saying had it when he was President of the United States. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=528.16s)]
*  Oh yeah. He did not develop it in the last 100, 200 days. He had it while he was President. He [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=535.28s)]
*  probably had it at the start of his presidency in 2021. Yes, I don't think there's any disagreement [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=542.24s)]
*  about that. And I'm just curious again, if your doctor to President of the United States that is [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=551.76s)]
*  a male, that is an older man, would prostate tests, and again we're just talking about a PSA [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=563.76s)]
*  screening, a blood test that you could do along with all the other blood tests, it's not even that [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=572.4s)]
*  it would be intrusive, would this not be one of the first tests that you would conduct [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=578.08s)]
*  as a White House doctor? If you're a White House doctor in this situation, I think you would [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=585.84s)]
*  certainly discuss it with the President and talk about the pros and cons. I think if you then ask, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=593.84s)]
*  well, if President Biden says, well, if I'm your father, which patients often do, you know, what [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=600.64s)]
*  would you recommend? I think the fact is that most White House doctors would recommend getting [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=606.56s)]
*  the test. And again, the evidence is, look at President Obama, President Bush, younger than [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=612.3199999999999s)]
*  President Biden, and they both got the test. There was some criticism when President Obama got the [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=619.92s)]
*  test that he got it too young and things. But I think in this case, especially for the President, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=626.88s)]
*  thinking that he's going to live another decade, you would probably, you would recommend to him [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=633.68s)]
*  to get the test. Now, I want to say there's people, and I'm one of them, that are sort of [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=639.1999999999999s)]
*  skeptical of this test and don't really want to have this test. But that is quite common. And I [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=645.5999999999999s)]
*  should say I have had this test mostly to get insurance, interestingly enough. If you apply [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=652.88s)]
*  for insurance, this is one of the tests that they require, just like an HIV test and cholesterol [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=658.72s)]
*  screening tests and other things. So I think your speculation, Joe, while most White House doctors [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=665.6800000000001s)]
*  would recommend this test to the President and would say, I think you should get it, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=671.9200000000001s)]
*  is probably true. Now, the President has the ultimate decision. They just can't take his [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=678.24s)]
*  blood and not talk to him about it. Yeah, but certainly, especially if you're, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=682.96s)]
*  we're not even talking about living another 10 years, we're talking about the decision to run [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=689.6s)]
*  another four years, certainly this would be a test that would need to be taken. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe1qOoXNPc&t=693.6800000000001s)]
