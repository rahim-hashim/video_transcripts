# Everyone has right to protest peacefully but 'we will not tolerate' chaos: NYPD commissioner
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8)
*  Protests against immigration enforcement now stretch from coast to coast. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=0.0s)]
*  Activists in New York, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Atlanta, and elsewhere have gathered to protest [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=4.0s)]
*  the Trump administration's tough stance on immigrants and its aggressive roundup efforts. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=9.44s)]
*  NBC News has counted at least 25 rallies and demonstrations in cities across the United States [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  since Monday, with more planned in the coming days. That includes hundreds of protesters [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  who gathered yesterday in Lower Manhattan near a large government building that houses [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=25.52s)]
*  federal immigration offices in the city's main immigration court. Join us now here in studio, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=29.36s)]
*  New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch. Commissioner Tisch, good to see you. Thanks for [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=34.8s)]
*  being here. Thank you for having me. We see what's playing out in Los Angeles right now. We can talk [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=38.96s)]
*  about that in a minute, but let's stay here in New York. What was it like down in Lower Manhattan [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=43.28s)]
*  last night and yesterday, and what are you expecting in the days ahead? You know, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=48.16s)]
*  the NYPD has been dealing with daily protests really since October 7th of 2023. Last night, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=51.36s)]
*  we had one in Lower Manhattan around Foley Square, which is, as you mentioned, near where [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=58.8s)]
*  the federal building is. In total, we saw about 2,500 people, largely peaceful. We did have a group [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=64.72s)]
*  of about 200 who were looking to sow a little chaos and disorder, and at the New York City Police [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=72.56s)]
*  Department, we will not tolerate that. We made about 86 arrests. Our cops did an incredible job. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=78.47999999999999s)]
*  They made sure that everyone has the right to protest peacefully, but if things get out of hand, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=84.08s)]
*  you break the law, they'll step in and make arrests, and that's exactly what they did quickly and [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=89.52s)]
*  swiftly. I don't think anyone has any doubt that the New York City Police Department could handle [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  widespread protests, but if, for example, President Trump were watching from his Oval Office and saw [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=98.16s)]
*  a few images of violence, windows being broken, things that looked like civil disobedience or [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=104.56s)]
*  riots in New York, and said, I'm sending in the National Guard, what would be your reaction to that? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=110.16s)]
*  Yeah, you know, watching what was going on in California, I spent the weekend on the phone with [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=115.11999999999999s)]
*  our federal partners in New York City, the head of the FBI in New York, Federal Protective Services, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  Homeland Security Investigations, and the message that I delivered to them was very clear. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=125.12s)]
*  At the New York City Police Department, we are expert in policing protests. We have lots of [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=129.68s)]
*  practice at it, and our cops are the best of the world. It is our responsibility to maintain safety [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=135.84s)]
*  and order on our streets, and we will not abdicate that responsibility. So have you learned anything [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=141.6s)]
*  watching what's happening in Los Angeles take any lessons away if the protests in New York get bigger, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=146.24s)]
*  which they may on Saturday, there's a large event planned. What do you take away from these images? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=151.76s)]
*  Yeah, you know, in New York City, we have a special unit called our Strategic Response Group, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=156.16s)]
*  and what this unit of several hundred cops does professionally all day, every day, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=162.24s)]
*  is police and work with protesters, and so they are really expert in it. Generally, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=167.44s)]
*  we'll have a heads up about where protests are going to occur. We have a lot of practice and [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=173.68s)]
*  experience, and so these cops in our Strategic Response Group really know how it's done, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=179.36s)]
*  and we've spent the weekend seeing what was going on in LA, organizing the rest of the department [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=185.68s)]
*  so that if we have to call on other resources, additional resources, that we can bring them in [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=190.88s)]
*  swiftly. So the Trump administration is blaming the incidents at Los Angeles on protesters against [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=196.16s)]
*  ICE agents who were working there in the city, on the outskirts of the city, and now the National [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=202.24s)]
*  Guard, as President Trump is saying even this morning, is needing to protect these ICE agents. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=207.04s)]
*  Can you talk to us about what's happening here in New York City when ICE agents are on the ground [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=210.56s)]
*  in the five boroughs trying to find raids, make arrests? Is NYPD consulted on that? How does the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=214.24s)]
*  operations go down, and have you seen any issues where NYPD would be needed perhaps to provide [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=220.4s)]
*  additional security? No, so in New York we have very strong sanctuary city laws, and as part of [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=225.52s)]
*  those laws, the NYPD's policy and my policy is very clear. We do not engage in civil immigration [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=230.32s)]
*  enforcement period. We don't know where ICE is in the city. We don't know when they're conducting [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=236.56s)]
*  raids. We don't know where they are conducting raids. Our responsibility is to maintain safety [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=242.48000000000002s)]
*  and order on our streets. We will not tolerate people blocking streets, people blocking [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=247.52s)]
*  entrances to buildings, people blocking cars, chaos, violence, or disorder, and we will stamp [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=252.8s)]
*  that out when it appears. So you'll tell me if I'm wrong here. So we have in the city of New York [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=258.96000000000004s)]
*  right now, in every borough, we could potentially have ICE agents masked, as they usually are, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=267.36s)]
*  going into wherever they go to extract what they claim to be here, people here illegally, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=274.88s)]
*  with no coordination between the New York Police Department? That's right. The sanctuary city [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=281.52s)]
*  dangerous. The sanctuary city laws in New York City are very clear, which is that we cannot, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=287.92s)]
*  and we do not at the New York City Police Department, participate in civil immigration [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=292.71999999999997s)]
*  enforcement. That is the law, and at the New York City Police Department, we will follow the law. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=298.48s)]
*  Our cops have done, and certainly they showed last night, is an extraordinary job ensuring safety [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=304.0s)]
*  and security in our streets, allowing people the important right to be able to protest safely, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=309.76000000000005s)]
*  but stepping in and taking action when we see chaos. I'm going to ask you generally about crime [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=315.36s)]
*  in New York City. Right now, we know murders are down. Just in this last year, violent crime is down. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=320.8s)]
*  Subways, there's a greater police presence on the subways, which makes people feel better about it, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=327.68s)]
*  and this quality of life unit, we had Mr. Shell was here with us a few weeks ago, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=332.4s)]
*  sort of rolling out that new initiative. Chief Shell was saying, effectively, if you see [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=337.76s)]
*  quality of life, little stuff on the street that's annoying in some cases or can be worse, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=343.68s)]
*  you can call a number and we're going to get on it quickly. Can you talk a little bit about the [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=348.64s)]
*  idea behind that and why you believe that's an important part of your police? Sure. In New York [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=352.96s)]
*  City, it's important, obviously, for all 8.5 million New Yorkers to be safe. It's also [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=357.76s)]
*  important for them to feel safe. And in New York, over the first five months of this year, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=362.16s)]
*  we have seen record low numbers of shootings and murders. Our cops have done an extraordinary job [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  being at the right places at the right times and really stamping out gun violence in New York City, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=375.20000000000005s)]
*  but the numbers don't tell the full story in terms of perception. And the fact of the matter is New [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=380.56s)]
*  Yorkers could see careening e-bikes, panhandling, hear loud noise, and the police need to be able to [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=386.16s)]
*  respond quickly and appropriately to those types of quality of life issues that all 8.5 million [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=395.36s)]
*  New Yorkers across all five boroughs see on a day-to-day basis. So we've reorganized a piece of the [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=402.0s)]
*  department to be able to be more responsive to 311 calls for service in much the same way we have [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=408.56s)]
*  long been responsive to 911 calls for service. Yes, it's not some of the smaller stuff you see, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=415.12s)]
*  which does add up to a feeling about the city. It's all about the feeling of safety. All right, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=420.32s)]
*  New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch will be watching these protests closely this week. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=424.88s)]
*  Thanks for being here. We appreciate it. Thank you for having me. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75FxWYerSx8&t=429.12s)]
