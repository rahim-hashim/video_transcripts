# 'The White House has bullied Amazon': WSJ editorial board rips Trump
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw)
*  So Amazon says it will not display additional tariff costs next to the product prices on [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=0.0s)]
*  its site. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=6.48s)]
*  Despite a report, the company would be doing so. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=7.48s)]
*  Punchbowl reported yesterday the retail giant would post import charges for some items as [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  a transparent way to show why some prices have gone up. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  Hours later, during a press briefing, press secretary Caroline Levitt called the reported [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=21.28s)]
*  move by Amazon a, quote, hustle and political act. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=26.8s)]
*  The White House later confirmed President Trump had called Amazon chief Jeff Bezos yesterday [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=31.32s)]
*  morning to express his displeasure over the report about Amazon displaying tariff costs [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=36.18s)]
*  on its site. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=42.760000000000005s)]
*  Jeff Bezos was very nice. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  He was terrific. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=47.96s)]
*  He solved the problem very quickly. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=49.8s)]
*  And he did the right thing. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  He's a good guy. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=55.040000000000006s)]
*  An Amazon spokesperson issued this statement, quote, the team that runs our ultra low cost [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=57.040000000000006s)]
*  Amazon haul store considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=62.96s)]
*  This was never approved and not going to happen. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=69.72s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal editorial board is writing this morning about all this, the piece [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=73.32000000000001s)]
*  titled Trump versus Amazon's brilliant tariff idea. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=77.2s)]
*  The journal writes this. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=80.72s)]
*  Trump says his tariffs may raise enough revenue to replace the income tax. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=82.08s)]
*  So why is he afraid to let Americans see what they're paying? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=86.4s)]
*  Instead of owning his policy, the White House has bullied Amazon to keep quiet about what [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=89.48s)]
*  it will cost. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=94.32s)]
*  The public could have used Amazon's price transparency. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=95.32s)]
*  Tariffs are taxes, and it's helpful to know how policy choices affect final prices. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=98.88s)]
*  Some shoppers might say the additional cost is worth it to support Mr. Trump's policy, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=103.52s)]
*  But there is no denying that they're paying, and everyone is better off knowing how much. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=108.42s)]
*  Like taxes, tariffs often add a precise dollar figure to a sticker price. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=113.06s)]
*  Voters who pay little attention to the macro economy will notice a direct markup on items [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=117.86s)]
*  they buy. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=122.56s)]
*  Consumers are already feeling the tariff pain, whether or not retailers quantify it on their [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=123.74000000000001s)]
*  websites. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=127.62s)]
*  White House denials won't change that, but repealing the tariffs would. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=128.82s)]
*  That is the Wall Street Journal this morning, Richard Haass. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=132.98000000000002s)]
*  So not really a plausible argument from the White House briefing room yesterday, calling [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=136.42s)]
*  Amazon a bunch of left-wing commies. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=140.38s)]
*  One of the most successful enterprises in the history of capitalism is Amazon. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=142.66s)]
*  Yes, it is capitalism, which I usually associate with the West. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=147.06s)]
*  This was, as one Wall Street firm calls it, radical transparency. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=152.7s)]
*  The White House probably could have pushed back and said, well, they're listing the immediate [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=158.22s)]
*  cost. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=161.73999999999998s)]
*  They're not talking about the long-term benefits. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=162.73999999999998s)]
*  But I thought it was really interesting what the Wall Street Journal did. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=163.73999999999998s)]
*  This is a larger point. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=166.22s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal editorial page has been a true, consistent, conservative voice. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=167.34s)]
*  And it's interesting because it highlights the difference between conservatism and this [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=172.5s)]
*  administration, which is many things, but not conservative. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=176.98s)]
*  It's not institutional. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=180.38s)]
*  It doesn't look at precedent. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=181.9s)]
*  It doesn't follow the rule of law carefully. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=183.38s)]
*  So all the things that conservatives believe in and the Wall Street Journal highlights [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=185.38s)]
*  them and the contrast, I thought again in today's paper, good for them. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=190.78s)]
*  We should note, though, that Amazon was going to list this tariff on just one part of its [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=195.56s)]
*  site, the Amazon Hall part of it, which is a little cast. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=200.08s)]
*  Amazon Hall is pretty prominently featured on anyone's Amazon page. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=202.36s)]
*  So this would have been something consumers would have seen. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=205.52s)]
*  And perhaps he would have gone from there. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=208.32s)]
*  But David French, I think the point here is we've gotten the explanation from Amazon, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=210.84s)]
*  but there's certainly a perception that this is another moment of a powerful institution, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=215.52s)]
*  a powerful person obeying what President Trump wants. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=220.08s)]
*  Bezos has really cozied up to him in the last handful of months, was there for the inauguration [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=224.51999999999998s)]
*  and the like, and has, even after the first term, drew Trump's ire quite often because [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=230.04s)]
*  of his stewardship of the Washington Post. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=236.23999999999998s)]
*  That is no longer the case. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=237.84s)]
*  So talk to us about that phenomenon, but also just the fact that the White House got so [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=238.84s)]
*  upset about this gives up the game here. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=243.56s)]
*  They know that these tariffs are going to hurt American consumers and be really unpopular [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=247.44s)]
*  and they don't want that in your face reminder of that. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=253.08s)]
*  Yeah, they absolutely don't want that reminder. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=256.08s)]
*  They want some sort of deniability with their base that there's that price increases have [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=258.2s)]
*  anything to do with the tariffs and they want the base to think that price increases are [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=262.44s)]
*  going to be due to corporate greed. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=266.44s)]
*  But what we see here is a further example of what we already knew, which was Trump views [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=268.76s)]
*  himself in this Putin ask authoritarian role. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=275.12s)]
*  And what does Putin have? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=278.12s)]
*  Putin has a bunch of oligarchs who kind of orbit around him, who are subservient to him. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=279.08000000000004s)]
*  And this is what he want the relationship he wants to create with American, wealthy [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=283.92s)]
*  American individuals and powerful American institutions. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=287.84000000000003s)]
*  He wants to create this dynamic, whereas he's the authoritarian center and all of these [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=290.6s)]
*  oligarchs and all of these wealthy institutions orbit around him. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=295.0s)]
*  The thing that's that's not surprising. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=299.04s)]
*  We all we know this. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=301.44s)]
*  But the thing that's discouraging is how many of these wealthy American institutions and [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=302.48s)]
*  how many of these wealthy American individuals seem to be entirely willing to play that role, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=306.8s)]
*  to play that subservient role around Donald Trump. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=312.2s)]
*  That is the thing that has been most surprising to me, as these people with immense wealth [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=315.36s)]
*  and immense power and immense pride consistently are bending that knee to Donald Trump. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=320.44s)]
*  And that that's the thing that's particularly alarming. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZsEoLUODw&t=326.6s)]
