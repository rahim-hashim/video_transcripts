# Protest peacefully but please keep protesting: Senator makes plea to Los Angeles
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60)
*  It's 20 minutes past the top of the hour. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=0.0s)]
*  Jonathan Lemire just watched your extensive interview with Tom Homan. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=4.46s)]
*  What stood out to you, do you think, in his comments? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=9.4s)]
*  There are a few things here, of course. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=12.06s)]
*  He sort of tried to deflect a lot of the criticism of the raids, suggesting that also the National [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=14.72s)]
*  Guard, he and his estimation was warranted in its deployment there, even though we have [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=21.0s)]
*  heard the governor of California, who usually has authority, any state governor, has the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=25.66s)]
*  authority of the National Guard, has been explicitly not wanting them. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=29.6s)]
*  Homan disputed the idea that their presence has escalated the violence or the clashes [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=33.32s)]
*  there. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=38.52s)]
*  I think others would disagree. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=39.52s)]
*  And he, of course, though, leaned in on this. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=42.08s)]
*  And we know, Mika, we talk about this show all the time, that this administration, their [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=43.800000000000004s)]
*  reflexive instinct, when they want, they feel like they're on their strongest footing when [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=47.16s)]
*  they talk about immigration. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=51.16s)]
*  He also brought in some news here that there were some perhaps criminal charges connected [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  to some of these arrests. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=57.28s)]
*  So let's get reaction to that from Democratic Senator Alex Padilla of California. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=58.96s)]
*  Senator Padilla, with a lot of ground to cover with you this morning, we really appreciate [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=62.64s)]
*  you being with us. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=65.54s)]
*  But let's start there. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=66.54s)]
*  That's sort of new information that the borders are. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=67.54s)]
*  Mr. Homan shared with us just now that some of those who were picked up by ICE in those [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=69.92s)]
*  initial raids in the fashion district of the Home Depot, he says, are wanted for major [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=74.56s)]
*  offenses. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=80.12s)]
*  Are you aware of that? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=81.12s)]
*  What is your reaction to what you just heard from Mr. Homan? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=82.22s)]
*  Look, this administration has been anything but forthcoming and transparent with information [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=85.68s)]
*  as it pertains to immigration enforcement, not just here in Los Angeles, but since he [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=92.36s)]
*  took office on January 20th and everywhere in between. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=97.24000000000001s)]
*  So it is absolutely frustrating. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=102.18s)]
*  Let's just take a step back here for a second, because there's clearly not just hundreds, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=104.36s)]
*  but thousands of folks that have been detained and deported over the last several months. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=108.80000000000001s)]
*  In that group, are there possibly some violent criminals or dangerous criminals? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=113.72s)]
*  Of course, nobody is contesting them being a priority. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=118.55999999999999s)]
*  But long gone are the days that Donald Trump said that would be the only focus. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=123.32s)]
*  What we keep hearing is story after story of a working mother or father being detained [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=128.0s)]
*  and deported with no criminal history. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=136.04s)]
*  This happened to be in the United States undocumented stories of a four-year-old girl receiving [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=138.16s)]
*  life-saving treatment that has been notified for deportation. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=144.2s)]
*  They've, of course, since reversed that because of public pressure. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=148.2s)]
*  But to say that they're only targeting violent criminals is false. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=151.96s)]
*  And that's what has so many people upset. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=156.26s)]
*  That and their choosing to ignore due process in a lot of these cases as well that they've [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=159.72s)]
*  been sued. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=165.68s)]
*  They've been sued for those lawsuits, but they continue to defy court orders just with [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=167.48000000000002s)]
*  their obsession of being cruel and aggressive. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=171.8s)]
*  Yeah, actually, Mr. Homan acknowledged that they were going after more than just criminals. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=174.48000000000002s)]
*  They said they'd try to penetrate the shield of a sanctuary city. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=179.36s)]
*  He also defended the use of the National Guard in this moment. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=182.88s)]
*  But we have heard from the governor, from the mayor, from the police commissioner, all [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=186.84s)]
*  saying that the vast, vast majority of the protesters there have been peaceful. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=190.28s)]
*  They condemn any of those that are violent, but they say they're few and far between. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=195.18s)]
*  What do you say here about the use of the National Guard, these troops, on the streets [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=198.98000000000002s)]
*  of an American city? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=203.58s)]
*  Look, I agree 100%. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=204.58s)]
*  The vast majority of protesters and demonstrators are peaceful. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=207.06s)]
*  They're passionate. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=213.26000000000002s)]
*  When you come into a community like Los Angeles, the way that the Trump administration has, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=214.86s)]
*  you need to expect to be countered with people who are passionate about defending fundamental [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=220.46s)]
*  rights, about standing up for due process. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=225.26000000000002s)]
*  Sadly, there are folks who will exploit the situation. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=228.06s)]
*  So yeah, the vandalism, the violence, that has no place. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=230.70000000000002s)]
*  It's counterproductive. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=234.56s)]
*  But let's focus on what's going on here. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=235.56s)]
*  The National Guard is your question. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=238.54000000000002s)]
*  This is the first time since 1965 that the National Guard has been federalized and deployed [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=240.56s)]
*  against the wishes of state and local authorities. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=246.14000000000001s)]
*  When was the last time when President LBJ sent troops into the South during the civil [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=249.7s)]
*  rights movement to defend civil rights protesters? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=255.61999999999998s)]
*  This is sort of a complete 180 from that. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=259.7s)]
*  Look, Los Angeles Police Department, I've been in touch with Chief McDonnell. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=262.42s)]
*  Los Angeles Sheriff's Department, I've been in touch with Sheriff Luna. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=266.09999999999997s)]
*  They know how to handle demonstrations. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=269.7s)]
*  They know how to handle protests. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=271.46s)]
*  They know how to handle parades and rallies and everything else. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=273.02s)]
*  Let them do their job. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=276.56s)]
*  But the National Guard shows up without a clear mission, because there's not a clear [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=278.06s)]
*  mission that has been communicated to local authorities. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=282.08000000000004s)]
*  That creates confusion. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=285.26s)]
*  That creates tension. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=286.58000000000004s)]
*  That's what has escalated the situation that Donald Trump is now using that as a justification [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=287.58000000000004s)]
*  to escalate even more. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=293.08000000000004s)]
*  So my next question, Senator, is twofold. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=296.42s)]
*  Is your message to protesters, don't be played? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=299.86s)]
*  Be peaceful. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=304.7s)]
*  Or what is your message to protesters? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=308.02s)]
*  And then are there any legal avenues that you and other elected officials are pursuing? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=309.96s)]
*  So a couple of messages out there. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=315.94s)]
*  Number one, this is personal for me. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=318.26s)]
*  Not only is Los Angeles my home, anybody who knows me, I'm a proud son of immigrants. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=320.21999999999997s)]
*  My parents came to the United States. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=324.85999999999996s)]
*  They came to Los Angeles in pursuit of the American dream, like so many others. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=326.85999999999996s)]
*  I was born and raised there, proud of the public schools, and now have the honor of [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=331.5s)]
*  representing California in the United States Senate. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=335.42s)]
*  So I know the immigrant story because of the community where I grew up. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=338.5s)]
*  The protesters that are out there, thank you. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=342.46000000000004s)]
*  Please keep protesting. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=345.06s)]
*  Protest peacefully. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=347.02000000000004s)]
*  But please keep protesting, because Donald Trump wants one of two things. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=348.20000000000005s)]
*  He either wants people to stay quiet, to cower, and just look the other way, while he continues [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=351.38s)]
*  to overreach, overreach, and abuse his authority, or he wants us to overreact and give him a [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=356.42s)]
*  license to continue the escalation. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=361.62s)]
*  So don't do that. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=363.86s)]
*  We have to protest. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=364.9s)]
*  Keep using your voices, absolutely. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=366.41999999999996s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=368.53999999999996s)]
*  Democratic Senator Alex Padilla of California, thank you very much for coming on the show [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=370.14s)]
*  this morning. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=374.78s)]
*  We look forward to more updates from you. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=375.78s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=377.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=378.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS5ENdvs60&t=394.9s)]
