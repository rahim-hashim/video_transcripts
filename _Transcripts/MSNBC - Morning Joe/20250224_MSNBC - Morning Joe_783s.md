# 'The center has barely held': Far-right surges in German elections
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA)
*  All right, overseas, Germany's Christian Democrats, the nation's center-right party, has won that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=0.0s)]
*  country's federal election. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  The party's leader, Friedrich Merz, is likely to become the nation's next chancellor, with [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=8.24s)]
*  his party securing 208 seats and roughly 29 percent of the vote. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=13.84s)]
*  The campaign's focus was dominated by longstanding concerns over Germany's economy and immigration [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=19.8s)]
*  policy. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=26.76s)]
*  The current chancellor, Olaf Scholz's left-leaning party, finished in third place with just 120 [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=27.76s)]
*  seats and 16 percent of the vote. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=34.56s)]
*  The nation's far-right AFD party finished in second place, winning 152 seats and roughly [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=37.08s)]
*  21 percent of the vote, nearly double its margin from the last federal election in 2021. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=42.56s)]
*  Let's bring in former editor of the Financial Times, Lionel Barber, live from Brussels, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=50.84s)]
*  where the EU holds most of its key meetings. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=56.64s)]
*  And staff writer at the Atlantic, Rem Wood, as Liz Peace posted just before the election, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=59.84s)]
*  is entitled, Germany's anti-extremist firewall is collapsing. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=65.04s)]
*  Thank you all both so much for being with us. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=70.8s)]
*  Lionel, why don't we start with you? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=72.6s)]
*  You have the most fascinating shot of all. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=75.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=77.32000000000001s)]
*  And you were also in Brussels, the de facto capital of Europe. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=78.32000000000001s)]
*  You know, there was a belief that perhaps because Musk, Vance and others were leaning [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=82.72000000000001s)]
*  in and trying to support AFD that they would do much better than the 20 percent that they've [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=87.56s)]
*  been projecting for the past several weeks. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  I'm wondering, is this another example, as we've seen in France with the last two elections [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=95.64000000000001s)]
*  of Macron, where the center is held? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=100.44000000000001s)]
*  We have that centrist grand coalition holding things together in Germany for the next few [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=103.04s)]
*  years. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=109.64000000000001s)]
*  What are your thoughts? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=110.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, the center has barely held because the CDU, as you say, didn't get over 30 percent [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=112.52s)]
*  of the vote. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=119.92s)]
*  It's a disaster for Olaf, the bookmaker, the spreadsheet guy, Schultz, the chancellor. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=120.92s)]
*  His party, center-left, got around 15, 16 percent of the vote. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=129.28s)]
*  And the hard right, they doubled their vote share compared to four years ago. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=134.72s)]
*  Now, that means that the AFD, backed by Musk and I think more than a few others in the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=140.6s)]
*  Trump administration, are now the opposition. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=146.48s)]
*  However, here's the sliver of good news. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=150.12s)]
*  There is likely to be a centrist, what they call a grand coalition between center-right, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=153.44s)]
*  center-left and sort of right, which will keep out the AFD. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=160.04s)]
*  Something to watch. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=165.04s)]
*  Will Elon Musk say that there should be, that the AFD deserves to come into government? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=166.16s)]
*  That would be a shocker. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=172.12s)]
*  Well, it looks like Elon Musk interfering in Germany's elections worked about as effectively [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=174.12s)]
*  as a German politician trying to tell people in Peoria, Illinois, how to vote. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=183.8s)]
*  I'm wondering also, while we're looking at good news here, I'm wondering whether [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=190.84s)]
*  the business community may think it's good news that a pro-business German leader is [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  now in charge because the German economy is right now struggling as much as it is, number one. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=202.72s)]
*  And number two, we played a clip earlier in this show of 10 years of warning from Morning Joe [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=209.76s)]
*  that the EU's immigration policy was too lax and it would lead to the rise of far-right parties. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=217.76s)]
*  I'm wondering if Merkel is not feeling that void now, not being a far-right conservative, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=225.07999999999998s)]
*  but at least speaking to the concerns of Germans after Merkel brought in a million Syrian refugees [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=232.2s)]
*  without even screening most of them. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=241.48s)]
*  Well, Joe, you're dead right about the handling of immigration. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=245.0s)]
*  And the government actually in Germany has already suspended Schengen, the free movement [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=249.51999999999998s)]
*  of people within the EU and into Germany. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=255.84s)]
*  And there are going to be much tighter immigration measures. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=259.52s)]
*  And the success of the hard right is definitely due to fears about immigration, also crime. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=263.59999999999997s)]
*  Now, to answer your question, we're not in Washington here where President Trump has [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=271.84s)]
*  got total fealty for the moment from the Republican Party. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=278.8s)]
*  He's got all his nominees through. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=283.6s)]
*  You were talking about Cash Patel and others, Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=285.28000000000003s)]
*  With Germany, Mr. Mertz, chancellor-elect Mertz, is going to have to negotiate a coalition. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=289.04s)]
*  And that will be, if it's with the centre-left, what the business community are looking for is, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=297.12s)]
*  can he actually push through economic reforms? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=302.24s)]
*  Can he get a release on the debt break, which is like a balanced budget amendment, it's a law, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=305.91999999999996s)]
*  which is preventing investment? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=312.56s)]
*  I mean, Joe, Mika, the German trains don't even run on time as well as the British. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=314.32s)]
*  We're in a terrible state regarding German infrastructure. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=320.64s)]
*  Well, the trains had always been, of course, the line there. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=325.03999999999996s)]
*  Graham, you were covering for a while now the rise of the AFD. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=328.88s)]
*  In fact, you spent time in Germany. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=335.2s)]
*  You even attended at least one of their rallies. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=336.56s)]
*  You did a deep dive. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=339.03999999999996s)]
*  It's on the Atlantic site now, a must-read. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=339.84s)]
*  Tell us a little bit about what you learned there and the party's new and growing role in that country. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=343.28s)]
*  And the main thing I learned was that the AFD was aiming its fire at the CDU, at the centre-right. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=351.03999999999996s)]
*  I mean, the AFD was saying the centre-right, which just won this election, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=356.48s)]
*  has to be destroyed, totally dismantled. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=360.64s)]
*  They invoked Trump, they invoked Elon Musk, and they said they led the way. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=362.88s)]
*  They destroyed the GOP as it existed before, and we're going to do the same thing to the CDU. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=367.44s)]
*  Now, the CDU having won, it looks like a victory for them, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=372.08s)]
*  but the AFD also measures their victories in different ways too. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=375.68s)]
*  So getting one in five German voters for them was a huge victory [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=379.04s)]
*  because it meant that they couldn't be ignored in the future. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=383.36s)]
*  So they might be shut out of government. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=385.44s)]
*  They're very likely to be shut out of government. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=388.0s)]
*  But what they were afraid of was that they would have a showing that would be poor enough [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=390.0s)]
*  that they could actually be banned as a party, be investigated by law enforcement. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=394.48s)]
*  And what they've got is a showing that makes it impossible for them to be completely ignored politically. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=399.04s)]
*  So Graham, talk about the people you met at the AFD rally. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=405.04s)]
*  I mean, there's a kind of a slightly easy language in which this is the inheritors of the [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=408.48s)]
*  fascist party and is racist, anti-Islam, homophobic. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=415.68s)]
*  The people you met and talked to, how did they feel about that perception of them? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=423.12s)]
*  They were sincerely offended by it. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=429.76000000000005s)]
*  There have been many cases where AFD supporters, AFD members have said things that [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=432.72s)]
*  charitably we could say were neutral about the history of Germany and about the SS. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=439.44s)]
*  So AFD has quite a lot to answer for. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=445.12s)]
*  At most of the rallies that I went to, and I went to some of the strongholds of the AFD [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=449.04s)]
*  and went to their political rallies, there were no racial slurs that were used. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=452.56s)]
*  There was more anger directed toward actually toward the center-right politicians of Germany [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=457.6s)]
*  than toward immigrants. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=462.48s)]
*  But look, this is a party that adopted as a slogan, Alice for Deutschland. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=463.6s)]
*  Alice is the name of the leader of the party. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=469.28000000000003s)]
*  Alice for Deutschland is also one of the mottos of the storm troopers of Nazi Germany. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=471.44s)]
*  So they seem to kind of encourage a bit of ambiguities and dog whistles, some understanding [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=477.04s)]
*  that even if we're going to be personally not racist, personally not offended in many cases, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=483.52s)]
*  the party as a whole is okay with some of the iconography, some of the symbolism of Naziism. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=489.44s)]
*  That's a very unsettling thing to hear when spoken, especially in German. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=494.72s)]
*  So Graham, that's the backdrop here, right? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=498.56s)]
*  They may be trying to project a little more professionalism, but the underpinnings are [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=500.72s)]
*  all there, very disturbing, as you say. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=504.56s)]
*  So how would you forecast now coming off of what for them was a remarkable showing this [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=506.40000000000003s)]
*  weekend, even if a little less than maybe some of them had hoped or that Elon Musk and [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=511.44000000000005s)]
*  JD Vance perhaps had hoped, how do you foresee the role they'll play going forward now with [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=515.76s)]
*  this new government in place in Germany? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=521.0400000000001s)]
*  So I think you can look at some of the states where they have been very popular. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=522.72s)]
*  So I was in the state of Thuringia, one of the places where they've been most popular [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=525.44s)]
*  in the past. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=528.88s)]
*  In fact, in state parliament, they won a plurality of votes there, but they were not in government [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=529.36s)]
*  because all the other parties joined a coalition against them and made them just shut them [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=534.16s)]
*  out. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=539.12s)]
*  So what was the effect of that? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=539.6s)]
*  Supporters of the AFD were angrier than ever. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=541.52s)]
*  Their view was even when we win, we lose. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=544.88s)]
*  So now that they haven't got enough of a share of the federal parliament to actually be in [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=547.44s)]
*  government, to be most likely in government in any coalition, they're still going to feel [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=553.44s)]
*  like they've been shut out. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=557.04s)]
*  So I feel like this is sort of a reckoning postponed with the AFD and the rise of the [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=558.24s)]
*  far right in Germany because their supporters are going to look at their fairly strong showing, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=562.72s)]
*  a stronger showing than ever before, and see that they're still being shut out. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=568.4s)]
*  And that's going to make them mad. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=572.72s)]
*  And whenever the next reckoning comes, the real reckoning, it's going to be pretty severe. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=574.0s)]
*  And of course, there's stronger showing in East Germany, former East Germany. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=578.8s)]
*  Seth Reiter for the Atlantic, Graham Wood. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=583.84s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=585.6800000000001s)]
*  His latest piece is available to read online now. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=586.4s)]
*  Lionel, back to you in Brussels. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=589.76s)]
*  Let's talk about Europe's response to Ukraine, the growing Ukraine crisis on the third anniversary [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=592.0s)]
*  of the war. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=598.48s)]
*  I've been showing the Wall Street Journal editorial talking about all the times Vladimir [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=599.36s)]
*  Putin has lied to American leaders. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=603.68s)]
*  We've of course had Murdoch's Wall Street Journal editorial page, the New York Post, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=607.12s)]
*  even some on Fox News striking out against Vladimir Putin saying clearly he is the dictator [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=614.56s)]
*  who began the invasion. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=622.0s)]
*  And yet Republicans, Republican senators, for the most part, strangely silent. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=623.1999999999999s)]
*  How's that being received in Europe? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=629.28s)]
*  And what does it mean long term for the EU's relationship, not only with the United States, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=631.3599999999999s)]
*  but also its relationship towards the idea of defending itself now without the help of [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=637.04s)]
*  the United States? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=642.88s)]
*  Right now, Joe, the biggest concern in Europe is that we just won't have a seat at the table [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=645.28s)]
*  when the future of Ukraine and the security guarantees or not and the future economics [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=653.28s)]
*  of Ukraine will be discussed at the moment. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=659.76s)]
*  It's a US-Russian discussion, a Trump-Putin discussion. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=663.04s)]
*  And there's a big contrast with, for example, 1989, 1990, after the fall of the German [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=668.5600000000001s)]
*  War, Berlin War, the Bush administration went to great efforts to bring the Europeans on [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=674.64s)]
*  board and actually strike a partnership of equal system, in their words, with Helmut [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=682.72s)]
*  Kohl of Germany. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=688.64s)]
*  Right now, Germany has been treated as an adversary. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=690.4s)]
*  The thing to watch is this week, President Macron will have talks with President Trump [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=693.84s)]
*  and our own Keir Starmer. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=699.76s)]
*  What's he going to say? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=702.08s)]
*  Well, he will, I believe, send a message. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=703.6s)]
*  If you get this wrong, this could be like Afghanistan, the retreat. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=706.4s)]
*  It could be chaos. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=711.2s)]
*  So be careful what you wish for. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=712.64s)]
*  Dismay, in other words, that so many people in the Republican Party and in Maga are not [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=715.92s)]
*  prepared to say the word dictator when it comes to President Putin and instead want [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=721.44s)]
*  to cozy up. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=727.12s)]
*  You know, that is, of course, distressing. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=729.0400000000001s)]
*  I will say interesting. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=732.6400000000001s)]
*  Two people who you would not normally put together, Keir Starmer and Lindsey Graham [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=734.5600000000001s)]
*  of South Carolina, issuing the same warning, Lindsey Graham letting Donald Trump know [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=739.7600000000001s)]
*  that if you think Afghanistan was bad, the retreat from Afghanistan, just wait. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=746.24s)]
*  That will be nothing compared to Ukraine if you turn it over to Vladimir Putin. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=751.28s)]
*  And France's Emmanuel Macron is actually at the White House right now as we speak. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2smg9MtkGA&t=756.9599999999999s)]
