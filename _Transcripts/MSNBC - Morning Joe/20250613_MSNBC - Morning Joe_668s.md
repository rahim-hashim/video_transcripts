# An operation 'years in the planning': Fmr. Israeli ambassador on strikes
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0)
*  Moments ago, the Israeli military struck an Iranian nuclear facility that's according [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=0.0s)]
*  to state media reports there. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=4.96s)]
*  It comes after a series of overnight strikes against Iran that killed at least three of [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=6.68s)]
*  its senior military leaders. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=11.56s)]
*  Those strikes, which the Israeli military said involved more than 200 fighter jets, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  were aimed at Iran's main enrichment facility and scientists working on Iran's nuclear program. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=17.76s)]
*  In response, Iran launched more than 100 drones toward Israeli territory early this morning. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=23.8s)]
*  Iran's foreign minister said the Israeli attack violates the UN's charter and that Iran has [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=29.84s)]
*  a legal right to respond. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=36.44s)]
*  This dramatic escalation overnight comes as the United States had been urging Israel to [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=38.4s)]
*  hold off on any attacks as the Trump administration continues its talks with Iran on that rapidly [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=42.96s)]
*  advancing nuclear program. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=49.24s)]
*  In a true social post early this morning, President Trump wrote he had given Iran chance [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=51.44s)]
*  after chance to make a deal on its nuclear capabilities. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=56.519999999999996s)]
*  He added, Iran must make a deal before there is nothing left, warning the next planned [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=59.8s)]
*  attacks will be, quote, even more brutal. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=64.6s)]
*  The United States, though, said it is not involved in the overnight attack and that [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=67.92s)]
*  it's not providing any assistance to Israel. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=72.16s)]
*  We're now learning how Israel carried out the attacks. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=75.28s)]
*  According to reports and several Israeli outlets citing a source, the Mossad spy agency reportedly [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=78.4s)]
*  began smuggling missiles into Iran several months ago and then secretly installed explosive [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=84.54s)]
*  drones deep inside the country to lay the groundwork for this overnight attack. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=90.02000000000001s)]
*  According to the Washington Post, two people with knowledge of the operation described [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=94.82000000000001s)]
*  the explosive drone plot as similar to the Ukrainian operation that destroyed Russian [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=98.78s)]
*  strategic bombers this month but said there was no coordination between Israel and Ukraine. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=103.94000000000001s)]
*  NBC News has not yet independently confirmed the details of those reports. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=109.54s)]
*  Joining us now is former Israeli Ambassador to the United States, Michael Orrin. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=114.82000000000001s)]
*  He is live from Israel. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=119.26s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador, thanks for being with us this morning. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=121.38000000000001s)]
*  What more can you tell us from what you've gathered over these last 12 hours or so about [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=124.18s)]
*  the planning of these attacks and how they were carried out? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=128.82s)]
*  Well, Willie, good morning. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=131.58s)]
*  Good morning from Israel. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=133.18s)]
*  I'm still in my safe room. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=134.18s)]
*  We all have bomb shelters in our homes, but the Israeli military has announced that we [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=136.02s)]
*  can leave these homes. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=139.54000000000002s)]
*  If you look out my window here, you can see people in the street, which means one thing [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=140.70000000000002s)]
*  and one thing only, that the threat of being pummeled by thousands of long-range Iranian [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=144.22s)]
*  ballistic missiles, each carrying warheads of 2,000 pounds of TNT, has disappeared. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=150.78s)]
*  And it means that somewhere along the line, in addition to taking out the four top military [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=156.62s)]
*  Iran, nuclear scientists, the Natanz nuclear facility and rocket launchers, somehow Israel [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=162.2s)]
*  has completely neutralized the threat against Iran. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=171.2s)]
*  That doesn't mean the rockets can't come later on, but it's an extraordinary, extraordinary [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=174.11999999999998s)]
*  moment and one that can prove utterly transformative for the entire Middle East. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=178.79999999999998s)]
*  So Ambassador, let's talk about the aims of this operation, the attack overnight. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=184.44s)]
*  We know there was an attack near a nuclear facility, a nuclear enrichment facility primarily, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=189.32s)]
*  and also just taking out the leadership of the Iranian military, the heads of the IRGC, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=195.12s)]
*  a couple of nuclear scientists as well. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=200.56s)]
*  What is the objective of this attack? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=202.76s)]
*  I think the primary objective is to remove the immediate and existential threat of a [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=206.2s)]
*  nuclear-armed Iran. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=210.51999999999998s)]
*  And Israel had received information, I think that the United States had the same information, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=212.88s)]
*  that Iran had now violated all of its commitments under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=216.72s)]
*  It was enriching uranium at 60 percent with enough nuclear fissile material to make nine [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=222.08s)]
*  nuclear weapons, and that the warhead development had advanced to a point where it could actually [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=227.88s)]
*  be weaponized and placed upon a ballistic missile. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=233.92s)]
*  And Iran has an entire fleet of ballistic missiles that are capable of carrying nuclear [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=236.72s)]
*  warheads. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=241.24s)]
*  So that was a total game changer, an existential threat to the state of Israel. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=242.24s)]
*  The U.S. reports that Iran was poised to mount multiple attacks along Israel's borders, even [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=245.32s)]
*  the Egyptian and Jordanian borders. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=250.52s)]
*  So for the Israeli government, I think this was not a very difficult choice, but clearly [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=252.12s)]
*  an operation like this was years in the planning, years in the planning, and was not made overnight. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=257.2s)]
*  And it's just beginning. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=263.4s)]
*  What I think is going to happen, really, I think it's indicated by that last tweet posted [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=264.4s)]
*  by the president, is that the Iranians are going to be quietly crying uncle to the United [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=269.6s)]
*  States, telling the United States, you know, haul off the Israelis, and we're willing to [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=273.6s)]
*  go back to the negotiating table and talk about dismantling nuclear facilities that [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=276.56s)]
*  are already dismantled. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=280.92s)]
*  And I wouldn't be surprised if President Trump is going to be calling on Israel to start [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=283.04s)]
*  winding this down in the next maybe hours, days at most. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=287.12s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador, good morning. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=292.56s)]
*  In the days before the strike, some U.S. intelligence officials were skeptical of the claim that [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=294.2s)]
*  Iran was ready to strike at Israel and other partners in the region. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=298.12s)]
*  And you're certainly right. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=302.8s)]
*  President Trump in his post just now, and we've heard from him for weeks now, including [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=304.15999999999997s)]
*  in his phone call with Prime Minister Netanyahu on Monday, said he really wanted a diplomatic [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=308.64s)]
*  solution here. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=312.64s)]
*  He still believes in the possibility of getting to the table and that talks would get a deal [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=313.64s)]
*  done. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=317.56s)]
*  In fact, he's still hoping that things will happen this weekend. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=318.56s)]
*  We'll see whether they go on as scheduled. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=320.24s)]
*  So my question to you is, why do you think Prime Minister Netanyahu, even if it wasn't [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=323.56s)]
*  outright defiance of President Trump, he clearly went his own way here and did not take the [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=327.72s)]
*  path the White House hoped he would. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=333.92s)]
*  He took the path of previous Israeli prime ministers, of Menachem Begin in 1981, who [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=337.44s)]
*  went against, who defied the will of Ronald Reagan and took out the Iraqi nuclear reaction. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=341.88s)]
*  He defied the path of Ehud Olmert in 2007, who went against the will of George Bush Jr. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=346.52s)]
*  and took out the Syrian nuclear reactor. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=352.44s)]
*  So there's plenty of precedents for this. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=354.8s)]
*  And now we're going to see whether Bibi will go on the path of Levi Eshkol, the prime minister [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=356.68s)]
*  during the 67 war, and Golda Meir, the prime minister during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, both [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=361.48s)]
*  of whom resisted American pressures to end the war prematurely until Israel had achieved [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=367.08s)]
*  its military goals. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=371.96000000000004s)]
*  And I think that's going to be the major story in the next couple of days to see whether [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=372.96000000000004s)]
*  Israel can continue this action against Iran. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=377.08s)]
*  Israel right now is striking around pretty much at will. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=381.2s)]
*  There have been no reports of Israeli losses to date. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=384.0s)]
*  And Israel is usually pretty good about reporting those losses early if they do occur. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=386.36s)]
*  The goal of this, we've got to go back to Willie's question. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=391.6s)]
*  What is the goal of this? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=394.0s)]
*  Okay, remove the immediate existential military threat to the state of Israel. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=395.0s)]
*  But there may be a longer term goal. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=398.78000000000003s)]
*  I personally don't see how the regime in Iran survives this. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=400.16s)]
*  They have proven to be not just a paper tiger, but a tissue tiger. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=403.8s)]
*  And they have plenty of opposition within the country. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=408.92s)]
*  This is a despised regime by a large part of the Iranian population. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=412.12s)]
*  And I think we can maybe see a big change in Iran and a change in the entire Middle [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=416.32s)]
*  East, possibly peace between Israel and Syria, Israel and Lebanon, Israel and Saudi Arabia, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=419.84000000000003s)]
*  certainly a resolution to the horrible situation in Gaza, and who knows, maybe even peace between [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=424.8s)]
*  Israel and Iran. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=431.16s)]
*  Ambassador, you seem to be suggesting that actually some sort of regime change in Iran [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=432.16s)]
*  you think could be possible out of this. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=436.32s)]
*  As you know, the Americans were due to start more talks with the Iranians this weekend. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=438.4s)]
*  That now looks almost impossible. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=443.4s)]
*  Is that, is the end of the diplomatic talks then a desirable outcome as well? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=447.28s)]
*  Is that a desirable consequence of these strikes? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=452.56s)]
*  Is that something that the Israeli government would hope would come from these strikes too, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=454.85999999999996s)]
*  to quash all chances of diplomatic negotiations? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=459.4s)]
*  Well, it's, no, I don't think so. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=462.23999999999995s)]
*  I think it's an excellent question. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=464.47999999999996s)]
*  I think short of regime change, what Israel wants is to see the dismantlement of the Iranian [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=465.8s)]
*  nuclear program and the verifiable dismantlement of that program. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=469.76s)]
*  That has been Israel's goal from the get-go. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=473.48s)]
*  I've been involved in this issue for 20 years. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=475.0s)]
*  That was always Israel's goal, not just capping the enrichment. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=476.6s)]
*  And we know that with advanced centrifuges, the capping means nothing because Iran can [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=481.02000000000004s)]
*  enrich to 60 percent en masse enough for nine bombs within a matter of months, even if they're [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=484.92s)]
*  capped. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=490.32s)]
*  So it has to be dismantled. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=491.32s)]
*  And if Iran comes back now and says, uncle, to the United States, haul off the Israelis, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=493.56s)]
*  we're willing to go back to the table and talk about dismantling, I think Israel would [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=498.8s)]
*  view that sufficiently. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=502.44s)]
*  I think in any case, Israel would want to continue this military action until Iran is [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=503.88s)]
*  completely neutralized as a threat, not just to us, but to many of our neighbors in the [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=509.53999999999996s)]
*  Middle East. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=513.1999999999999s)]
*  So, Ambassador, as you know, Iran has promised massive retaliation. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=514.1999999999999s)]
*  Unclear if it can pull that off at this point, given the military decapitation that just [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=518.0s)]
*  happened, but they will reconstitute themselves. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=522.0799999999999s)]
*  If they do, what would you expect that to look like through client states, through the [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=524.52s)]
*  terrorist organizations they support? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=528.5999999999999s)]
*  What would that look like? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=530.56s)]
*  It could look like, yes, it could be a terrorist operation not just against Israel, but against [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=531.56s)]
*  Jewish and Israeli targets abroad. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=537.0s)]
*  And I would be very cautious. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=540.12s)]
*  I'm sure there are high alerts that Israeli embassies, Jewish institutions abroad, even [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=541.28s)]
*  synagogues in the United States. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=545.5999999999999s)]
*  Don't rule that out. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=547.4399999999999s)]
*  A high level of alert. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=548.4399999999999s)]
*  But it's interesting, and I just want to reiterate the fact that we've been let out by the home [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=550.5999999999999s)]
*  command here of our bomb shelters is an extraordinary move. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=554.1199999999999s)]
*  At 2.30 in the morning, we received warnings that no Israeli has ever seen in our history. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=558.68s)]
*  It's not just a siren went off, but all of our cell phones started buzzing hysterically, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=563.68s)]
*  saying, rush to your shelters, rush to your shelters. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=568.7199999999999s)]
*  I turned to my wife and said, oh, we just attacked Iran. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=570.8399999999999s)]
*  There's all of the reason for that. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=573.4399999999999s)]
*  And we received those messages several times during the night. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=576.2399999999999s)]
*  And now the message is, it's over. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=579.72s)]
*  There's a green light. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=581.56s)]
*  You can go outside and get hummus. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=582.56s)]
*  And I just looked outside. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=585.56s)]
*  People are eating hummus. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=586.56s)]
*  That is, to me, one of the most extraordinary indications of just how far reaching and successful [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=588.36s)]
*  this military operation has been. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=594.4s)]
*  So, Ambassador, one last question for you. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=596.4s)]
*  You said a minute ago that perhaps this will bring Iran to heel in some way and perhaps [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=598.96s)]
*  even lead to peace in Gaza. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=604.12s)]
*  How would this attack or bring Iran to heel, whatever that means or whatever that looks [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=607.2s)]
*  like? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=611.84s)]
*  How does this help the path to peace in Gaza? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=612.84s)]
*  I think hummus will internalize that it's completely alone now. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=616.08s)]
*  It lost its Hezbollah ally last year. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=619.48s)]
*  Now it's lost its major patron, which is Iran. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=622.0400000000001s)]
*  And it's going to want to cut a deal as well. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=625.48s)]
*  That deal, I think, would look like the release of all the hostages, a very long-term ceasefire, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=627.5200000000001s)]
*  demilitarization of the Gaza Strip and the exile of hummus's leaders to another not particularly [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=633.8s)]
*  hospitable country. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=640.56s)]
*  Former Israeli ambassador to the United States, Michael Orrin, Ambassador, thanks for being [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=643.3199999999999s)]
*  here this morning. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=647.04s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=648.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnccGr2Von0&t=662.8s)]
