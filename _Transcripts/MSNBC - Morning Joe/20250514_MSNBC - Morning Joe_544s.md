# Trump meeting with MLB commissioner impacted Pete Rose decision, says writer
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc)
*  All right, so Major League Baseball has reinstated Pete Rose. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=0.0s)]
*  Commissioner Rob Manfred announced yesterday the all-time hits leader has been posthumously [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=3.64s)]
*  removed from the league's permanently ineligible list, paving the way for his potential election [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=8.88s)]
*  to the Hall of Fame. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=14.48s)]
*  In a letter written by Manfred and sent to the Rose family's attorney, Manfred writes [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=15.48s)]
*  this, in my view, once an individual has passed away, the purposes of Rule 21 have been served. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=19.64s)]
*  Manfred was referring to the MLB rule prohibiting gambling and other misconduct that threatens [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=25.92s)]
*  the integrity of the game, which led to Rose's decades-long ban. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=30.480000000000004s)]
*  The rule does not address what happens after a banned individual dies, leaving the door [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=34.92s)]
*  open to Manfred's interpretation. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=39.52s)]
*  Decision also applies to 16 others, including shoeless Joe Jackson and his 71919 so-called [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  Chicago Black Sox teammates who threw the World Series that year. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=50.040000000000006s)]
*  Joining us now, senior MLB writer for the Athletic, Jason Stark, and MSNBC contributor, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=54.72s)]
*  Mike Barnicle. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=60.12s)]
*  Good to see you both up. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=61.12s)]
*  So Jason, what's your read on what prompted this move from Commissioner Manfred? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=62.12s)]
*  Willie, I think it's certainly possible to connect the dots between the commissioner's [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=66.88s)]
*  meeting with Donald Trump a few weeks ago and this decision. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  Before that meeting, there had never been any indication that Rob Manfred was open to [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=79.92s)]
*  reinstating Pete Rose or any of these other men. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=85.8s)]
*  And things changed rapidly. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=89.28s)]
*  So is it possible to connect those dots? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=91.34s)]
*  I think it is. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  So I'm curious why, so you think it may be the meeting with Donald Trump. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=95.12s)]
*  I'm curious what your thought is, just in general, about what's your position been about [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=103.92s)]
*  Pete Rose? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=109.9s)]
*  Because mine's completely different than it is for some of the guys, whether it's Sosa [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=111.26s)]
*  McGuire, whose numbers were artificially elevated in a way that Bonds and Clemens, they were [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=116.5s)]
*  great even before the steroids era and probably should get in. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=125.16000000000001s)]
*  But I never quite understood Rose being kept out after all those years. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=128.1s)]
*  What was your view? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=135.62s)]
*  Well, Joe, like all the members of the baseball writers, I've never had a chance to vote on [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=137.54s)]
*  Pete Rose. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=142.44s)]
*  But it's been interesting to watch the evolution of what we think about gambling, gambling [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=143.9s)]
*  in baseball, gambling in sports through the years. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=149.22s)]
*  When Bart Giamatti announced this ban in 1989, this was viewed as the cardinal sin of baseball. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=153.74s)]
*  And within the sport, it still is. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=162.3s)]
*  You cannot bet on baseball if you work in baseball. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=163.9s)]
*  And yet, you walk into ballparks now and you can bet on the game you're going to watch [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=168.06s)]
*  right there at the ballpark. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=175.82s)]
*  And so it's blurring the lines between how great a sin this actually is now in the eyes [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=178.16s)]
*  of many people. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=184.4s)]
*  But when it comes to whether Pete Rose is going to get into the Hall of Fame, his fate [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=186.3s)]
*  is now in the hands of a committee. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=191.57999999999998s)]
*  This committee will be made up of Hall of Fame players, executives, and members of the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=195.29999999999998s)]
*  media. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=199.89999999999998s)]
*  And their opinions don't have to mirror what the public's opinions are. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=201.34s)]
*  They know everything about Pete Rose. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=210.34s)]
*  But I just wrote a column that's in the Athletic as we speak that says, by doing this, Rob [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=212.95999999999998s)]
*  Manfred is essentially telling us Pete Rose has served his time. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=219.18s)]
*  And Joe, if he served his time, doesn't that mean we should be voting on him as Pete Rose, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=224.3s)]
*  the baseball player? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=229.78s)]
*  And Pete Rose, the guy who got more hits than anybody who ever lived? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=231.28s)]
*  That would seem like a Hall of Fame player. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=234.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=236.42000000000002s)]
*  So Mike Barnicle, you've long said put Pete Rose in the Hall of Fame and put it on the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=237.42000000000002s)]
*  plaque. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=240.86s)]
*  Explain what he did alongside all of his accomplishments on the baseball field, which were many, of [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=241.86s)]
*  course, including being the all-time hits king. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=246.7s)]
*  You know the commissioner well. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=250.22s)]
*  You're very plugged into Major League Baseball. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=251.61999999999998s)]
*  What's your sense of how this all came about? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=254.06s)]
*  It remains the same. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=258.06s)]
*  Pete Rose, Shoeless Joe Jackson, a bunch of others, Bonds, Clemens, put him out on the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=259.26s)]
*  Hall of Fame, the Hall of Fame baseball players, and put it on the plaque. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=264.62s)]
*  Put the allegations on the plaque. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=268.15999999999997s)]
*  Put Pete Rose's entire career on the back. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=269.9s)]
*  Jason raised a really critical point, though. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=272.1s)]
*  In baseball, in every clubhouse, in every Major League Baseball clubhouse, there is [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=275.02s)]
*  a sign about gambling. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=278.78000000000003s)]
*  If you gamble, you're dead. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=280.58s)]
*  You're out of the game. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=281.86s)]
*  It's right there. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=282.86s)]
*  You can read it when you go in the clubhouse, any clubhouse. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=283.86s)]
*  And yet you can go sit and watch a ball game and have someone sitting in front of you or [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=286.14s)]
*  behind you betting on at-bats as the game takes place in front of us. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=290.78s)]
*  When you watch the commercials on TV, baseball games, the gambling institutions have provided [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=296.58s)]
*  so much money, advertising money, to Major League Baseball that it's kind of hypocritical [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=303.46s)]
*  to sit there and say, oh, no, no, he gambled. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=308.02s)]
*  He gambled. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=310.34s)]
*  He can't be in the Hall of Fame. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=311.34s)]
*  And yet you're taking all of this money from these gambling institutions. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=312.62s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=315.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=316.86s)]
*  I mean, given all that. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=317.86s)]
*  I mean, and Rose was such an—and I guess because I grew up watching Pete Rose, never [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=318.86s)]
*  liked him as a player. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=324.09999999999997s)]
*  I was a Braves fan, never liked his attitude, never. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=326.94s)]
*  He was rough. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=329.86s)]
*  To say he was rough around the edges is an understatement. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=330.86s)]
*  He belongs in the Hall of Fame, Mike, doesn't he? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=334.9s)]
*  He was extraordinary, an extraordinary player in every way. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=338.46s)]
*  You know, I was talking with someone yesterday about Pete Rose, and he does have that reputation [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=345.21999999999997s)]
*  and that image is lasting. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=350.14s)]
*  He's an angry guy, practically illiterate, always angry, hard to get along with. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=352.06s)]
*  But I distinctly remember the night after game six of the 1975 World Series, the afternoon [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=357.34s)]
*  after that game, approaching Pete Rose, who was on the field at Fenway working out, it [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=363.5s)]
*  was about three or four hours before game seven, unfortunately Red Sox lost game seven, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=369.26s)]
*  approaching Pete Rose to ask him a question about playing in a game like that. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=374.09999999999997s)]
*  And I was kind of anxious about his, was he going to tell me to screw, whatever? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=378.54s)]
*  And I went up to him and I said, Pete, let me ask you something. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=383.54s)]
*  What do you think, what happens to a player the day after a game that you played like [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=387.5s)]
*  last night? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=391.58000000000004s)]
*  And he paused for a few seconds and looked right at me and said, you know, he said it [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=392.58000000000004s)]
*  was an honor to play in a game like that. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=397.38s)]
*  That was one of the greatest games I've ever participated in. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=399.86s)]
*  And I was shocked. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=403.5s)]
*  Wow, that is— [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=404.78000000000003s)]
*  I mean, that's just great. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=406.66s)]
*  Love of the game right there. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=408.74s)]
*  So Jason, it sounds like you're open to the idea now of voting for Pete Rose. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=409.94s)]
*  I don't want to put you on the spot in this moment unless you want to announce your vote [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=414.9s)]
*  for the Hall of Fame. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=418.18s)]
*  What do you think about the other writers, your colleagues, the guys you've kind of grown [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=420.06s)]
*  up in the business and worked alongside for so long? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=423.78s)]
*  What's their attitude about Pete Rose? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=426.3s)]
*  And do you think this decision by the commissioner changes it? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=428.53999999999996s)]
*  Well, Willie, Pete Rose is never going to appear on the baseball writers' ballot. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=432.06s)]
*  His time, his eligibility for that is over. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=437.38s)]
*  So he will only appear on a ballot, as I said, that's considered by one of these committees. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=440.73999999999995s)]
*  And there will be a lot of living Hall of Famers in the room. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=447.58s)]
*  And my sense is they're divided about this, just as people have been divided about it [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=451.9s)]
*  for three decades. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=459.41999999999996s)]
*  But again, are they willing to look at what Rob Manfred did yesterday and come to the [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=462.98s)]
*  same conclusion that I came to, that if he served his time, we should be thinking about [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=469.34000000000003s)]
*  Pete Rose, the baseball player, and that's that. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FC1_7Oaxgc&t=474.62s)]
