# Drone strike in Tehran, missile fire in Israel: Tensions escalate amid diplomatic talks
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU)
*  We continue to follow the latest out of the Middle East as European ministers meet today [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=0.0s)]
*  in Switzerland with Iranian officials for talks. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=4.24s)]
*  Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff is not present there. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  France has said its foreign minister spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio ahead [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=13.36s)]
*  of the meeting. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  It comes as Israeli media is reporting a drone strike in Tehran today, killing another nuclear [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=19.3s)]
*  scientist. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=26.88s)]
*  Spring in NBC News, international correspondent Matt Bradley live from Israel where air raid [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=28.599999999999998s)]
*  alarms just sounded throughout most of the country. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=33.36s)]
*  Matt, what are you seeing and hearing there? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=36.24s)]
*  Yeah, that's right, Mika. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=39.16s)]
*  So we just had an alarm and from what we understand now, six areas were hit according to Israeli [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=41.36s)]
*  emergency officials. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=47.94s)]
*  One of them was a serious hit and one of them was moderate. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=49.78s)]
*  These were in the north and the center of the country. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=52.5s)]
*  Two people were seriously wounded in Haifa, which is the northern city in Israel. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=54.98s)]
*  But I want to start out by saying that yesterday we reported on the deaths of around 60 people [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=60.699999999999996s)]
*  who were fatally shot while waiting for food in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=65.1s)]
*  We should clarify that those people were waiting for food rations that were arriving from UN [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=69.98s)]
*  convoys, not those that were distributed by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=74.25999999999999s)]
*  But back to what's going on between Israel and Iran, this situation is continuing. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=78.58s)]
*  We had seen something of a reprieve, again for the past several days. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=82.86s)]
*  In fact, there hadn't been a siren here in Tel Aviv for more than the past 24 hours. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=85.98s)]
*  In fact, there hasn't been a death here in all of Israel for many days. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=91.62s)]
*  But the fact is that we're still hearing these sirens with decreasing regularity and we understand [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=96.98s)]
*  that there are fewer missiles in each of these salvos that have been fired by the Iranians. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=102.38s)]
*  And this, the Israelis are saying, is because they're going missile hunting, because of [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=106.62s)]
*  their dominance over the skies, over Tehran and over Western Iran, they're able to basically [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=111.3s)]
*  pick their targets and react to intelligence that they're receiving in real time as the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=116.3s)]
*  fighting continues. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=121.9s)]
*  And the Israelis have said they have mostly been striking, it sounds like, these missile [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=122.9s)]
*  batteries. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=127.34s)]
*  And according to the Israelis, they've now destroyed about 200 of them. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=128.34s)]
*  This is what we heard from them yesterday. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=131.16s)]
*  That's about two thirds of the missile batteries that the Iranians have been using to fire [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=133.06s)]
*  here in Israel. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=136.84s)]
*  Now, whether or not that that's responsible for the decrease in the number of missiles, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=139.06s)]
*  it probably is, because while they're still, the Iranians still do have these ballistic [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=142.78s)]
*  missiles that they've been firing at Israel, they don't necessarily have the number of [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=146.98000000000002s)]
*  launchers that makes it so that they can fill up these salvos with hundreds of missiles, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=151.38s)]
*  which is what we saw last year, the first time that the Israelis and the Iranians exchanged [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=156.26000000000002s)]
*  direct fire. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=160.78s)]
*  But now we're starting to hear that there's diplomacy that's shifted to Europe now, as [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=162.06s)]
*  we all wait for Donald Trump to make a decision on whether the United States should intervene. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=167.38000000000002s)]
*  There's diplomats, leaders from Britain, France and Germany meeting in Geneva with their counterpart [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=172.46s)]
*  from Iran, the foreign minister there. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=178.02s)]
*  Guys? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=180.18s)]
*  All right, NBC's Matt Bradley, live from Israel. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=181.18s)]
*  Thank you very much for that report. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=185.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsvIhIcE1WU&t=197.3s)]
