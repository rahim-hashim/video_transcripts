Sen. Ernst doubled down on her stance over the weekend in a video posted to her social media.

# 'How has she become this?' Joe slams Sen. Ernst's 'bizarre' video on Medicaid cuts
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE)
*  Meanwhile, Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa is defending comments she made at a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=0.0s)]
*  town hall event on Friday. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  Ernst was criticized for her response to constituents who were angry over proposed cuts to Medicaid. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=8.4s)]
*  Despite the backlash, the senator doubled down, posting a sarcastic apology video that [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=16.44s)]
*  appears to be filmed at a cemetery. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=23.16s)]
*  Take a look at her original comment and then what she had to say later. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=27.44s)]
*  So we people are not well, we all are going to die. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=33.72s)]
*  So for heaven's sakes, for heaven's sakes, folks. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=40.32s)]
*  Hello everyone. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=47.32s)]
*  I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely apologize for a statement that I made yesterday [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  at my town hall. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=55.96s)]
*  See I was in the process of answering a question that had been asked by an audience member [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=58.56s)]
*  when a woman who was extremely distraught screamed out from the back corner of the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=63.74s)]
*  auditorium, people are going to die. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=70.36s)]
*  And I made an incorrect assumption that everyone in the auditorium understood that yes, we [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=74.96s)]
*  are all going to perish from this earth. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=86.08s)]
*  So I apologize. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=89.89999999999999s)]
*  And I'm really, really glad that I did not have to bring up the subject of the tooth [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=92.75999999999999s)]
*  fairy as well. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=98.19999999999999s)]
*  But for those that would like to see eternal and everlasting life, I encourage you to embrace [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=101.28s)]
*  my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  Oh, that makes it okay. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=113.44s)]
*  You throw Jesus under the bus. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=117.56s)]
*  You actually mock people that tell you the truth that about 40% of children in your home [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=120.68s)]
*  state depend on Medicaid for their primary health care, that up to 50% of seniors in [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=128.8s)]
*  nursing homes depend on Medicaid and the funding for Medicaid, and you're mocking them and [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=140.12s)]
*  talking about the tooth fairy and voting for a bill that is going to savage rural health [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=149.68s)]
*  care in your home state. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=158.0s)]
*  Rural health care over the past 10 years. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=162.48s)]
*  I talked to anybody in rural health care. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=165.35999999999999s)]
*  They'll tell you this. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=167.2s)]
*  Talk to Republicans running hospitals in Iowa. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=169.0s)]
*  Talk to doctors, Republican doctors who have never voted for a Democrat before in Iowa. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=172.23999999999998s)]
*  Talk to people that run nursing homes in Iowa that have never voted for a Democrat before. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=178.89999999999998s)]
*  Talk to pediatricians in Iowa and rural Iowa who probably never voted for a Democrat before. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=184.79999999999998s)]
*  They'll all tell you that cutting Medicaid is going to have a substantial impact. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=192.44s)]
*  These proposed cuts are going to have a substantial impact on rural health care. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=201.04s)]
*  We had a rural health care specialist on about a month ago. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=206.68s)]
*  Talking about these cuts and Jonathan Lemire, again, I guess this is what Republican politicians [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=213.16s)]
*  in Washington, D.C. do when they get desperate. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=225.8s)]
*  Not sure why they do this because we just out and out told people what we were going [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=230.0s)]
*  to do when we were balancing the budget. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=236.66s)]
*  Did four times in a row. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=239.88s)]
*  Didn't do it without savaging people. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=241.68s)]
*  We did it without savaging people. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=243.48s)]
*  Here though, they're going to vote for tax cuts for Elon Musk, other billionaires, richest [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=245.12s)]
*  people on earth, and they're going to cut Medicaid, which again, for Joni Ernst in rural [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=253.96s)]
*  Iowa actually provides an enormous amount of funding for health care in the state of [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=263.2s)]
*  Iowa and she decides she's going to a cemetery and talking about the tooth fairy and then [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=269.8s)]
*  throw Jesus under the bus at the end. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=276.59999999999997s)]
*  I'm not sure how that squares up with the red letters in the Gospels. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=279.56s)]
*  I'm really not sure how it squares, but I guess she tried to do it, but it's a bizarre [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=282.96s)]
*  video and also especially bizarre when what she was being told by her constituents during [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=289.92s)]
*  that town hall meeting is something that every Republican with rural hospitals, with rural [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=297.04s)]
*  nursing homes, with rural pediatric centers, they know it to be the truth. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=303.88s)]
*  How has she become this? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=311.20000000000005s)]
*  How has she become this type of legislator? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=313.8s)]
*  I'm at a loss. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=317.52000000000004s)]
*  Well, first to your point about the bill itself, it's right. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=319.12s)]
*  This is going to provide tax cuts for the wealthy and it's going to slash services [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=321.76s)]
*  to the poor, including the rural poor. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=325.15999999999997s)]
*  Republicans can try to spin that away. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=327.2s)]
*  They can try to run away from it. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=329.15999999999997s)]
*  It's simply there. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=330.68s)]
*  We heard from Speaker Johnson as well, claiming it's not going to drive up the deficit. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=331.68s)]
*  And of course it is. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=334.64s)]
*  We can do the math. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=336.35999999999996s)]
*  As for that video, what the hell? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=338.28s)]
*  That was some of the strangest politics I've ever seen. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=341.71999999999997s)]
*  It's really weird. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=344.32s)]
*  And what it is, is it's an evolution of just how trumpified the Republican Party has been [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=345.4s)]
*  in terms of his guiding ethos. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=350.44s)]
*  Never apologize. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=352.88s)]
*  You always just go forward. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=354.2s)]
*  You keep pushing. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=355.88s)]
*  You never back down. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=356.88s)]
*  And she tried to do it with these jokes in the cemetery that just landed so poorly. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=358.76s)]
*  It was so tone deaf. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=364.08s)]
*  She got legitimate anger in that town hall. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=366.56s)]
*  She didn't know how to handle it then. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=369.15999999999997s)]
*  She said something that she knew and her team, Shirley knew, was going to be used in a campaign [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=370.48s)]
*  to make a leading ad against her. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=375.12s)]
*  A made-for-TV moment. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=376.44s)]
*  We're all going to die. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=378.44s)]
*  And instead of trying to walk it back, she goes, she pushes forward. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=380.04s)]
*  Let's remember, I think the other important context here is Senator Ernst in particular [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=383.16s)]
*  was the one who was the victim of a pressure campaign from MAGA allies over the confirmation [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=387.64s)]
*  battle for Secretary of Defense Pete Hegsath. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=395.04s)]
*  She was seen as sort of the swing vote that might submarine his bid to run the Pentagon. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=397.26s)]
*  She was threatened with a primary from the right. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=402.56s)]
*  She didn't want to face that. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=405.98s)]
*  She changed her vote. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=407.64s)]
*  She came around. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=408.8s)]
*  She voted for Hegsath. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=409.8s)]
*  But it's very clear that she's still dealing with that and is gun shy of trying to do anything [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=410.8s)]
*  to cross what she believes the president wants because she's afraid she might be in a battle [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=417.36s)]
*  internally to hang on to her seat. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=422.02s)]
*  By the way, the question is not whether we're all going to die or not. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=425.0s)]
*  The question is whether you're going to give tax cuts to billionaires and take food out [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=427.16s)]
*  of the mouths of the poorest Americans and also take hospital services away from the [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=431.36s)]
*  poorest in your own state, which is what Joni Ernst is doing with this vote. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=435.82000000000005s)]
*  And then she's trying to explain it away by talking about tooth fairies in a cemetery. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=441.68s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=445.68s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=446.68s)]
*  I get a situation. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=447.68s)]
*  I'm not David Ignatius. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=448.68s)]
*  I'm not I'm not wishing for the good old days. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=450.16s)]
*  You know, 30 years ago when I was in Congress, 20 years ago, I wouldn't call those the good [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=454.52000000000004s)]
*  old days. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=460.58s)]
*  We had really tough fights, but it's unimaginable that a United States senator on either side [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=461.58s)]
*  would behave in this way. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=469.82s)]
*  I just can't even imagine it. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=471.53999999999996s)]
*  I mean, you know, they weren't so scared of presidents that they would they would mock [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=473.18s)]
*  their own constituents, especially again, you look at Iowa and I'm not asking you to [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=478.46s)]
*  get into the politics of this, but the rural health care that's going to be savaged by [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=484.34s)]
*  this bill. But I'm just talking about how senators comport themselves and trying to [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=489.62s)]
*  make jokes about people suffering. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=494.98s)]
*  So Joni Ernst was was tone deaf. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=498.54s)]
*  And it's rare to have such an outrageous comment, even even with our legislature. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=501.5s)]
*  But Joe, I think this is a preview of what's ahead. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=509.26s)]
*  This tax spending bill, when you pare everything away, is about giving more to the rich and [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=514.14s)]
*  about cutting programs for the poor, as was said earlier. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=522.5s)]
*  And Republicans are going to have to defend that all over the country. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=525.9s)]
*  We've seen in recent weeks that when they go home to their districts, they're met with [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=529.78s)]
*  often angry groups of constituents who say, what the heck is going on in Washington? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=534.22s)]
*  This isn't what we voted for. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=540.4399999999999s)]
*  We didn't vote to see programs slashed. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=541.98s)]
*  We didn't vote to see benefits for Elon Musk and his friends. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=544.66s)]
*  So I think this is a little snapshot that tells you what we're going to see more and [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=548.34s)]
*  more of as we moved through this year, through this bill in the next year's midterm campaigns. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=553.62s)]
*  This isn't going away. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=562.34s)]
*  Yeah. And Mike, again, just just dating myself and proving how old I am. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=564.34s)]
*  I remember Trent Lott and Tom Daschle would beat the hell out of each other on Meet the Press. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=569.7s)]
*  Be there with them. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=577.7s)]
*  They'd go, you know, they would savagely each other. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=578.7s)]
*  And then afterwards, they'd pick up the phone, they'd call to talk to each other. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=581.3000000000001s)]
*  Never do outrageous things like this. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=585.6600000000001s)]
*  I mean, it just it didn't happen. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=587.4200000000001s)]
*  There was a way to disagree on spending bills. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=589.94s)]
*  There was a way to disagree on other things. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=592.74s)]
*  And again, figure out how to do what was best for the country. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=596.18s)]
*  We saw it with Bill Clinton and a Congress that he had little use for. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=602.1s)]
*  We balanced the budget four years in a row. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=607.26s)]
*  We saw it with Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan, who would work together and talk to each other [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=608.98s)]
*  time and time again throughout the 1980s, even though they disagreed greatly with each [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=616.54s)]
*  other. But here, going to a cemetery to mock your constituents and talk about the tooth fairy [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=623.82s)]
*  again is so beyond the pale. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=632.94s)]
*  I'll tell you, if you had done that 20, 25 years ago, I don't know that senators will be talking [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=635.94s)]
*  to you in the cloakroom like on Monday morning. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=643.74s)]
*  They'll be turning their back, embarrassed of you, embarrassed to be associated with you. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=646.58s)]
*  This is just talk about just a childish behavior for a United States senator who is mocking her [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=651.58s)]
*  constituents, who are worried about their health care, their children's health care and their [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=660.4200000000001s)]
*  grandparents, our parents' health care. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=666.4200000000001s)]
*  She did it because she's afraid of one person, Joe, Donald Trump. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=669.94s)]
*  That's why she did it. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=674.1s)]
*  That's her poor judgment in doing it. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=676.22s)]
*  Clearly, no one could talk her out of doing it because she did it because her fear of losing [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=678.7800000000001s)]
*  her Senate seat and her fear of the president of the United States. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=683.4200000000001s)]
*  You used a phrase a couple of minutes ago that used to be used a lot, I think, 10, 15, 20 years [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=686.6600000000001s)]
*  ago in both the House and the Senate. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=693.4200000000001s)]
*  And the phrase is, what's best for the country? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=695.34s)]
*  I don't know that that phrase is used a lot these days in Washington, D.C. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=699.14s)]
*  What's best for the country? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=702.94s)]
*  From the beginning, this bill that we're talking about right now, the big, beautiful bill, an [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=704.5799999999999s)]
*  absurd title for stripping poor people of the meager things that they might have now, stripping [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=710.3s)]
*  more of the rights and the benefits that people need to survive, stripping people of the right to [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=718.3399999999999s)]
*  have Medicaid, Medicaid fund their whatever they're looking for when they find a Medicaid office [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=723.7399999999999s)]
*  that's open or a program that they can be accepted into, stripping all of that from the least [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=730.14s)]
*  among us in order to reward those with the most among us. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=736.66s)]
*  It is absurd. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=740.82s)]
*  It's obscene. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=742.0600000000001s)]
*  And it's a terrible indictment of the United States of America Congress, the way the politicians [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=743.3000000000001s)]
*  act every single day, seemingly not all of them, but most of them. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=748.78s)]
*  The big, beautiful bill. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=752.78s)]
*  Please, God, help us. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=754.9s)]
*  And while doing all of that, adding 20 trillion dollars to a thirty seven trillion dollar [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=757.78s)]
*  national debt, it's unsustainable. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=767.5s)]
*  It's unsustainable. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=772.14s)]
*  I've been talking about this for 20 years when Democrats are in office, when Republicans, it is [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=773.5799999999999s)]
*  this is unsustainable. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=777.86s)]
*  And all the lying in the world doesn't make that go away. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=780.74s)]
*  All of the lying in the world right now from Mike Johnson and other Republicans saying it [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=784.1800000000001s)]
*  doesn't add to that, all the lying in the world will not save all Americans. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=789.74s)]
*  When a day of reckoning comes on this debt and it is coming, if this bill passes, it is coming. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=797.0600000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G86n875stE&t=803.78s)]
