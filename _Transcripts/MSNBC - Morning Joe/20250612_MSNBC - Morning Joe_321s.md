# Trump is under water on key issues and majority of voters oppose GOP megabill: Poll
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs)
*  Let's turn now to that new polling. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=0.0s)]
*  It's from Quinnipiac University. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=1.96s)]
*  And it shows that 38% of voters approve of the way Donald Trump is handling his job as [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=3.92s)]
*  president. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=8.36s)]
*  That's lower than other recent polling. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=9.52s)]
*  To underscore, just 38% approve, while 54% disapprove of his performance in the White [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=11.52s)]
*  House. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=17.56s)]
*  The president is also underwater on some of his top issues, including immigration. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=18.56s)]
*  On that issue, Trump's approval rating has dropped down to 43%. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=23.580000000000002s)]
*  Trump is also upside down on questions of deportations, on the economy, trade, his handling [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=27.88s)]
*  of the nation's universities, as well as the conflicts in both Gaza and Ukraine. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=33.8s)]
*  A majority of the voters also had objections to his signature piece of legislation, which [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=39.76s)]
*  of course he has deemed the big, beautiful bill. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=44.64s)]
*  53% of those polled do not support the legislation. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=47.84s)]
*  27% do support it, and another 20% offered no opinion. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=51.84s)]
*  So Mike Barnacle, some other polls that have him a little higher than this. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=57.16s)]
*  This is the lowest we've seen. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=61.08s)]
*  But although the trends are there, his approval rating has declined, especially in the last [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=62.68s)]
*  week or so. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=67.64s)]
*  And let's just start with the idea of on his signature issue. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=69.14s)]
*  Because we heard from Sam a moment ago, he's right, immigration was perhaps one of his [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=71.67999999999999s)]
*  key campaign promises. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=75.64s)]
*  He said, I'm going to do this. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=77.25999999999999s)]
*  Perhaps Americans, though, didn't anticipate the presence of American soldiers on American [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=79.72s)]
*  As well as some of the other in your face tactics. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=86.11999999999999s)]
*  What do you see in these numbers? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=89.11999999999999s)]
*  I see the same thing in these numbers as I see on television. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=91.19999999999999s)]
*  This is such a visual nation. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  And it begins with the spark of a flame in Los Angeles. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=97.44s)]
*  And it occurs in a street that's maybe less than a mile long. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=101.8s)]
*  And yet within six hours, because of what we see on TV, it explodes into this myth that [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=105.84s)]
*  Los Angeles is under siege, that Los Angeles, according to Kristi Noem, is filled with bad [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=111.68s)]
*  people, that there are riots throughout Los Angeles when that was just not the case. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=116.76s)]
*  And so now we're into the contagion factor, Jonathan. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=122.68s)]
*  With regard to the president's popularity on this, again, we go back to the visual. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=125.72000000000001s)]
*  People see on their home screens watching the news, they see men jumping out of SUVs, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=130.60000000000002s)]
*  wearing masks, grabbing American citizens off the street. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=136.88s)]
*  And within 24 hours, that citizen, he or she, might end up in Texas at some prison or in [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  Arkansas at some prison, whether they're taken off the streets in New York or Boston or Somerville, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  Massachusetts, where that happened to a young woman. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=152.92s)]
*  So you've got all of that going on at the same time. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=155.88s)]
*  This portends to be a long, hot summer. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  The contagion factor has now set in, as we were just reporting, from city to city to [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=164.32s)]
*  city. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=169.56s)]
*  People are out. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=170.84s)]
*  And sometimes the local police departments aren't up to handling it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=171.88s)]
*  The Los Angeles police department made one initial mistake. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=175.2s)]
*  They waited too long on that first day to tell the demonstrators, we have the power [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=178.4s)]
*  of arrest. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=183.72s)]
*  These are handcuffs. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=184.79999999999998s)]
*  You take one step forward, you raise any prospect of violence against us, you're going to jail. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=186.24s)]
*  They just waited a little too long. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=191.95999999999998s)]
*  They're doing fine now. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=193.4s)]
*  But this is a troubled country with a troubled issue. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=195.04s)]
*  Yeah, and a lot of eyes will be on the protests this weekend. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=197.6s)]
*  Numerous planned. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=200.28s)]
*  And Ali Battali, the Trump administration, basically has made two big bets, right? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=201.28s)]
*  One's on immigration. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=204.4s)]
*  Just talked about that. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=205.4s)]
*  The other is this signature piece of legislation, where it's the entire Trump-Republican agenda [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=206.44s)]
*  in one package. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=212.56s)]
*  And this poll suggests Americans don't really like what they're seeing. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=214.28s)]
*  Yet they're reportedly, the Trump administration, trying to sell this on Capitol Hill as popular [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=219.6s)]
*  in various ways. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=224.64s)]
*  For example, telling lawmakers that not letting tax cuts lapse, basically saying that they're [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=225.88s)]
*  cutting taxes even though they're just preserving what's already there, is popular with the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=231.72s)]
*  American people. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=235.44s)]
*  So they're trying to make that political sell to lawmakers who, with the passage of time, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=236.44s)]
*  might be getting more and more uncomfortable with this bill. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=240.44s)]
*  But I also think it's important to lay out the landscape and kind of build upon what [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=243.42s)]
*  Mike Barnicle was just saying, that this idea of protests spreading throughout the country [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=247.51999999999998s)]
*  and the backdrop of just this last week alone, the White House starting the week by leveraging [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=252.07999999999998s)]
*  these National Guard troops in Los Angeles against the objections of key state leaders [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=257.24s)]
*  there, then following through to the entirety of the week that will culminate on Saturday [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=262.44s)]
*  with this military parade that most Republican senators say they're not going to be able [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=266.32s)]
*  to go to for scheduling issues or because they have concerns about the cost. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=270.76s)]
*  All of it is meant to leverage the military might of this country, put it on display, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=275.44s)]
*  and show that Trump is atop of it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=280.44s)]
*  It's clearly an optics feature that he is very keen on, the White House keen to say [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=282.47999999999996s)]
*  that it's an outgrowth of their immigration mandate, and yet most of the sources that [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=286.88s)]
*  I talk to who are concerned about this optic say that the more that it gets into a military [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=290.59999999999997s)]
*  space and the less it gets in an immigration space, that's where the scales could potentially [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=295.52s)]
*  tip. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH96ZlZ1MQs&t=300.32s)]
