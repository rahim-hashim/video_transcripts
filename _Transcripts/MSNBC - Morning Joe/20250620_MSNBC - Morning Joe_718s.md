Video Description: Bridgewater founder and bestselling author Ray Dalio joins Morning Joe to discuss his new book, "How Countries Go Broke: The Big Cycle," and why rising U.S. debt is putting the post-WWII global order at risk. Dalio warns that unless the U.S. curbs spending and raises revenue, debt service costs will crowd out government spending, pushing the economy into crisis.

# 'We’re headed toward the rocks': Ray Dalio warns U.S. debt is reaching the point of no return
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY)
*  According to a new analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, President Trump's budget could [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=0.0s)]
*  increase federal deficit spending as much as $3.3 trillion over the next 10 years. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=4.72s)]
*  That figure is causing friction on capital, with members of both parties sounding the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=10.84s)]
*  political alarm on America's rising national debt, which now sits at approximately $36 [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=14.620000000000001s)]
*  trillion. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=20.16s)]
*  And rising with us now, New York Times bestselling author and founder of the Bridgewater Associates [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=21.16s)]
*  hedge fund Ray Dalio. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=27.22s)]
*  He's the author of the new book titled How Countries Go Broke, The Big Cycle, which [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=28.7s)]
*  looks at how mounting debt for other major forces are putting current geopolitical order [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=33.18s)]
*  in jeopardy. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=40.66s)]
*  And Mr. Dalio, that's a political order really that's been in place since the end of World [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=41.66s)]
*  War II, and debt could be undermining that. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  Explain to us how. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=50.739999999999995s)]
*  The reason I wrote the book is that for about 50 years I've been in the markets betting [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=53.14s)]
*  on these things, and I wanted to convey the mechanics of how the process works. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=59.3s)]
*  So think about it this way. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=66.12s)]
*  The credit system is like the circulatory system, and that it brings buying power throughout [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=68.72s)]
*  and by creating credit you create buying power and that creates debt. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=77.22s)]
*  But if that debt produces income, then that's a healthy system. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=83.14s)]
*  If it doesn't, it produces interest rates and debt service that build up and crowd out [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=87.58s)]
*  spending. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=94.86s)]
*  And so we can see that happening to the government. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=96.16s)]
*  So now interest rates, for example, relate are now $1 trillion. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  So let me put the budget in perspective. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=105.92s)]
*  That number that you gave is a wrong number because it is the amount of deficit on top [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=108.88s)]
*  of the amount of deficit that would be there. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=116.18s)]
*  $7 trillion is the amount the government spends every year. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=119.8s)]
*  It takes in $5 trillion. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=125.04s)]
*  As a result, it's got a $2 trillion deficit. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=128.06s)]
*  It works the same for governments as it works for individuals or companies, except the government [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=132.5s)]
*  can print money. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=138.38s)]
*  And so that is building up. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=139.9s)]
*  Over the next 10 years, it's going to increase by the debt, and the debt service is going [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=141.5s)]
*  to increase by more than 10 times that $2.5 trillion number because that number was a [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=147.98000000000002s)]
*  number on top of the deficit. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=156.38s)]
*  So what we're having is a crowding out, like in plaque building up in the system, a crowding [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=158.86s)]
*  out of spending. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=166.02s)]
*  And that amount of debt now is about $230,000 per person. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=168.96s)]
*  So you can see it happen in that way. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=174.26000000000002s)]
*  In addition, you have supply-demand issues. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=176.26000000000002s)]
*  In other words, one man's debts are another man's assets. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=179.86s)]
*  And when there is a lot of more debt that's being sold, then you have a demand problem, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=183.94s)]
*  not an adequate amount of demand. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=190.5s)]
*  We're seeing this happen now as central banks and foreign investors are buying less and, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=192.46s)]
*  in fact, shifting to gold. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=198.38s)]
*  So there's that dynamic that I'm trying to convey the mechanics of. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=200.4s)]
*  It's not political, and there's something we can do about that, what I call the three-part, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=205.34s)]
*  3% solution. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=210.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=212.01999999999998s)]
*  And just to give our friends who are watching right now just a bit of perspective, when [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=213.01999999999998s)]
*  I left Congress, we had balanced budgets, we had surpluses in the way of a $5 trillion [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=219.98s)]
*  debt. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=226.01999999999998s)]
*  And just to show this is not, as you said, this is not a partisan issue, then a Republican [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=227.01999999999998s)]
*  president came in, the debt doubled to $10 trillion. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=233.01999999999998s)]
*  Then a Democratic president came in, the debt doubled again to about $20 trillion. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=235.66s)]
*  Donald Trump came in, the debt exploded. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=239.98s)]
*  Joe Biden came in, the debt exploded. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=242.74s)]
*  Both parties over the past 25 years have been extraordinarily reckless. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=245.5s)]
*  We're now talking about adding another $20 trillion in the next decade. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=251.54s)]
*  Could you explain to us in writing how countries go broke, how that could happen to the United [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=255.28s)]
*  States? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=261.9s)]
*  If we go from having a $37 trillion debt to a $57 trillion debt in a decade, that's not [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=262.9s)]
*  sustainable, is it? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=268.54s)]
*  No. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=269.86s)]
*  And you could see it. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=270.86s)]
*  OK, if you understand the mechanics, you can actually see it. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=272.3s)]
*  So you could see that this debt service has now crowding out spending. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=277.3s)]
*  So you can see you can't cut spending very much. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=286.5s)]
*  It's fixed. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=289.22s)]
*  And that the interest continues to build up that way. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=290.38s)]
*  And like plaque, so if I was a doctor looking at your circumstances, I could show you that [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=293.74s)]
*  building up and I could show you that crowding out. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=299.74s)]
*  You can also see the supply relative to the demand, and you could see the big imbalance. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=302.58s)]
*  And then there's the big risk that not only is the supply of new supply a problem, but [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=310.26s)]
*  also those who are holding the bonds may not think they're going to get a good real return. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=317.34000000000003s)]
*  And if you study history and you see this, you would not want to hold those bonds expecting [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=325.04s)]
*  a good real return. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=330.56s)]
*  And you could see selling. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=332.08000000000004s)]
*  And so that dynamic is you can see it mechanically. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=333.90000000000003s)]
*  And you could also see that we are at the point in that cycle that the adding that debt [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=338.20000000000005s)]
*  from just this next year and the next two years will put us over the edge, could put [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=345.28000000000003s)]
*  us over the edge very close to that, because you're now having the need to create debt [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=351.47999999999996s)]
*  in order to pay the debt. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=359.12s)]
*  And so when you see these debt cycles, there are something like 50 of them looked at in [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=361.08s)]
*  this book. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=367.12s)]
*  When you get that the debt is having to pay the debt, then what happens? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=369.56s)]
*  You have the government come in and the central bank and you have printing money. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=373.76s)]
*  You're entirely right. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=378.59999999999997s)]
*  From 1991 until 1998, they reduced the federal debt by 5% of GDP. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=380.38s)]
*  We could cut the federal debt right now if it's done in a certain way, three ways. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=389.65999999999997s)]
*  You can cut that down to 3% of GDP. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=396.9s)]
*  You need a 3% of GDP. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=401.14s)]
*  It's now going to be about 7% of GDP. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=403.62s)]
*  If you can cut that by down to 3% of GDP, then you change the supply demand and you [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=406.86s)]
*  don't have that compounding effect. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=414.3s)]
*  And there are three ways to do that, and they have to be balanced. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=417.42s)]
*  The three ways are, of course, in spending and tax revenue, I'll emphasize revenue, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=421.5s)]
*  and also then interest rates, because interest is such a big component of the debt. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=429.42s)]
*  If there's lower interest rates, but you can't force those interest rates down because [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=435.34s)]
*  bondholders won't want to hold it if they get a poor interest rate, but you have a situation [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=439.78s)]
*  where if you change the supply and demand, you will naturally have a lower interest rate. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=445.78s)]
*  So we're at that point now. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=450.58s)]
*  And Gene Robinson, you don't wave a magic wand or bully a Fed chief and say lower the [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=454.46s)]
*  interest rates because then the bondholders flee. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=460.15999999999997s)]
*  It reminds us all, and I know you remember this, early in Bill Clinton's term, as we [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=463.22s)]
*  were about to undergo a decade of deficit reduction, he was told by Alan Greenspan, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=471.5s)]
*  you're not going to be able to allow the deficit to explode. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=478.3s)]
*  You're going to have people, bond traders, that are going to rebel and revolt against [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=482.46s)]
*  you and interest rates are going to up and it's going to be a terrible cycle. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=488.22s)]
*  Bill Clinton said, you mean my whole damn presidency is going to be held hostage by [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=491.78s)]
*  bond traders? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=495.53999999999996s)]
*  And Alan Greenspan basically said, yes, it is. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=496.53999999999996s)]
*  Here we are again in 2025. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=500.85999999999996s)]
*  Well, that's obviously the interest rates are important. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=503.73999999999995s)]
*  And discretionary spending, though, is relatively small compared to entitlement spending. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=510.26s)]
*  And I wonder, Ray, if it is indeed possible in your view to get to your 3% without cutting [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=519.94s)]
*  Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, which I personally would have problems with. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=534.94s)]
*  But politically, that is essentially a non-starter. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=545.82s)]
*  So can you leave those programs alone and get to your 3%? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=550.5s)]
*  The way I do the numbers, I find if you could take it about a 4% cut in spending and a 4% [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=555.9000000000001s)]
*  improvement in tax revenue, that you would get enough of a decrease in the deficit that [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=566.98s)]
*  you would also naturally have about 100 basis points, maybe more, decrease in interest rates [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=575.98s)]
*  and you'd get very close to that, that you have to, so you have to bring it in that order [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=583.26s)]
*  of magnitude. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=589.42s)]
*  I'm not saying that that's easy, but it's a political question. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=590.9s)]
*  When I go to Washington and I speak to people on both sides, everybody agrees with what [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=594.98s)]
*  I'm saying, meaning that you have to get it to 3% of GDP and so on. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=600.58s)]
*  But it's political because it's like being on a boat headed to rocks. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=607.82s)]
*  And on the boat, everybody agrees you have to turn. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=613.82s)]
*  And they can't agree whether you turn left or you turn right, and they're going to go [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=617.12s)]
*  right into the rocks. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=620.7800000000001s)]
*  And so it's a political question. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=622.62s)]
*  I think the period from 1991 to 1998 that also Joe is referring to is a good model period [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=625.7s)]
*  to take a look of how to best do it and realize that the consequences of not doing it are [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=633.7s)]
*  disastrous. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=639.74s)]
*  And I will say, before I got to Washington in 1994, we were told it was impossible to [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=643.6600000000001s)]
*  do. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=651.46s)]
*  I'll give you one article after another article saying you couldn't balance the budget. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=653.1s)]
*  Now you can't do it overnight, but we have to move in that direction because we are going [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=656.82s)]
*  toward the rocks, as he said. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=661.1800000000001s)]
*  And the question is not whether we do it, it's how we're going to do it. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=663.22s)]
*  We have to do it. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=667.5400000000001s)]
*  And now. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=668.5400000000001s)]
*  There is no other choice. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=669.5400000000001s)]
*  In this book, this should be must reading for every member of Congress, everybody in [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=670.5400000000001s)]
*  the administration, everybody who wants to understand how important this issue is. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=676.14s)]
*  The new book, How Countries Go Broke, the big cycle is available now. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=680.38s)]
*  Bestselling author and investor Ray Dalio. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=685.18s)]
*  Thank you very much for coming on the show this morning. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=688.06s)]
*  Ray, thank you so much. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=690.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur5zvooRewY&t=710.38s)]
