# REAL ID flight requirements begin: Here's what you need to know
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU)
*  This morning, the Trump administration is acknowledging there is no quick fix when it [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=0.0s)]
*  comes to the ongoing situation at New Jersey's Newark Airport. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=6.32s)]
*  For nearly two weeks, passengers there have faced lengthy delays and cancellations due [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=11.24s)]
*  to serious staffing issues with air traffic controllers. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=16.38s)]
*  And NBC News is exclusively reporting the air traffic controllers at Newark Airport [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=21.04s)]
*  lost contact with pilots at least twice before this latest incident that we're reporting on. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=27.22s)]
*  Joining us live from Newark Airport, NBC News senior correspondent Tom Costello has been [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=34.22s)]
*  breaking a lot of this. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=38.86s)]
*  Tom, what is the latest? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=40.18s)]
*  Well, let's start with real ID because that's also a headline this morning. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=42.18s)]
*  We got a lot of aviation headlines, right? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=46.82s)]
*  Today is the day. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=48.66s)]
*  You will need a real ID if you try to check on into your flight. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=50.06s)]
*  If you don't have a real ID, you can have a passport, military ID, green card. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=54.28s)]
*  I've checked with TSA checkpoints nationwide and so far things are moving pretty well. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  They don't expect any major hangups. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=63.92s)]
*  But here at Newark, as you said, the pressure very much is on the flow of traffic into Newark [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=66.06s)]
*  Airport because of the staffing issues. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=72.76s)]
*  And one current and veteran controller tells me that the situation we had last week when [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=75.72s)]
*  they lost radios and radars all at once, that's happened before. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=81.08000000000001s)]
*  Two weeks and Newark Airport is still struggling. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=87.04s)]
*  This is like three extra layers of stress. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=89.84s)]
*  The problem, a shortage of air traffic controllers and equipment failures. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  Just got told that the approach lost all the radars. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=96.72s)]
*  Three of the four radar screens went black. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=99.80000000000001s)]
*  A current veteran Newark airspace controller tells NBC News that a temporary blackout of [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=101.52000000000001s)]
*  both radio and radar systems from last week has happened at least two other times since [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=107.04s)]
*  last August and that radios alone have gone down as many as nine times. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=112.04s)]
*  That controller says, quote, we lost all radios, no backups. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=117.44000000000001s)]
*  Everything went down, adding they fear if it happens again, people could lose their [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=121.28s)]
*  lives. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=125.68s)]
*  The question is, can I do something more quickly to train controllers? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=126.68s)]
*  And the answer is no. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  This all takes time. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  Compounding Newark's controller shortage, one of the airport's roomways is closed for construction [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=131.8s)]
*  and is not expected to reopen until mid-June. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=136.32s)]
*  The DOT said to unveil plans to overhaul a decades-old ATC system nationwide, but it [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=139.88s)]
*  will take time. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=146.12s)]
*  Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is prioritizing a Newark fix. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=148.04s)]
*  I'm not going to put speed over safety. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=152.04s)]
*  It's going to be as fast as we can and as safe as we can. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=154.68s)]
*  On Tuesday, arrivals at Newark averaged delays of four hours or more. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=158.16s)]
*  I got a text saying my flight would be delayed. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=162.48s)]
*  I think it was about three different times. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=166.0s)]
*  And it all comes as the Real ID requirement is now in place for travelers nationwide. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=168.0s)]
*  That golden star is key. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=173.36s)]
*  The TSA says 81% of current air travelers already have an acceptable form of ID, including [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=174.88s)]
*  a passport. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=181.52s)]
*  But the last-minute scramble to get a Real ID has led to long lines and scarce appointments [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=182.94s)]
*  at DMVs nationwide. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=188.32s)]
*  If people don't have a Real ID, are they going to be denied access to their flight? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=190.6s)]
*  The answer is no. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=195.12s)]
*  They're not going to be denied access to their flight. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=196.12s)]
*  They could be subject to some additional screening. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=198.28s)]
*  Okay, back here at Newark Airport, let me just tell you that United and JetBlue are [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=201.16s)]
*  waiving change fees if you're concerned about your flight coming in or out of here. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=206.44s)]
*  And as you know, United has canceled permanently 35 round trips in and out of Newark Airport. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=211.6s)]
*  I want to make this point. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=217.28s)]
*  You know, a lot of people are saying, why don't they just surge air traffic controllers [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=218.8s)]
*  into Newark, right? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=221.96s)]
*  Some from the West Coast maybe or the Midwest. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=223.60000000000002s)]
*  It's not that simple. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=226.04000000000002s)]
*  Here's why. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=227.04000000000002s)]
*  You have to be certified as a controller for every airspace or tower that you're in. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=228.04000000000002s)]
*  And that certification can take up to a year and a half. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=233.72000000000003s)]
*  And in some cases, if you're, for example, a controller in Seattle and you want to come [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=236.68s)]
*  to Newark, you got to maybe go through the Academy to get certified for this tower or [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=240.92000000000002s)]
*  for this TRACON. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=246.16000000000003s)]
*  So, as a result, it is not a quick fix. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=247.16000000000003s)]
*  That is why the FAA is focusing on slowing the volume of flights because they can't surge [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=249.6s)]
*  controllers in here. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=255.23999999999998s)]
*  Nika? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=256.48s)]
*  That makes sense because each airspace is different. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=257.48s)]
*  Still don't understand why they don't bring in some retirees. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=260.71999999999997s)]
*  But you know, my bigger question is... [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=263.64s)]
*  Mandatory retirement age of 56. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=266.44s)]
*  I know. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=269.03999999999996s)]
*  Why don't they bring back some 57, 58, 59-year-olds? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=270.03999999999996s)]
*  No? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=274.03999999999996s)]
*  No. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=275.03999999999996s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=276.03999999999996s)]
*  So, but my bigger question is back to the real ID issue. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=277.6s)]
*  What do people need to know? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=283.20000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=284.20000000000005s)]
*  Bottom line here is, listen, there are some states that are simply not ready. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=285.20000000000005s)]
*  New Jersey, for example, only 17% of the driver's licenses right now are real ID compliant. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=291.76000000000005s)]
*  California has a low rate of compliance as well. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=298.52000000000004s)]
*  A lot of the country simply isn't ready. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=300.96000000000004s)]
*  So if you don't have a real ID and it's taking forever to get an appointment at the DMV, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=303.52s)]
*  you can use a passport if you have one or a military ID or a green card. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=309.08s)]
*  But the TSA acknowledges, yeah, a lot of the country, despite 20 years since they passed [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=314.88s)]
*  the law, a lot of the country isn't ready. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=320.47999999999996s)]
*  So the TSA is saying, okay, bring something else to verify your identity. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=322.64s)]
*  Could be a mortgage statement, could be a utility bill, whatever. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=327.08s)]
*  But they're really not interested in keeping you from traveling. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=330.8s)]
*  They really don't want to stop you from traveling. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=334.96s)]
*  So unless you really start hitting some flags when you show up without a real ID, chances [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=337.59999999999997s)]
*  are you're going to be able to travel. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=343.12s)]
*  And I asked TSA repeatedly, are you going to ruin family vacations this summer because [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=345.12s)]
*  mom and dad can't get the DMV driver's license appointment and can't get a real ID? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=350.15999999999997s)]
*  And the answer is no. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=355.28s)]
*  We have zero interest in doing that. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=356.52s)]
*  They really don't want to gum up the system. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=358.52s)]
*  This is, I think, turning into a slower rollout, right? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=360.96s)]
*  Slower enforcement. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=364.59999999999997s)]
*  If you got a real ID, great. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=366.08s)]
*  If you don't, bring something else with you to prove who you are. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=367.71999999999997s)]
*  Chances are you're still going to make the flight. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=371.24s)]
*  Okay, NBC News senior correspondent Tom Costello live from Newark Airport, where there is a [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=373.03999999999996s)]
*  lot going on. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=379.44s)]
*  Thank you very much for your reporting this morning. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGhmyZ9spU&t=380.71999999999997s)]
