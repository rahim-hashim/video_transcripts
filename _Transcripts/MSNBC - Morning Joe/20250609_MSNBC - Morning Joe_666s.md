# 'They want this fight': How the White House views Los Angeles protests
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE)
*  Jonathan Lemare, Pablo Torre and Jim Van De Hei are still with us and joining the conversation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=0.0s)]
*  We have NBC News national affairs analyst and a partner and chief political columnist [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  at PUC, John Hellman, and politics bureau chief and senior political columnist for Politico. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=9.64s)]
*  Jonathan Martin is here with us along with NBC News investigative reporter Andrew Blankstein, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=16.36s)]
*  who's live in Los Angeles. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=22.6s)]
*  And Andrew, I'll start with you. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=24.12s)]
*  I want to get a sense of the state of the police in Los Angeles in terms of staffing [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=26.16s)]
*  and resources. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=32.08s)]
*  And also you're looking specifically at how Trump administration officials are posting [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=33.8s)]
*  about all of this. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=39.16s)]
*  Tell us what you found. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=40.44s)]
*  Well, Mika, as you said, I mean, when we talk about the Los Angeles Police Department and [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=41.92s)]
*  resources, we're, there's truly a thin blue line. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=47.84s)]
*  One of the things during the 1990s, the goal was to reach 10,000 officers, which under [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=54.08s)]
*  Chief Charlie Beck, they reached in 2014. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  Since then, and post George Floyd protests here in Los Angeles, it's gone down to about [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=64.6s)]
*  8,700 officers. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=69.8s)]
*  And if you take into account, this is a city of four million people spread out over 500 [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=72.03999999999999s)]
*  square miles. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=77.92s)]
*  And just the things that police have to do every day to respond to a million plus calls [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=78.92s)]
*  every year for calls for service. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=83.92s)]
*  You start to think about the scope of what police have to do deal with every day. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=87.2s)]
*  Then you take into account events like what we've seen escalate the last three days. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=91.8s)]
*  And we've gone from hundreds of people, from dozens to hundreds to thousands of people [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=96.60000000000001s)]
*  showing up. And as some of the pictures have shown, getting into pitch battles with the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=102.36s)]
*  police on the streets. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=108.32000000000001s)]
*  One of my sources said last night it was a long day and an even longer night. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=109.64s)]
*  And some of that video obviously is going to be emerging. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=114.68s)]
*  But this shows no signs of letting up. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=117.68s)]
*  We have more protests scheduled for today. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=120.72s)]
*  We have a sense that, you know, where does this end and how how many more people are [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=123.76s)]
*  going to be drawn in given the fear and the anger from these ICE operations? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=128.8s)]
*  And again, caught in the middle are the LAPD and the sheriff's department. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=135.0s)]
*  And while they welcome some of the rhetoric in terms of support for people that engage [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=138.88s)]
*  in activity that targets law enforcement, they are also concerned about some of the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=144.4s)]
*  rhetoric between public officials kind of that has taken place on on social media. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=151.2s)]
*  Well, specifically, Pam Bondi, the FBI director, the Pete Hegseth, DOD, the vice [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=159.68s)]
*  president and the president, a lot of them focusing specifically either on Los Angeles [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=167.56s)]
*  or on the governor. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=173.04s)]
*  Yes, Mika. And the thing is, when you look at compared to other big incidents here in [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=176.64000000000001s)]
*  Los Angeles, I'm thinking I was here for the Rodney King riots. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=182.8s)]
*  I was here for the George Floyd protests. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=186.12s)]
*  And when you consider that this wasn't really an element before where you would have [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=189.2s)]
*  agencies and individuals commenting and also in in interviews commenting directly critical [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=195.08s)]
*  of public officials, the question mark becomes when you need kind of a united front, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=202.76s)]
*  why is this happening? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=210.88s)]
*  And I think people are asking that tonight. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=212.24s)]
*  Yeah, NBC News investigative reporter Andrew Blankstein, thank you very much, Jamart. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=215.6s)]
*  Let's jump right to the political angle on this. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=220.88s)]
*  Because obviously violence and assaulting or going after police in any way is not welcome [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=225.56s)]
*  here at all and certainly would not help the the Democrats in any way, because it will [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=234.8s)]
*  just it will be the president turning the tables again. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=242.44s)]
*  At the same time, it's it's tense in Los Angeles. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=247.4s)]
*  It's extremely tense because it almost some would say and there is reporting and analysis [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=251.36s)]
*  that says that there's almost a goading that's going on here in a city that has a thin [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=257.04s)]
*  line, as Andrew pointed out, has staffing issues and is stretched to the limit. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=266.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, there's a reason why Trump and his lieutenants are amping this up on TV and social [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=272.2s)]
*  media because they want this fight. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=278.16s)]
*  If this immigration story is about taking kids on the way to high school or day laborers [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=280.32s)]
*  in front of a Home Depot who are trying to make a buck, then this is not a great story [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=286.91999999999996s)]
*  for the folks who are doing that. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=293.03999999999996s)]
*  If this is about people waving Mexican flags, lighting cars on fire and dancing around for [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=294.71999999999997s)]
*  cell phone cameras, then that obviously favors the people doing the immigration crackdown. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=300.0s)]
*  So, yeah, this is an administration that is much more focused on politics and PR than [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=304.56s)]
*  I think any administration that we've seen. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=309.96s)]
*  I don't think that's a huge statement to make. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=312.32s)]
*  That is their focus. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=314.71999999999997s)]
*  You know, every White House has a political focus. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=316.15999999999997s)]
*  It is effectively the entire focus for this White House. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=318.84s)]
*  And by the way, it starts at the top. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=322.47999999999996s)]
*  You have a president who is online doing kind of color commentary in a way that is [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=324.47999999999996s)]
*  almost detached. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=330.44s)]
*  It's almost like he's somebody passively watching this on TV, which he is, instead [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=331.44s)]
*  of actually running the country. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=336.44s)]
*  And I think it starts at that. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=338.32s)]
*  And then you have everybody else around him. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=340.0s)]
*  DOJ, DOD, who's in this kind of competition to one up the other to show the principle [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=342.4s)]
*  how tough they can be, too. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=348.56s)]
*  And I think that leads us where we are today. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=350.4s)]
*  That's often true for the Trump presidency, where he acts as a bystander to have comments [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=352.08s)]
*  as things are happening rather than trying to to influence events. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=357.24s)]
*  But his rhetoric, though, does could have some consequences here. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=360.36s)]
*  And John Holman, you are you're an L.A. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=362.88s)]
*  guy, obviously a city you know and love. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=364.52s)]
*  Talk to us a little bit about just your thoughts watching some of these scenes here, but [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=368.24s)]
*  also your take on what Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, has said and Mayor Bass, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=371.8s)]
*  mayor of Los Angeles, where they have both said and clearly, we don't want the National [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=377.2s)]
*  Guard here. We don't want this federal presence. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=382.08s)]
*  And they're accusing President Trump of sending them deliberately to provoke. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=384.56s)]
*  Well, first, I think, you know, you have seen obviously this. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=388.2s)]
*  So it's almost been like a linear effect here. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=391.88s)]
*  It's like the more there's been any kind of the soon as you get the National Guard, things [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=395.03999999999996s)]
*  escalated. Governor Newsom's right. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=398.64s)]
*  There was anything like a riot happening on Friday, Saturday. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=400.35999999999996s)]
*  The thing that provoked this was not yet anything that approached riot standards. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=402.88s)]
*  The L.A. Police Department, yeah, police commissioner yesterday said, you know, that he [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=406.76s)]
*  would reevaluate. He didn't want the National Guard or initially. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=411.56s)]
*  But now the circumstances on the street were getting worse and he might reevaluate that [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=415.6s)]
*  decision if you were asked today. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=419.16s)]
*  And this is what's so toxic about this environment, right, which is that I think that [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=420.56s)]
*  Governor Newsom and Mayor Bass understand exactly what this logic of escalation is. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=424.88s)]
*  There are not two equal sides here where you have Donald Trump's administration on one [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=429.8s)]
*  side and somehow Democrats on the other. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=434.6s)]
*  Gavin Newsom, Karen Bass, do not have control over what happens on the streets of Los [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=436.68s)]
*  Angeles. And what Donald Trump has is perfect control now over the people in his [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=439.56s)]
*  administration. You go back five years ago, almost to the day is when the clashes [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=444.76s)]
*  happened in Lafayette Square, where you where we know that Donald Trump was [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=449.44s)]
*  proposing the notion of the Invoking the Interest Act and shooting protesters in the [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=452.96s)]
*  leg. Mark Esper, Mark Milley said no. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=456.03999999999996s)]
*  There is no one now in the Trump administration who will say no to Donald Trump. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=459.44s)]
*  But in fact, as Jonathan said, you've got this internal escalatory. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=462.52s)]
*  There's a bidding war. There's a bidding war to see who will be the fastest. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=465.76s)]
*  Pete Hegseth is not going to be Mark Esper in 2025. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=470.08s)]
*  And that's where the danger lies, because is as they continue to ratchet up the force [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=473.52000000000004s)]
*  levels on the street, it's not like Governor Newsom and Karen Bass, no matter what they [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=478.56s)]
*  want to do, can in some way back off. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=482.84000000000003s)]
*  They don't have control of what's happening on the streets with the people who are [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=485.6s)]
*  protesting or rioting, whatever it comes to. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=488.0s)]
*  And that's why there's kind of this escalatory, this kind of uncontrollable escalatory [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=490.36s)]
*  framework that favors in some ways the Trump administration, because I agree with [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=495.0s)]
*  Jonathan 100 percent. As long as this is seen, if the protests are peaceful and [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=499.32s)]
*  seen as righteous, right, bad for the administration. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=503.32s)]
*  If they start to look like riots and if they seem to be out of control and they're [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=505.76s)]
*  violent, they favor the politics, favor the administration and the administration can [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=510.12s)]
*  provoke those with perfect discipline on the Trump side. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=514.3199999999999s)]
*  They can provoke those scenes on the streets to be more violent. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=518.76s)]
*  That's my question for the table, Jay Martin, I'll throw it at you. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=523.92s)]
*  But I mean, who's who's the person who's got the voice, who's got the [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=528.0s)]
*  platform to be able to say to protesters and demonstrators and people who want to [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=533.24s)]
*  help the terrified migrants who are being focused on here in Los Angeles, being [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=540.6s)]
*  focused on by ICE and say, don't clash with police, do not clash with authorities. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=546.48s)]
*  Who can send that message in a compelling way? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=552.96s)]
*  How can Gavin Newsom or Mayor Bass get that megaphone to be loud enough to to send [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=555.44s)]
*  that message? Who is the person? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=563.04s)]
*  Well, I think it would be Gavin Newsom if he had the opportunity. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=564.92s)]
*  And I wouldn't be surprised if you saw him at some point this week try to give [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=568.3199999999999s)]
*  remarks to that. And then I think there's there's ways that you can channel this. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=571.92s)]
*  And look, I think the politics of this are challenging for Newsom because of the [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=575.8399999999999s)]
*  images of violence. And to John's point, you can't control a sort of ragtag group [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=580.7199999999999s)]
*  of protesters that include some people who are out there, you know, obviously [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=586.64s)]
*  exercising their First Amendment rights and others who are out there just stirring [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=590.64s)]
*  up chaos. So Newsom doesn't have a ton of control. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=593.96s)]
*  I think what he may want to do, though, is try to sort of summon people to their [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=597.56s)]
*  their better angels, organize some kind of a separate protest in which you sort of [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=603.92s)]
*  get away from what's been happening the last few days and do this in a more [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=608.1999999999999s)]
*  organized, disciplined fashion, or at least try to do that. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=612.0s)]
*  And you push folks away from the streets, you know, and the way that they've been [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=615.3199999999999s)]
*  out there the last few days. I just don't know if that's possible, but you can tell [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=619.44s)]
*  people to sort of stop taking the streets because this is so organic and there's [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=622.9200000000001s)]
*  always so much that Newsom can do. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=626.96s)]
*  But there's no question that he's got to try because if we keep seeing the images [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=628.8000000000001s)]
*  that we're seeing on TV the last few days, obviously it's challenging for the [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=633.44s)]
*  country and it's deeply challenging for Newsom's politics and for the broader [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=638.2800000000001s)]
*  politics of the opposition in this country. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=642.7600000000001s)]
*  you [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJNj3355JuE&t=649.44s)]
