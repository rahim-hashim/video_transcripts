# 'Shocked': Book details how 'radical,' 'sweeping' Project 2025 is influencing Trump WH
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [April 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw)
*  We want the Democrats to be traumatically affected. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=0.0s)]
*  When they wake up in the morning, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=3.64s)]
*  we want them to not want to go to work, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=4.88s)]
*  because they are increasingly viewed as the villains. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=8.08s)]
*  We want their funding to be shut down [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  so that the EPA can't do all of the rules [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=15.0s)]
*  against our energy industry, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=18.26s)]
*  because they have no bandwidth financially to do so. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=19.68s)]
*  We want to put them in trauma. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  Okay, that was Project 2025 Architect Russell Vogt [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=26.04s)]
*  speaking to a conservative group in 2023, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=30.88s)]
*  explaining what a second Trump administration would mean [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=34.48s)]
*  for unelected federal workers. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=38.72s)]
*  Vogt currently serves now as the Director [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=41.32s)]
*  of the Office of Management and Budget [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=44.14s)]
*  in the Trump administration, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=46.04s)]
*  which has been involved in the downsizing [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  of the federal government. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=50.4s)]
*  Joining us now, staff writer at The Atlantic, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=52.56s)]
*  David A. Graham. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=54.839999999999996s)]
*  He is the author of the new book entitled The Project, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=55.8s)]
*  How Project 2025 is Reshaping America. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=59.8s)]
*  David, thank you so much for being with us. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  You know, I'm so glad our crack staff, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=65.28s)]
*  who get so much sleep working through the night, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=69.6s)]
*  actually got that quote, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=72.36s)]
*  because I think it's one of the most important quotes [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=73.75999999999999s)]
*  to understand when all the chaos [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=76.12s)]
*  was unfolding the first month. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=79.4s)]
*  People say, what's happening? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=81.68s)]
*  It was all according to plan, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=84.0s)]
*  even traumatizing federal workers, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=87.72s)]
*  as Russell Vogt says there, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=91.28s)]
*  that was I think in 2023, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=93.08000000000001s)]
*  he said, we want to traumatize them so much [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=94.88000000000001s)]
*  that they don't want to go to work. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=97.36000000000001s)]
*  Right, it looks like chaos to us, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=99.92s)]
*  but it's totally planned. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=101.36000000000001s)]
*  It's the way they played it out. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=102.4s)]
*  And I think the way, you know, hear him talk, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  he sounds so mild-mannered [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=105.28s)]
*  and he's saying these really radical things. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=106.4s)]
*  And I think that's true of a lot of Project 2025, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=107.92s)]
*  which sounds very technocratic and bland, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=110.52000000000001s)]
*  and is in fact a really radical plan [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=113.11999999999999s)]
*  to remake American society. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=114.75999999999999s)]
*  And talk about what's at the heart of that. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=116.44s)]
*  I, you know, Republican came in in 1994. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=119.44s)]
*  We wanted to get rid of four cabinet agencies. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=123.44s)]
*  We wanted to downsize the federal government. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=127.19999999999999s)]
*  Is this a natural out shoot of that? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=129.95999999999998s)]
*  Is that sort of that conservative- [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=133.35999999999999s)]
*  Waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=135.76s)]
*  Waste, fraud and abuse, sell the spectrum, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=136.84s)]
*  all these things we were doing [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=140.35999999999999s)]
*  to try to balance the budget. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=141.72s)]
*  It seems to me though, this takes it a step further. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=143.76s)]
*  Nobody, nobody, we were always talking [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=147.6s)]
*  about balancing the budget. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=149.2s)]
*  Nobody ever said, let's traumatize federal workers. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, there's a connection [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=153.8s)]
*  to that older conservatism, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=154.72s)]
*  but I think this is another step beyond. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=155.92s)]
*  I mean, it's a willingness to, first of all, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=157.2s)]
*  it's trying to accrue a lot of executive power, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=158.84s)]
*  which is, you know, traditionally not something [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=160.8s)]
*  the conservatives would like, of course. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=162.88s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=163.72s)]
*  And it's about using the coercive power of the government [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=165.04s)]
*  to affect people's lives. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=167.07999999999998s)]
*  I think in a way that other conservatives [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=168.36s)]
*  have resisted for a long time. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=169.64s)]
*  I've got to say, Rev, that's a great point too. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=172.36s)]
*  We were such dorks. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=174.04000000000002s)]
*  We'd wear article one buttons, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=176.92000000000002s)]
*  basically saying it starts with us. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=178.76000000000002s)]
*  Funding starts with us. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=180.60000000000002s)]
*  Don't try to do anything. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=181.72s)]
*  We were against the imperial presidency. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=182.8s)]
*  That's completely changed too. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=185.08s)]
*  That's completely changed. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=186.8s)]
*  And one of the things I think is important [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=188.4s)]
*  about David's book is that those of us [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=190.08s)]
*  that have opposed this administration, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=192.88s)]
*  whether it's the left or civil rights people or whatever, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=194.92000000000002s)]
*  don't understand, they have a plan [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=198.36s)]
*  and your strategy has to address their plan [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=200.64s)]
*  because you could inadvertently help their plan [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=204.12s)]
*  by adding to the trauma and the drama [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=206.96s)]
*  and doing things that feed right into the image [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=210.32s)]
*  they want to counter you. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=213.64s)]
*  Talk about how methodical their plan is [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=215.51999999999998s)]
*  and you have to have a methodical counter plan [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=218.4s)]
*  if you're gonna win this. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=221.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  I mean, it's amazing for them to lay this out. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=222.92s)]
*  They put this on the internet 18 months before the election [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=224.16s)]
*  and people kind of ignored it. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=226.92s)]
*  We talked about it a little during the election last year, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=228.12s)]
*  but I think people just didn't really understand [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=231.20000000000002s)]
*  how sweeping it was. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=232.88s)]
*  And when I sat down to read the whole thing, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=233.76s)]
*  even having read bits and pieces a lot, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=236.32s)]
*  I was shocked at just how radical it was [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=238.12s)]
*  and how sweeping it was. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=240.28s)]
*  So in fairness, we should remind people [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=241.32s)]
*  the Harris campaign made this the centerpiece [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=242.92000000000002s)]
*  of their argument against Donald Trump. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=245.28s)]
*  They said, read project 2025 if you wanna know [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=246.88s)]
*  what the second Trump administration would look like. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=249.24s)]
*  And here it is, Donald Trump during the campaign said, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=251.72s)]
*  I don't know anything about it. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=253.96s)]
*  I don't know who these people are. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=255.0s)]
*  It's what he does. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=256.12s)]
*  Let's be more specific about how some of that document [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=257.2s)]
*  has now been translated into policy in the country. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=261.0s)]
*  What have we seen in these first couple of months? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=263.91999999999996s)]
*  Well, I think so much of what we've seen, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=265.76s)]
*  whether it's the executive orders on day one and on day two [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=266.96s)]
*  and since then, those are straight [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=269.79999999999995s)]
*  from a playbook they put out. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=271.56s)]
*  You look at the layouts of federal workers, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=273.15999999999997s)]
*  you see attempts to close the education department. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=275.15999999999997s)]
*  It's just point by point right from here. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=278.28s)]
*  And I think the thing that gets missed [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=280.44s)]
*  is people talk about the policies, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=281.76s)]
*  but it's so much a scheme for how to rework [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=283.56s)]
*  the entire shape of government. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=287.32s)]
*  And that's something that I think maybe [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=288.16s)]
*  didn't come through during the campaign. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=289.12s)]
*  So, David, tell us what's still to come. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=289.96s)]
*  So I know you recently wrote about how you feel like [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=291.48s)]
*  what project 2025's next focus, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=294.0s)]
*  administration's next focus might be [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=296.08s)]
*  actually on the family, explain that. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=297.40000000000003s)]
*  I think the focus on the family [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=299.76s)]
*  is maybe the most important thing for a lot of the authors. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=301.40000000000003s)]
*  They care very deeply about this. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=303.8s)]
*  They want a very traditional Christian family, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=305.12s)]
*  biblically based vision, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=307.24s)]
*  fathers working, mothers raising children. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=309.48s)]
*  Obviously anti-abortion policy is a big part of this. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=312.12s)]
*  And because this is so deeply held, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=314.72s)]
*  it sort of suffuses the whole project. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=316.36s)]
*  I think this is something we haven't seen a lot so far, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=318.84000000000003s)]
*  but it's gonna be very important [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=320.72s)]
*  in the months and years to come. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=322.04s)]
*  How do you implement that through, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=323.92s)]
*  I mean, because again, this is the sort of thing [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=325.92s)]
*  that conservatives, small government conservatives [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=327.32s)]
*  would say, stay out of our homes. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=329.64s)]
*  That's right. We'll take care of ourselves. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=332.12s)]
*  Through every part of the government. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=333.68s)]
*  So that's the Department of Health and Human Services. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=334.92s)]
*  That's using the Department of Labor to track statistics. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=336.96000000000004s)]
*  It's using, you name it, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=339.4s)]
*  every department becomes part of the scheme. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=342.36s)]
*  David, let me ask you really quickly. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=345.44s)]
*  Do you think the administration and maybe Russell Vought [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=346.36s)]
*  and other people are surprised at the, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=351.68s)]
*  something that I will say didn't surprise me at all, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=355.44s)]
*  the pushback? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=359.44s)]
*  Washington always wins. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=360.8s)]
*  Now it may take Washington longer to win, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=363.12s)]
*  but Washington always wins in the end [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=365.92s)]
*  because we've all seen every administration, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=368.84000000000003s)]
*  we're gonna comment, we're gonna change everything. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=371.04s)]
*  The people before us were idiots, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=373.08s)]
*  we're smarter than everybody else. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=374.4s)]
*  And like you go see them a year later, go, how you doing? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=375.84s)]
*  Was the Bush administration really as dumb [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=379.28s)]
*  as you thought they were? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=381.8s)]
*  Were the Obamas really as dumb as you thought they were? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=382.64s)]
*  You know, like, are they, do you think they're surprised [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=385.64s)]
*  at the pushback that they've gotten from all angles? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=389.64s)]
*  Yeah, I think Russell Vought was prepared for this. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=392.96s)]
*  You know, he's such an insider. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=395.08s)]
*  He spent so much time in government. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=396.36s)]
*  He knew this was gonna happen. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=397.47999999999996s)]
*  He knew this was gonna come in, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=398.32s)]
*  and that's why he wanted to move so quickly. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=399.28s)]
*  That's why he wanted to be ready on day one. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=401.0s)]
*  What about Elon Musk? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=402.84s)]
*  What about Elon Musk? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=404.08s)]
*  You think Elon Musk might be a little surprised right now [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=405.08s)]
*  by what he's faced and how he's lost half of his fortune? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=407.8s)]
*  Maybe, I don't know the exact numbers, so. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=412.04s)]
*  I think he is surprised [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=414.16s)]
*  because he clearly doesn't understand how Washington works. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=415.28000000000003s)]
*  And you know, Vought is happy to use him as a vessel, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=417.58s)]
*  get that as far as he can, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=419.36s)]
*  and then he'll move on to the next thing. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=420.36s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=422.36s)]
*  And cost him $100, $150 billion in the process. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=423.88s)]
*  Russell, thank you. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=428.64s)]
*  Punch the clock on your way back to California. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=429.6s)]
*  The new book, The Project, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=433.4s)]
*  How Project 2025 is Reshaping America is on sale now. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=435.16s)]
*  Author and staff writer at The Atlantic, David A. Graham. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=439.48s)]
*  Thank you very much for coming on this morning. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=442.24s)]
*  Congratulations on the book. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=444.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srlLnVeJlLw&t=462.56s)]
