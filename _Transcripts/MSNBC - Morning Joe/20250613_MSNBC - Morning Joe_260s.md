# What happens next after Israel launches airstrikes in Iran?
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU)
*  The New York Times puts it this way this morning, a remarkable coup of intelligence and military [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=0.0s)]
*  force that immediately decapitated Tehran's chain of command. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=4.64s)]
*  So Richard Haass, let's talk about what comes next. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=9.36s)]
*  Obviously, this is a loud attack. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=12.52s)]
*  They got the attention of the world this morning. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=14.64s)]
*  Pardon Mr. Netanyahu, who says there is more to come. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=16.68s)]
*  We will go, he says, for as many days as it takes. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=19.54s)]
*  What is your read about what that means? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=23.68s)]
*  As many days as it takes to do what? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=25.52s)]
*  To destroy their nuclear capabilities? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=28.04s)]
*  What is the aim here for Israel? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=31.04s)]
*  Well, the phase of going after the Iranian military and nuclear personnel, I think, is [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=33.28s)]
*  probably over because you no longer have surprise. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  Israel seems to have already pretty much degraded Iranian air defenses. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=41.92s)]
*  So what's left is a number of facilities and installations associated with the nuclear [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=47.16s)]
*  program. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=51.86s)]
*  I obviously haven't seen damage assessments of places like Netanz, not far from Tehran, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=52.9s)]
*  which is one of the main facilities. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=58.54s)]
*  You've got various reactors around the countries. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=60.1s)]
*  As I mentioned before, you've got this large underground hard-to-reach facility at Fordow. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=62.62s)]
*  So it could be that the Israelis will have a kind of open-ended campaign along their [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=68.74s)]
*  own time schedule, not rushed. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=73.46000000000001s)]
*  They'll attack, they'll do assessment. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=75.9s)]
*  If need be, they'll attack some more. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=78.9s)]
*  There's still going to be limits, I think, on what they can accomplish. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=80.26s)]
*  And that's why, again, I think this could play out over a long amount of time, where [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=84.22s)]
*  Iran then can choose the means and locations of its retaliation. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=88.02000000000001s)]
*  And then also Iran's going to have to make some big decisions, not just about reconstituting [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=93.14s)]
*  their leadership, which has been devastated here, but also about reconstituting their [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=96.98s)]
*  nuclear program. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=101.46000000000001s)]
*  And one of the arguments, again, that's historically been raised against Israel doing this type [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=102.46000000000001s)]
*  of a preventive strike is that Iran would be the recipient of a degree of international [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=108.5s)]
*  sympathy and would basically say, we tried to work it out diplomatically. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=114.14s)]
*  It didn't work. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=118.1s)]
*  So now we're going to underground do our own program in ways that Israel can't reach. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=119.1s)]
*  I'm not necessarily predicting that. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=123.3s)]
*  But I don't think we should look at this really, that somehow this issue now is quote-unquote [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=125.52000000000001s)]
*  solved. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=128.9s)]
*  I think this is more yet another kind of point of punctuation along a long road here that [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=129.9s)]
*  has been playing out for some time. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=135.7s)]
*  And to Richard's point about watching for the next steps from both Iran and Israel, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=137.85999999999999s)]
*  we also, of course, have to watch Washington. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=141.42s)]
*  President Trump has made clear he does not want conflict. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=144.18s)]
*  He wants wars to end and end quickly. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=147.04s)]
*  We're seeing that, of course, in Ukraine. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=148.94s)]
*  We're seeing that in Gaza. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=150.62s)]
*  We're seeing that in the Middle East. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=151.62s)]
*  That's what he says with his rhetoric, that very few actions have led that to happen. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=152.62s)]
*  We should make that clear. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=157.35999999999999s)]
*  It seems like for now the U.S. is as, say, maybe they acquiesced to this attack, but [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=159.5s)]
*  they're standing on the sidelines. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=163.26s)]
*  They're stressing. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=164.26s)]
*  They were not intimately involved. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=165.29999999999998s)]
*  The president, again, just a few moments ago, saying he still hopes for a diplomatic solution [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=166.46s)]
*  to bring this conflict to a close. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=170.86s)]
*  You've also seen as what happens when there's violence in the Middle East, oil prices are [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=172.26000000000002s)]
*  already starting to rise this morning. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=176.58s)]
*  And Willie, we also should look at the relationship between President Trump and Prime Minister [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=180.02s)]
*  Netanyahu, one that was very close in Trump's first term, but has grown rather strained [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=184.26000000000002s)]
*  here in recent months. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=190.26000000000002s)]
*  President, of course, skipped Israel on his recent Middle East visit. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=191.78s)]
*  He was able to talk Netanyahu out of a strike back in the spring. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=195.94s)]
*  That didn't happen this time around. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=200.46s)]
*  Netanyahu has showed a willingness to defy, defied President Biden at times, seemingly [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=202.38s)]
*  maybe doing so again here with President Trump. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=207.9s)]
*  So we'll need to watch that relationship. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=209.98s)]
*  What kind of conversations, what kind of meetings perhaps do these two men have as Washington [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=212.14s)]
*  tries to chart its next steps in what is obviously now a situation that for a lot of people raises [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=216.14s)]
*  fears of a wider war. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=222.94s)]
*  And we heard President Trump just a minute ago in that clip saying explicitly Iran cannot [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=225.28s)]
*  have a nuclear weapon. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=229.16s)]
*  That appears to be the mission pursued now as of this morning by Israel as well. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=231.0s)]
*  Richard Haass, David Ignatius, great to have you both on on such an important morning. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=234.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=238.98000000000002s)]
*  Still ahead on more. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdwhbfKBAOU&t=239.98000000000002s)]
