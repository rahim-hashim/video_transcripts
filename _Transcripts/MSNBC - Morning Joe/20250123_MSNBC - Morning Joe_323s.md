# 'Will become even more unpopular': Why Trump may come to regret pardons
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [January 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY)
*  Let's turn now though back to January 6th Ankush. We want to get into your piece here talking about how Trump may come to regret [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=0.0s)]
*  His January 6 pardons walk us through your argument with one reason being I believe it's not like these [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=6.7s)]
*  Pardon convicts are simply going to go away quietly into the night [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=14.06s)]
*  Yeah, Jonathan. I think that is actually the marquee point here, but just to level set with some facts that you and much of your audience know [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=17.64s)]
*  600 people were charged with assaulting or resisting officers [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=25.72s)]
*  170 plus were charged with with offenses involving a deadly weapon or serious injuries to officers [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=29.099999999999998s)]
*  The polling around January 6 despite what Trump and his allies have said has always generated a large [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=35.36s)]
*  Bipartisan majority of people who disapprove of what happened that day that is still true [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=41.86s)]
*  The numbers are lower among Republicans, but across the country as a whole that is still true [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=45.9s)]
*  Large numbers of people some around 60 60 plus percent already opposed Trump's plans to do these pardons [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=50.42s)]
*  These defendants are now going to be in public forever, right? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=56.879999999999995s)]
*  Stuart Rhodes Enrique a terrio the QAnon shaman these people are already out in public saying on you know [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=60.8s)]
*  disturbing things Jackson ref it who was a [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=67.16s)]
*  Witness against his father in the first January 6 case that went to trial was on air talking to one of your colleagues [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=70.72s)]
*  A day or two ago [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=77.84s)]
*  I think Chris Janssen talking about how he has been getting death threats in the wake of the pardons last but not least [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=79.0s)]
*  In general [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=85.27999999999999s)]
*  Violent offenders in the in the federal criminal justice system go on to commit more violent offenses [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=86.88s)]
*  Roughly two-thirds of them will engage in some form of recidivism [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=92.11999999999999s)]
*  And who knows what that recidivism might look like in this context a lot of these people were of course all involved with a [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=95.36s)]
*  Political crime and Trump has now sent a very disturbing message to those people and his supporters [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=101.35999999999999s)]
*  Which is effectively that if you engage in political violence on my behalf it is okay [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=106.36s)]
*  And and I just don't I don't think this is the last of what we're gonna hear from these people and we're gonna see [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=111.4s)]
*  Civic society the media nonprofits universities following these people now that they're back in in society [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=115.94s)]
*  Well, I think I think you're exactly right too. This is going to be [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=124.80000000000001s)]
*  You're going to have this continuing to follow the administration around [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=132.16s)]
*  following [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=138.64000000000001s)]
*  Republicans around because as you said you had one person saying after after pardoned [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=139.84s)]
*  I'm gonna go out and get some [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=146.16s)]
*  MF and guns you of course we just played [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=148.68s)]
*  you know [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=154.36s)]
*  you know threats of retribution and [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=155.72s)]
*  What is again so so bitterly ironic for me as a conservative? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=158.92000000000002s)]
*  Is that conservatives have long said what you said right there [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=165.08s)]
*  violent criminals need to be locked up because violent criminals will come out and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=169.56s)]
*  Create even more crimes earlier this morning when we were talking about the deportation of illegal immigrants who committed crimes [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=176.36s)]
*  I talked about Giuliani's broken windows theory that has always split [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=183.52s)]
*  There's always been a divide and conservatives have always believed [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=188.92000000000002s)]
*  You get people that are committing the small crimes that will that will have a cumulative impact and and [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=193.48000000000002s)]
*  And stop huge crime waves here. You have people committing violent acts against law enforcement officers [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=200.76000000000002s)]
*  Coming out saying hey, thanks for the pardon. I'm buying guns [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=209.64000000000001s)]
*  Basically, we're seeking retribution and you're right [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=214.92000000000002s)]
*  This is going to stay in the news and forget lefties forget righties forget [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=218.32000000000002s)]
*  ideology forget college professors like [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=226.0s)]
*  forget think tanks [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=229.16s)]
*  Americans are gonna see this and it's going to have a negative impact on their view of Donald Trump of the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=232.20000000000002s)]
*  administration of the Republican Party, especially if they don't speak out against the violence [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=240.56s)]
*  Yeah, I totally agree [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=246.16s)]
*  I mean, this is not going to be a one-day or a one-week story [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=247.36s)]
*  I think it's it you know Trump is beginning his his second term with a very unpopular policy [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=250.56s)]
*  and this isn't the first time Trump has begun a [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=256.16s)]
*  Term in office with unified control of the government and entering in coming in with a whole bunch of unpopular things a whole bunch of bravado [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=259.76s)]
*  and what happened in 2018 was that the house flipped and [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=266.36s)]
*  You know [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=270.48s)]
*  You know, I just think that you know the bravado that we're hearing from Trump and his allies is just that it's a bit [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=272.08s)]
*  Of a posture and I think in this particular case as the facts and information continues to devout to the public about what these [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=277.56s)]
*  Parting defendants actually did what they are currently doing now and what they may do in the future [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=284.68s)]
*  I expect this decision will become even more unpopular [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=289.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, the new piece is online now for Politico senior writer for Politico magazine on Kush Kuduri [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=291.91999999999996s)]
*  Thank you very much for coming on the show this morning. We appreciate it [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFtQa4GwgIY&t=298.52s)]
