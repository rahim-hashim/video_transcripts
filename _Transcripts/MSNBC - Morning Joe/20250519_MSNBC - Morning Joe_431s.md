# 'A lot of storm clouds': Trump to speak with Putin in high-stakes phone call
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4)
*  President Trump is expected to speak by phone with Russia's Vladimir Putin later this morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump made the announcement on his social media platform yesterday, saying their discussion [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  will focus on finding an end to the war. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  Last night, French President Emmanuel Macron said he'd spoken to Trump, as well as his [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=13.72s)]
*  counterparts in the UK, Germany, and Italy. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=18.96s)]
*  Macron called on Putin to accept the 30-day ceasefire proposed by the U.S. and Ukraine. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=23.04s)]
*  It comes days after Ukrainian and Russian teams held their first direct talks since [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=29.919999999999998s)]
*  the war began. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=36.64s)]
*  Let's bring in President Emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations, Richard Haas. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=37.64s)]
*  He's the author of the weekly newsletter, Home and Away, available on Substack. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  And columnist and associate editor for The Washington Post, David Ignatius. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=47.16s)]
*  Good to have you both. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=52.68s)]
*  And Joe, this phone call, of course, after talks that involved lower-level staff members [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=53.68s)]
*  that didn't have some progress. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=60.32s)]
*  Lower-level staff members and the pope. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=65.24000000000001s)]
*  The pope talked about this, too. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  Richard, we have much to talk to you about. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=71.04s)]
*  Golfing, the preakness, just the extraordinary ending of the preakness. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=73.68s)]
*  But why don't we start where Cady and I were talking, and that was the election. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=78.84s)]
*  We had a conversation held last night, once again, to quote John Meacham, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=82.36s)]
*  populism is a strong starter, but not always the strongest of finishers. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=87.16s)]
*  And if you look at the last two elections in France, look at the election in Poland, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=91.96s)]
*  look at Poland, I mean, I could go around Europe, and time and time again, we have seen [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=96.28s)]
*  that in the ultimate races for power in European countries, well, and of course, we can talk [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=104.11999999999999s)]
*  about Canada, we can talk about Australia. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=110.12s)]
*  The same story is being rewritten time and time again this year, is it not? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=112.8s)]
*  Absolutely. These things go in cycles, Joe. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=117.96s)]
*  You know this. Politics has pendulums and there's nothing automatic and often there's [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  an anti-status quo and that could help populists. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=125.8s)]
*  It could also hurt populists in some ways if they're the incumbents. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=128.68s)]
*  Well, it's a very interesting test in this country, in the midterms and then again in [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=132.32s)]
*  because ultimately elections become referenda on the status quo and on the trajectory, as [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=137.28s)]
*  people see it, of the country. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=142.4s)]
*  So populists don't have, shall we say, any sort of a structural advantage. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=144.88s)]
*  David, let's turn to the call that President Trump is going to have, what, in four hours time, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=150.95999999999998s)]
*  I'm looking at the clock, with President Putin. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=155.68s)]
*  Clearly an important call in the context of Putin not turning up in Istanbul, the two [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=158.64s)]
*  high-level principals not having that meeting in Istanbul. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=163.2s)]
*  What do you think, what are you looking for to come out of this? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=166.95999999999998s)]
*  Is it as simple as just setting the date for a meeting or are you going to look for more [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=169.83999999999997s)]
*  tea? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=174.0s)]
*  I don't think there'll be a breakthrough in this call other than to have a face-to-face. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=174.16s)]
*  President Trump has set up his own personal intervention as the key dynamic, basically [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=181.35999999999999s)]
*  saying this can't be solved without me. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=188.64000000000001s)]
*  And he's now interposing himself. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=191.44s)]
*  The phone call follows a series of rejections by Putin and his lower-level officials of [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=194.56s)]
*  virtually everything the United States has requested to end the war. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=201.52s)]
*  The U.S. asked for a 30-day ceasefire. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=205.92000000000002s)]
*  Ukraine said yes. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=207.84s)]
*  Russia said no. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=209.2s)]
*  The U.S. asked for meetings in Turkey at a high level. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=210.32s)]
*  President Trump was prepared to go from the Middle East to Turkey for those meetings. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=214.24s)]
*  The Ukraine was there. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=220.0s)]
*  President Zelensky was in Turkey. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=222.16s)]
*  Putin stayed away. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=225.44s)]
*  Everything we know, says the Russians, think they're winning and don't want to stop the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=227.2s)]
*  war without significant gains. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=231.28s)]
*  Right now they're demanding as a condition for a ceasefire, Ukrainian agreement to give [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=234.0s)]
*  up land that Russia hasn't conquered yet. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=239.12s)]
*  It's quite a demand. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=241.76s)]
*  So I think that Trump is facing a real problem here. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=243.36s)]
*  Unless he pushes Putin back and makes him understand you're not going to get the whole [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=248.72s)]
*  pie here, I think he's heading toward a meeting where he either makes a concessionary [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=253.12s)]
*  settlement to Putin, which will stay with him for the rest of his presidency, or he [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=258.96000000000004s)]
*  ends up in a real confrontation with Putin and the meeting breaks up in a difficult way. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=266.32s)]
*  Today's phone call will be a prelude to the real action which is coming. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=271.84s)]
*  But there are a lot of storm clouds in the sky as they pick up the phone. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=277.12s)]
*  The sequence of the calls is interesting. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=282.08s)]
*  Trump speaking with Putin first, then Zelensky, then Zelensky again with NATO allies. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=283.52s)]
*  When he spoke to Putin for the first time earlier this year, there was a lot of criticism [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=288.56s)]
*  that he spoke to Putin first and then sort of then Zelensky and sort of just informed [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=292.71999999999997s)]
*  Zelensky, hey, here's what Putin and I talked about, you should live with it. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=296.08s)]
*  There's a slightly different tenor this time around, Richard Haas, but David Ansh has kind [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=299.76s)]
*  of hinted at it. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=303.92s)]
*  The great question is, will President Trump ever stand up to Vladimir Putin? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=304.48s)]
*  He has not. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=308.64s)]
*  They've passed this prologue. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=309.28s)]
*  He's never done it. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=310.24s)]
*  And yet we see Putin defy American calls for ceasefire. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=311.92s)]
*  Some of the largest drone strikes of the entire war happened over the weekend in [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=315.12s)]
*  Kiev with the loss of civilian lives. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=319.92s)]
*  People I've talked to close to President Trump say he is eager, has been for a while, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=323.12s)]
*  eager to have a face to face with Vladimir Putin. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=327.52s)]
*  But usually if the president reaches a summit, reaches a presidential level, the deal is [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=330.71999999999997s)]
*  basically done. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=335.03999999999996s)]
*  And then you go and shake hands. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=336.0s)]
*  They're nowhere close here. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=337.76s)]
*  So what do you anticipate coming out of this call? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=339.35999999999996s)]
*  Is this the moment where Trump is finally going to get tough with Putin? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=342.71999999999997s)]
*  They're not in the same zip code. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=345.44s)]
*  Let's be honest. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=347.2s)]
*  Putin shows no interest in a deal. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=347.84s)]
*  David had it exactly right. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=349.91999999999996s)]
*  Putin wants to continue the war because he thinks he can accomplish his aims militarily. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=351.28s)]
*  Then he'll turn to diplomacy. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=355.52s)]
*  So for Donald Trump, at most he'll get a meeting with Putin. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=357.44s)]
*  And Putin, by the way, looks forward to that meeting because he thinks he'll get a lot [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=360.64s)]
*  of what he want, maybe a concessionary agreement. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=363.52s)]
*  The real issue is not going to happen at the table. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=366.08s)]
*  It's not going to happen in the call. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=368.15999999999997s)]
*  It's going to happen in Washington. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=369.59999999999997s)]
*  And it's going to be a decision by this administration whether they are going to resupply [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=370.96s)]
*  the pipeline to Ukraine. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=375.2s)]
*  Are they going to continue more military and intelligence support of Ukraine? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=376.88s)]
*  If they do that and they say, we're going to keep doing that, that is the [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=381.67999999999995s)]
*  only way to begin to shatter Vladimir Putin's confidence that time is on his side. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=385.12s)]
*  So it's quite simple. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=390.4s)]
*  It doesn't matter what the president says on the phone. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=391.36s)]
*  It doesn't matter what Witkoff says at the table. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=393.6s)]
*  The only thing that matters is whether they create a context or a structure for these [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=396.24s)]
*  negotiations where Putin realizes he either needs to compromise or he's going to have [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=400.56s)]
*  to continue fighting a war he cannot realize his objectives. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=406.16s)]
*  It's almost that simple. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtD495OPiG4&t=409.92s)]
