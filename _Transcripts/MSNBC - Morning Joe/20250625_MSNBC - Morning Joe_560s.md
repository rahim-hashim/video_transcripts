Video Description: An initial assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency concludes that the U.S. airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear enrichment sites over the weekend were not as effective as President Donald Trump said and that they set the country's nuclear program back by only three to six months, according to three people with knowledge of the report. Meanwhile, the president is doubling down on claiming the sites were totally obliterated.

# ‘Total obliteration’: Trump doubles down on Iran’s nuclear sites despite conflicting assessments
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8)
*  We hear it was obliteration. It was a virtual obliteration. When you take a look at the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=0.0s)]
*  ground above, don't forget, the flame is all underground. But everything above, if you [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=4.92s)]
*  look at the before and the after picture, everything above is burned black, the trees, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=9.36s)]
*  everything. There's one building, but that's a building that sunk substantially into the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=14.24s)]
*  granite, so that, you know, the fire goes right over it. It was, I believe it was total [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=18.52s)]
*  obliteration. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=24.8s)]
*  We will now turn to Iran. An initial assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency concludes [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=26.28s)]
*  that America's strikes on Iran were not as effective as President Trump has been claiming. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=33.32s)]
*  Earlier this week, Trump said the bombs, quote, completely obliterated Tehran's nuclear facilities. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=39.64s)]
*  But now three people with knowledge of the report say the strikes only set the country's [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=47.0s)]
*  program back by three to six months. One source told NBC News this. This assessment [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=52.6s)]
*  is already finding that these core pieces are still intact. The White House, however, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=59.68s)]
*  is strenuously denying the report. A statement from Press Secretary Carolyn Levin reads, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=64.76s)]
*  in part, this alleged assessment is flat out wrong and a clear attempt to demean President [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  Trump. Everyone knows what happens when you drop 14, 30,000-pound bombs perfectly on their [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=76.4s)]
*  targets. Total obliteration. According to Axios, Israeli intelligence service believe [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=84.0s)]
*  the strikes caused very significant damage to Iran's nuclear program, but they're still [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=90.80000000000001s)]
*  working on a final assessment. And Joe, we've heard from President Trump again this morning. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=96.0s)]
*  He's at The Hague for NATO meetings. He is also saying that, wait, no, this was a total [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=103.68s)]
*  success, that this was a total devastation of these sites. And we should be clear, this [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=109.16000000000001s)]
*  is still an initial assessment. Other agencies will do their own. But at minimum, this calls [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=114.52000000000001s)]
*  into question just how complete of a wipeout this was. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=120.36000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we just don't know yet. There are different assessments. David Ignatius, I just went [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=124.60000000000001s)]
*  through and sketched out a couple that I've seen so far. Of course, you have the president [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=132.67999999999998s)]
*  saying that the facilities were completely obliterated, as we just said. Israel said [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=137.23999999999998s)]
*  the damage was, quote, very significant and the Tants facility was, quote, completely [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=142.76s)]
*  destroyed. The defense intel assessment said that they didn't dismantle fundamental elements [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=148.88s)]
*  of the nuclear program. They delayed the program the three to six months. And the IAEA said [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=155.32s)]
*  it was, quote, directly impacted and some had, quote, extensive damage. So still, we're [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=160.68s)]
*  sort of in the fog of war right now. But tell us what you know, what you've heard, what [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=170.12s)]
*  we should be looking for. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=175.32s)]
*  So Joe, first, initial intelligence estimates are an art more than a science. It takes a [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=177.2s)]
*  while to have enough information to make good judgments. There's a history of policymakers [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=183.68s)]
*  being unhappy when intelligence analysts say that claims that people are making for, especially [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  for military programs, simply aren't being borne out on the ground. That happened repeatedly [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  with Iraq and Afghanistan. It happened with Vietnam. Consistently, intelligence analysts [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=202.52s)]
*  said these wars are not going the way policymakers think. Now we're seeing a new version of that. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=208.4s)]
*  The president's language is so hyperbolic, to use words like obliterated when you have [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=215.4s)]
*  no early evidence whatsoever, is just silly. And now the reaction to the analysts' initial [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=221.8s)]
*  comments—and I should note that the analysts themselves say they have low confidence in [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=232.56s)]
*  these estimates, meaning we have very little information to go on. But the reaction has [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=238.16s)]
*  been childish as to where that comes to mind. It's like there's no Santa Claus. What do [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=243.36s)]
*  you mean that wasn't obliterated? But I think it will be some days before we get really [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=248.04000000000002s)]
*  confirmed reliable accounts. The issue this raises to me is, well, if this was a worthy [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=256.64s)]
*  target, if destroying Iran's nuclear capability was something in the interest of the United [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=263.28000000000003s)]
*  States, then the implication of this first assessment that didn't set the program back [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=269.48s)]
*  by more than three to six months is correct. The implication is you're going to need to [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=277.04s)]
*  go back and bomb it again. So critics need to think carefully. As they say, oh my gosh, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=281.68s)]
*  this didn't accomplish anything, the military response would be, okay, need another mission. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=288.52000000000004s)]
*  Exactly. If in fact the nuclear program had to be destroyed and it is not destroyed, then there's [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=295.91999999999996s)]
*  the suggestion that either the U.S. has to strike again or Israel has to be allowed to continue [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=306.28s)]
*  strikes to try to finish off the facilities. You're right, a lot of people taking victory [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=313.76s)]
*  labs here saying that it wasn't destroyed. Well, that begs the question, okay, well, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=319.2s)]
*  what are you going to do now? Because again, let's be very, it doesn't matter who you voted [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=325.04s)]
*  for, whether you voted for Donald Trump or Kamala Harris or somebody else, understand, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=330.64000000000004s)]
*  a damaged, a battered Iran whose facilities aren't completely destroyed and who can rebuild those [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=336.64000000000004s)]
*  facilities will rebuild those facilities, rebuild them with even more urgency and the situation [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=346.88s)]
*  will be even more dangerous in the future. So a lot of tough choices still ahead for the president [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=353.76s)]
*  and for our allies and for political leaders in the United States. Let's bring it though right now, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=361.2s)]
*  NBC News senior White House correspondent Garrett Haig, he's in the Haig Netherlands where the NATO [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=367.2s)]
*  summit is underway. Garrett, what have you heard from the president so far this morning? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=372.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, Joe, it was interesting listening to your discussion because I think the president would [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=378.4s)]
*  disagree with your assessment. He this morning talked a great deal about Iran and those strikes, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=381.28s)]
*  casting them in historical terms and arguing that there's perhaps a third option here, that the [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=386.71999999999997s)]
*  strikes he believes were so successful that this question of whether the facilities were [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=391.84s)]
*  totally obliterated or not may be secondary if Iran's fighting spirit is effectively broken. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=396.88s)]
*  Listen to some of the manner in which the president describes the attacks and now this moment for Iran. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=403.2s)]
*  How long do you think that the Iranian nuclear program has been put back by these by these [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=409.84s)]
*  strikes? Years? I think basically decades because I don't think they'll ever do it again. I just [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=415.59999999999997s)]
*  don't think they're going to do it. I think they're going to take their oil, they're going to have some [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=422.24s)]
*  missiles and they'll have some defense. I think they've had it. I mean they just went through [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=426.71999999999997s)]
*  hell. I think they've had it. That hit ended the war. That hit ended the war. I don't want to use [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=432.16s)]
*  an example of Hiroshima. I don't want to use an example of Nagasaki. But that was essentially [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=439.04s)]
*  the same thing. That ended that war. This ended that with a war. If we didn't take that out, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=445.68s)]
*  they would have been, they'd be fighting right now. So you hear the president there, I think, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=450.48s)]
*  presenting perhaps the most optimistic case here that Iran is just going to be over it at this point [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=458.4s)]
*  and placing his decision to bomb these nuclear facilities without saying he wanted, saying he [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=462.56s)]
*  didn't want to, doing exactly what he said he didn't want to, putting them on the same footing [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=468.56s)]
*  as the American atomic strikes against Japan that ended World War II. Joe, as for the actual business [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=472.56s)]
*  of this summit, we've heard relatively little about it from President Trump. We know they're [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=477.67999999999995s)]
*  going to be talking about increasing defense spending across all of the NATO allies, something [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=481.2s)]
*  that's been a Trump issue for years, and also significant discussion about the war in Ukraine. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=485.28s)]
*  The president is set to meet with President Zelensky today after having to cancel on him at the G7 [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=490.4s)]
*  to head back to Washington to deal with the Iran crisis. They'll get another bite at the [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=495.2s)]
*  apple here today on those topics as well. All right, Garrett. Thank you so much. NBC's [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=498.96s)]
*  Garrett Haake reporting live from the Netherlands. Thank you so much. And just an editorial note, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=504.79999999999995s)]
*  Garrett said the president wouldn't like my assessment. That's not my assessment. That's [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=509.76s)]
*  the assessment coming from people in his administration. But again, it's early. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=513.12s)]
*  Israel is saying that perhaps there was more damage than we believe. But again, this is going [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=519.36s)]
*  to take a while to figure out exactly how much damage there are at the facilities. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gNno0NAwr8&t=527.2s)]
