# 'Difficult but necessary' decision brought Iran to the table, says House member
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU)
*  Joining us now Republican Congressman Mike Lawler of New York. He's a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=0.0s)]
*  Also chair of the Middle East and North Africa subcommittee congressman. Thank you for joining us this morning [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=5.64s)]
*  Obviously has just noted a head spinning 12 hours or so the ceasefire [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=11.76s)]
*  Appears to be back on though. We should note a very fragile fashion [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=17.44s)]
*  Let's get your reaction to this very strong reaction from President Trump and in particular [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=21.8s)]
*  He's very tough words for Israel [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=27.580000000000002s)]
*  Well, I think obviously you understand the president's frustration [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=31.380000000000003s)]
*  He gave Iran 60 days to negotiate the end of their nuclear program [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=35.1s)]
*  They chose not to obviously Israel's struck on the 61st day and then ultimately [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=40.92s)]
*  President Trump made the difficult but necessary decision to strike at Iran's nuclear facilities and [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=46.42s)]
*  That really did bring Iran to the table [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=53.660000000000004s)]
*  with our Qatari allies to be able to negotiate a [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=56.82s)]
*  Temporary ceasefire with the objective of getting to a longer term ceasefire [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=61.9s)]
*  And both sides agreed to it with a time certain and so obviously to have [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=67.38s)]
*  a back and forth as they approached the the 7 a.m. Hour and then of course [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=74.94s)]
*  Of course, you know right afterwards Iran [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=82.22s)]
*  Continuing forward so I understand the president's frustration. I think the objective here is to bring the temperature down [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=87.34s)]
*  Ensure this does not become a regional conflict [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=96.3s)]
*  Obviously, you know, we want long-term peace. We want shared prosperity in the region [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=100.46000000000001s)]
*  We want Iran to stop funding not only its nuclear program, but its ballistic missiles program [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=105.86s)]
*  Which they clearly have used to target innocent civilians in Israel as opposed to the targeted strikes at Iran's [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=112.18s)]
*  military and nuclear facilities [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=120.5s)]
*  And of course their funding of terror proxies for long-term peace [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=122.74000000000001s)]
*  All of that has to be part of the the discussion and the equation [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=127.62s)]
*  But in order to actually get there you need to have a ceasefire [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=132.46s)]
*  And so the president I think was right to be very forceful this morning [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=136.42000000000002s)]
*  And to impress upon both the Israelis and the Iranians the need for cooler heads to prevail [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=141.06s)]
*  So that this can proceed forward [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=147.54s)]
*  The president and route of course the NATO summit there in the Hague will be watching for further developments including any more posts from him [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=150.26s)]
*  While airborne Congress let's turn to matters here in Washington your capital Congress is back [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=156.58s)]
*  Let's talk about the so-called one big beautiful bill the Republican agenda here. I know you're a supporter of [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=162.1s)]
*  The salt cap the salt matter being included in this bill [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=168.1s)]
*  I know you know for you and some of your colleagues there in the Northeast a very important issue [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=172.0s)]
*  Still remains to be seen what happens to it in the Senate. However, what's the latest you've heard? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=175.94s)]
*  And if Senate comes back and the salt is not included. It's not to your liking. Would you still support this legislation? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=180.86s)]
*  No, I would vote no if the salt agreement that we negotiated [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=187.98s)]
*  Negotiated in good faith in the house is not included in the bill [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=193.54s)]
*  We worked with the speaker with the White House to come to that agreement after months of negotiations and conversations [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=197.29999999999998s)]
*  I've been very clear from the moment [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=205.06s)]
*  I ran for Congress that I would never support a tax bill that did not adequately lift the cap on salt [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=207.76s)]
*  This was a pay for in the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=213.34s)]
*  It paid for the doubling of the standard deduction the expanded child tax credit among other provisions [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=217.54s)]
*  Back then we understand this is a negotiation. We understood from the beginning [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=223.94s)]
*  We were not going to get unlimited salt [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=229.98s)]
*  But that we would get a higher number [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=232.66s)]
*  The Senate is talking about either going to 10,000 or phasing it out completely either of which [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=236.38s)]
*  Is dead on arrival as far as I'm concerned [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=243.3s)]
*  So I and my colleagues that are part of the salt caucus and Nick Lolota Andrew Garbarino young Kim and Tom Kane have all [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=246.7s)]
*  been very clear with the administration with [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=254.5s)]
*  Leadership in the house and with the Senate that they should keep the deal as is [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=258.5s)]
*  40,000 with a $500,000 income cap [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=263.98s)]
*  So let's follow up on this is Washington Post poll just released yesterday, it's about two to one [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=267.18s)]
*  Those surveyed opposed this bill with in particular concerns about how it's going to impact the national debt and these possible cuts [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=272.82s)]
*  To Medicaid. Why is this not resonating with Americans? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=279.70000000000005s)]
*  Well, I don't think frankly [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=285.22s)]
*  The the conversation has been accurate over the next 10 years were projected to spend 86 trillion dollars [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=287.22s)]
*  We're talking about potential savings of 1.5 trillion over that 10 year window [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=294.26s)]
*  That's about 1.7 percent of total spend even with the changes to Medicaid [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=300.09999999999997s)]
*  Within the House bill which includes eligibility verification speeding it up from an annual basis to a semi-annual basis [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=306.9s)]
*  Citizenship verification and make sure that illegal immigrants are not collecting Medicaid benefits and work requirements to make sure able-bodied adults with [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=314.09999999999997s)]
*  Dependents are working up to 80 hours a month even with those changes [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=322.26s)]
*  Medicaid is going to expand by 24 percent over that 10 year window [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=327.86s)]
*  So this is about slowing the rate of growth making sure the program is sustainable for the long term [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=332.82s)]
*  Now the other end of this is the tax bill if we don't pass a tax bill [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=338.82s)]
*  It will be the single largest tax increase in American history [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=343.3s)]
*  Which means the standard deduction which most Americans rely on will be cut in half and go back to the number that it was prior to 2017 [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=347.38s)]
*  It means the expanded child tax credit will be eliminated. It means the business tax credits will be eliminated [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=355.38s)]
*  Which will have a crushing blow on job creation and economic growth. It means no tax on tips. No tax on overtime [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=361.38s)]
*  Will not in fact take effect. So the tax bill is going to be the single largest tax increase in American history [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=367.38s)]
*  So the reality is when people fully understand what is actually in the bill as opposed to what my democratic colleagues have tried to say is in the bill [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=375.46s)]
*  They've tried to make this about gutting Medicaid for tax cuts for billionaires [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=383.46s)]
*  It's not even remotely close to what the bill actually does and so when we walk through it people actually agree [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=388.42s)]
*  They don't believe illegal immigrants should be collecting Medicaid benefits [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=396.42s)]
*  They do believe able-bodied adults should be trying to work, volunteer or go to school for 80 hours a month [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=400.46000000000004s)]
*  And they do believe that people who are ineligible should not be remaining on the program for well over a year [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=407.46000000000004s)]
*  Which is what the Biden administration allowed by lessening the rules when it came to eligibility [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=413.46000000000004s)]
*  Yes certainly though, your democratic colleagues have very different opinions there [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=419.46000000000004s)]
*  Also the non-partisan CBO says this would significantly add to the national debt and deficit [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=423.46000000000004s)]
*  Congressman before you let you go, we want to turn to an issue closer to home for you [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=427.5s)]
*  You represent areas not too far from New York City [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=430.5s)]
*  It is primary day here in New York for the Democratic Mayor's race [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=433.5s)]
*  You have weighed in and made it clear you aren't particularly fond of any of these candidates, understandably [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=438.5s)]
*  But a major issue though for the race is the idea of the federal government's involvement in big cities [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=443.5s)]
*  Particularly what we saw in Los Angeles, the idea of the ICE raids and using National Guard federal troops on the streets of American City [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=450.5s)]
*  All of these candidates say they oppose it [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=456.54s)]
*  Do you feel like that would be an appropriate use of federal authority in New York City? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=459.54s)]
*  Well when you have one of the candidates going into a federal courthouse [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=464.54s)]
*  Locking arms with an illegal immigrant to try and prevent ICE from detaining that individual [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=469.54s)]
*  That is wrong, it is a violation of federal laws, interfering with law enforcement's ability to do their job [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=476.54s)]
*  The fact is that you have had multiple protests in Los Angeles where they were spitting on ICE agents [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=483.58000000000004s)]
*  Throwing rocks at ICE agents, barricading ICE agents from detaining or removing people [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=490.58000000000004s)]
*  That is a violation of federal law [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=497.58000000000004s)]
*  I don't care what party you're in, I don't care what your politics are [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=499.58000000000004s)]
*  I don't care whether it was on January 6th or at a Minnesota police station or at a courthouse in Portland, Oregon [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=503.58000000000004s)]
*  Or on the streets of Los Angeles [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=510.58000000000004s)]
*  You do not interfere with, you do not put your hands on, you do not assault law enforcement, period [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=512.62s)]
*  And so I do believe that it was necessary to bring in the National Guard [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=518.62s)]
*  To maintain order, get it back under control and obviously proceed forward [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=523.62s)]
*  We should note though that one of the mayoral candidates, you just mentioned Brad Lander [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=529.62s)]
*  Department of Homeland Security spokesman claimed he assaulted an officer there [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=533.62s)]
*  But it's all on video, that did not occur [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=538.62s)]
*  He is among those on the ballot [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=541.66s)]
*  He locked arms with an illegal immigrant and interfered with law enforcement's ability to do their job [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=543.66s)]
*  I don't care who you are or what your title is, anybody else would have been arrested on the spot [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=550.66s)]
*  He does not have the right to do that just because he has a title [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=555.66s)]
*  The charges were later dropped [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=558.66s)]
*  Republican congressman Mike Waller of New York, thank you for joining us this morning, we appreciate it [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=560.66s)]
*  Thank you [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhs7GIr4vIU&t=571.62s)]
