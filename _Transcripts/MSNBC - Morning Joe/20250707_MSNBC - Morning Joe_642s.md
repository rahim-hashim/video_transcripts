# 'Let's make a deal' to legalize people to work and live in the U.S., says House member
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [July 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk)
*  Democratic Congressman Tom Swazi of New York wrote a letter to the president last month [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=0.0s)]
*  asking to meet to discuss immigration reforms after the migrant crackdown hit close to home [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=5.28s)]
*  for the lawmaker. And Congressman Swazi joins us now. It's good to have you on the show. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=11.44s)]
*  Congressman, very good to have you with us. Let's talk about some areas where there can be, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=16.96s)]
*  where Republicans and Democrats can come together, where Congress and the White House [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=24.48s)]
*  can come together for meaningful immigration reform. If you look at the southern border, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=29.28s)]
*  illegal crossings have dropped to, I think, record lows at least over the past 50, 60 years. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=35.68s)]
*  So it seems like that issue certainly is taken off the table for now. But what else can be done [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=44.72s)]
*  where we can stop seeing these images on TV because a bipartisan immigration bill has been [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  reached that the president will sign? Yeah, it's not going to be easy, but I think the cruelty [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  that you're hearing about this morning and the mistakes that you're going to see the administration [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=64.64s)]
*  make, like any government would make when they try to do a massive enforcement effort, will backfire [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=68.16s)]
*  on them. And we certainly, we have to continue to secure the border. The things the president has [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=72.4s)]
*  done have been successful, but if you want to make it permanent, we need the Congress to actually [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=77.36s)]
*  pass a law. We need to fix the broken asylum system. It's being abused by too many people [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=82.47999999999999s)]
*  for such a long period of time. And Democrats and Republicans have to stop fighting each other [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=87.92s)]
*  and have a common enemy. Our common enemy should be the cartels and the organized crime and the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=92.4s)]
*  people that are exploiting people, charging them $10,000 apiece to bring them to the southern border [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=97.12s)]
*  to show them how to break the rules for asylum. But most importantly is we need to legalize a [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=101.68s)]
*  bunch of these folks that have been here for a decade or more and have not committed crimes. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=106.64s)]
*  The president said the other day, and we have to lean into this, the president said, you know, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=111.6s)]
*  there's a lot of good people there that are working at these farms, that are working in [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=116.0s)]
*  hospitality, and they may not have the right documentation, but we have to use some common [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=119.28s)]
*  sense. Now, Stephen Miller is pushing against that, but the president has said this again [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=124.0s)]
*  on several occasions. We need to lean into that. Let's make a deal so that we can legalize, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=130.96s)]
*  not necessarily provide a pathway to citizenship, but legalize people so that they can work [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=136.8s)]
*  and live in the United States of America and pay taxes and live a decent life, especially if you've [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=142.4s)]
*  been here for 10 or 20 or 30 years and you haven't otherwise committed a crime. So let's figure out [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=148.16s)]
*  how the farm workers and the healthcare workers and the hospitality workers can live here and [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=154.16s)]
*  have a decent life. And you know, Congressman, you bring up such a great point. If the president [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=157.92s)]
*  and if other people in his party want these changes to be permanent, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  you don't do that by executive order, by executive fiat. You don't do that by changing [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=170.79999999999998s)]
*  some regulations. You do that by passing a bipartisan law. There seems to be an appetite [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=175.68s)]
*  for that now in Congress, where you can pass a bipartisan law and again, keep the border secure [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=183.04s)]
*  as it is right now, but also you talked about the people who've been here five, 10, 20, 25 years. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=191.68s)]
*  You know, I think about the mother whose two sons who served in the Marine Corps [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=198.88s)]
*  escorted her to her meeting on immigration. You know, here's a mom that worked hard, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=204.32s)]
*  raised two sons. They both served in uniform as United States Marines. You know, that's somebody [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=212.0s)]
*  we ought to figure out again, if not a pathway to citizenship without going back to her own country [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=220.16s)]
*  and then reapplying and being put on an expropriated list, at least allow her to be [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=226.64s)]
*  legal here because, you know, when you raise two United States Marines, you're doing a good job. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  And there are millions of stories like that, Joe, millions of stories in America of people [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=239.51999999999998s)]
*  working hard six days a week, going to church on Sunday, who just want to live a better life. And [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=244.48s)]
*  there are Democrats and Republicans in the Congress that want to do this. They want to get it done. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=249.27999999999997s)]
*  The Republicans are afraid of going out in front of the president. The president's given a little [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  bit of an opening by talking about farm workers and hospitality workers. We should expand that [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=257.92s)]
*  to other folks in essential industries. And we need to build a coalition, which I've been working [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=263.92s)]
*  on, but we have to do more of it, of business, badges, and the Bible. Put these folks together, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=268.0s)]
*  people that realize that these folks are essential to our economy, law enforcement that doesn't want [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=274.16s)]
*  to have to deal with this at the local level where people are afraid to report crimes because [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=279.04s)]
*  they're afraid they're going to get deported, and the Bible. People just care about other people [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=283.36s)]
*  who realize separating families is just inhumane. People who've been here for 10, 20, 30 years, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=288.56s)]
*  who don't even know the country they came from anymore, it's inhumane to send them back. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=294.16s)]
*  Congressman, your latest op-ed in the Wall Street Journal is about the New York Mayor's race, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=300.40000000000003s)]
*  and it's entitled For Democrats, Mamdani is a wake-up call and a bad example. And in it, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  you write in part, quote, Mr. Mamdani tapped into the same economic discontent, the same zeitgeist [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=312.48s)]
*  that powered Mr. Trump's rise. Democrats must recognize that the future starts with a message [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=319.6s)]
*  of economic security for American families. You continue, there's another way. Democrats can [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=325.6s)]
*  embrace the need to address the people's angst about the economy and affordability without [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=332.08000000000004s)]
*  embracing the socialism of Mr. Mamdani or the extremism of Mr. Trump. We need not mirror them, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=338.08s)]
*  but understand what their victories revealed, a deep frustration with politics as usual and a [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=346.47999999999996s)]
*  longing for leaders who address pitch and table concerns. Reclaiming that focus [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=353.68s)]
*  isn't just smart politics for Democrats, it's a return to our roots. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=359.03999999999996s)]
*  So, Congressman, why is it that in the Democratic Party, the three most compelling figures, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=363.52s)]
*  the mayoral candidate, Bernie Sanders and AOC, the three most compelling figures since the election [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=370.56s)]
*  have been far left of, let's say, the mainstream of a lot of Americans? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=379.52s)]
*  Why can't moderate Democrats, why can't conservative moderate Democrats like you [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=386.8s)]
*  make that same compelling message? Yeah, so let me make it clear that I [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=394.96000000000004s)]
*  disagree with Mr. Mamdani that I'm a Democratic capitalist, not a Democratic socialist. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=398.56s)]
*  But he, like I said, has tapped into, as Bernie Sanders has tapped into, this economic discontent. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=404.08000000000004s)]
*  If you ask the American people, what are the issues you care about the most, they'll say, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=410.16s)]
*  number one, the economy, number two, immigration, number three, taxes, number four, crime, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=414.08s)]
*  and number five, healthcare. If you ask those same people, what do the Democrats' agenda, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=418.64s)]
*  what's the Democrats' agenda, they'll say choice, LGBT protections, healthcare, a little bit of [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=423.76s)]
*  crossover there, protecting democracy and climate change. Those are all important issues, but that's [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=429.91999999999996s)]
*  not what everybody's talking about every night. They're talking about how am I going to pay my [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=435.28s)]
*  bills, how am I going to address the economic problems I face in my family. So we need to do [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=438.24s)]
*  a better job as Democrats talking about these kitchen table issues, these bread and butter issues [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=445.36s)]
*  about the economy. What are we going to do to raise the minimum wage? What are we going to do to build [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=451.36s)]
*  unions? What are we going to do to reassure industries in America that are going to provide [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=456.32s)]
*  jobs that people who are, whether you're a right-wing conservative or a left-wing progressive, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=460.96000000000004s)]
*  everybody in America should believe that if I'm willing to work hard in return for working hard, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=466.56s)]
*  I make enough money so I can buy a house, educate my kids, pay for health insurance, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=472.24s)]
*  and retire one day without being scared. That used to be the American dream. That's what slipped [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=477.84s)]
*  away from us. We have to propose solutions as to how we're going to get back to that place. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=482.16s)]
*  Hard work gets rewarded with a decent life. That's America, and we have to get back to that basic, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=487.44s)]
*  simple, fundamental message. Congressman, Mr. Mamdani's coalition was very young. It was a group [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=493.52s)]
*  of younger voters that turned out to cast their ballots for him. What message do you think those [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=501.68s)]
*  younger Democrats are sending to your colleagues in the Democratic Party and establishment, and how [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=508.24s)]
*  do you think the party should respond? They're saying, what about me? You know, you guys are [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=514.0799999999999s)]
*  fighting about this stuff. You're going, you're finger pointing. You're taking care of all these [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=518.3199999999999s)]
*  different—what about me? What are you doing for my life? And my life is unaffordable. I can't [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=522.88s)]
*  afford to live here. I can't afford—the rent's too damn high. You know, I can't live a good life. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=528.8s)]
*  I'm willing to work hard. I'm willing to do my share, but I want a decent life in return for that. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=535.28s)]
*  And politicians, especially in my party, Democrats, me, we have to do a better job of communicating [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=540.08s)]
*  that we see you, we hear you, and we're going to try and do things with industrial policy in America, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=546.88s)]
*  with the manufacturing policy, with all the tariff stuff, taxes, everything else. What are we going [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=554.4s)]
*  to do to build more housing that's affordable for you to make your life better? Make no mistake of [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=559.36s)]
*  it. The AI revolution that we're not about to get hit with, but is hitting right now, is already [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=566.0s)]
*  costing college kids who are graduating entry-level jobs. It's going to cost hundreds of thousands of [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=574.16s)]
*  jobs for white collar workers, for blue collar workers. I mean, this issue becomes even more [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=581.4399999999999s)]
*  complicated, and Democrats better get their arms around it. Democratic Congressman Tom Swasey of [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=588.48s)]
*  New York, thank you. Thank you. Let me just say, as a capitalist, a proud capitalist, let me just say, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=593.1999999999999s)]
*  socialism won't get it, and also unbridled, untethered capitalism won't get it either. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=602.3199999999999s)]
*  Got to be a balance. We have to have a balance. Exactly. Yeah, I get that. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftPIxPE8Axk&t=610.8s)]
