**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB8ZbhpGyKg)

*  NBC News national correspondent Aaron Gilchrist joins us from California's East Bay with more [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB8ZbhpGyKg&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  on this story. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB8ZbhpGyKg&t=21.7s)]
*  Aaron, so good to see you. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB8ZbhpGyKg&t=22.7s)]
*  Tell us please on this Memorial Day why this one is so special for this family. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB8ZbhpGyKg&t=24.36s)]
*  Well John, good morning. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB8ZbhpGyKg&t=30.32s)]
*  There are more than 80,000 American service members who are still considered missing and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB8ZbhpGyKg&t=33.0s)]
*  I'm told that the United States is the only country in the world that never stops searching [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB8ZbhpGyKg&t=37.36s)]
*  for them. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB8ZbhpGyKg&t=41.9s)]
*  Today, one soldier will finally get the dignified military funeral that he deserves. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB8ZbhpGyKg&t=42.9s)]
*  On this Memorial Day Sunday, a final tribute to one of their own. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB8ZbhpGyKg&t=52.92s)]
*  Military honor guard escorting the remains of Thomas Kelly Jr. 81 years after he died [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB8ZbhpGyKg&t=58.440000000000005s)]
*  in battle. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB8ZbhpGyKg&t=64.2s)]
*  I remember when I was six or seven years old, mom told us that she had an older brother, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB8ZbhpGyKg&t=65.2s)]
*  but he died in the war. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB8ZbhpGyKg&t=71.56s)]
*  Kelly's descendants have spent the last 12 years learning about and telling his story, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB8ZbhpGyKg&t=73.04s)]
*  one his parents rarely discussed. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB8ZbhpGyKg&t=77.68s)]
*  They didn't want us to be riddled with the grief that they had. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB8ZbhpGyKg&t=79.88s)]
*  Kelly was part of an 11-man Army Air Force crew operating in the Pacific during World [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB8ZbhpGyKg&t=83.39999999999999s)]
*  War II, flying a B-24 bomber named Heaven Can Wait. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB8ZbhpGyKg&t=87.8s)]

*  Papua New Guinea. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB8ZbhpGyKg&t=99.39999999999999s)]
*  The military searched for years after the war. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB8ZbhpGyKg&t=101.08s)]
*  The crew deemed non-recoverable, missing in action. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB8ZbhpGyKg&t=103.44s)]
*  All that came back were some personal effects and four sentences in a commander's letter [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB8ZbhpGyKg&t=107.56s)]
*  that had some vague details about the plane going down. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB8ZbhpGyKg&t=113.5s)]
*  A cousin, Scott Althaus, began to do his homework, four years collecting massive amounts of historical [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB8ZbhpGyKg&t=117.19999999999999s)]
*  records and eyewitness accounts, building a sea chart of sorts, a foundation for a new [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB8ZbhpGyKg&t=122.67999999999999s)]
*  high-tech search effort. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB8ZbhpGyKg&t=127.6s)]
*  The narrow goal was just what can we learn about how he died and maybe where he died. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB8ZbhpGyKg&t=129.51999999999998s)]
*  Kelly's family turned to Project Recover, a nonprofit that works around the globe to [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB8ZbhpGyKg&t=136.16s)]
*  search for and recover the remains of America's MIAs. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB8ZbhpGyKg&t=140.44s)]
*  Those families have sacrificed the most and they deserve their answers. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB8ZbhpGyKg&t=144.12s)]
*  We're going to do everything we can to find out what happened to their loved ones and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB8ZbhpGyKg&t=146.88s)]

*  We were reviewing data and the back end of B-24 appeared. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB8ZbhpGyKg&t=171.51999999999998s)]
*  All of us in the room knew exactly what it was and we had found it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB8ZbhpGyKg&t=177.23999999999998s)]

*  Defense POW MIA Accounting Agency could launch their own 37-day recovery mission, carefully [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB8ZbhpGyKg&t=193.48000000000002s)]
