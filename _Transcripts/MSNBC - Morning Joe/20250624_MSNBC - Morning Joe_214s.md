**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938)

*  Welcome back to morning, Joe. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=7.0600000000000005s)]
*  It's Tuesday, June 24th. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=9.16s)]
*  Jonathan Amir and Susan Page are [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  still with us. Donald Trump [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=14.0s)]
*  walking to Air Force one as he [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=16.4s)]
*  plans his trip to the Hague in [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=18.0s)]
*  the Netherlands for NATO [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=18.6s)]
*  summit. Where where most of, uh, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  the NATO countries have pledged [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=25.68s)]
*  their lives to the United [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=28.8s)]
*  States. And that's something [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=30.48s)]
*  that's been happening. The [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=32.04s)]
*  expenditures obviously something [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=33.64s)]
*  that Donald Trump has been [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=35.24s)]
*  pursuing for a very long time. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=35.84s)]
*  But Jonathan Lamir, the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=39.88s)]
*  president holding oppressive [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=42.68s)]
*  L before leaving the White [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=44.12s)]
*  House as he was going to the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=44.72s)]
*  helicopter Marine one. And very [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  angry with Israel very angry [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  with Iran saying they didn't [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=54.56s)]
*  know what to do. And he's [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=56.92s)]
*  saying, you know, we're not [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=58.120000000000005s)]
*  going to be able to get the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=59.72s)]
*  video fed into us right now, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=60.32s)]
*  but. But take us through it. He [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=64.12s)]
*  expects the ceasefire to hold [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=66.76s)]
*  and not pleased that it's not. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=68.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's been an eventful few [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=70.16s)]
*  minutes as we discussed earlier [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=71.76s)]
*  in the show. The ceasefire was [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=73.24000000000001s)]
*  agreed to President Trump [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=73.84s)]
*  trumpeting it. But you know, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=76.84s)]
*  these things are messy. It [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=78.04s)]
*  didn't end precisely at the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=79.84s)]
*  time. So yeah, it does often [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  does in apparently a missile [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=82.84s)]
*  from Iran did get through [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=84.68s)]
*  the air. But it's not a [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=86.16000000000001s)]
*  missile. It's a missile that [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  is going to hit the White House [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=89.12s)]
*  and they're saying they're [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  going to hit back with full [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=91.44s)]
*  force. And that is what is [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=92.04s)]
*  really agitated. President [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=94.68s)]
*  Trump this morning. We just [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=95.92s)]
*  showed you video. He did not [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=97.44s)]
*  talk to reporters at Joint [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=98.92s)]
*  Base Andrews, but he did a few [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=100.32000000000001s)]
*  minutes prior while leaving the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=101.28s)]
*  White House getting on Marine [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=101.88000000000001s)]
*  one as he had Sanado. Poor [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=105.36000000000001s)]
*  reports indicate a very angry [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  President Trump, as you says, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=109.36000000000001s)]
*  criticizing both countries is [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=110.76s)]
*  in Iran saying, quote, they've [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=112.56s)]
*  been fighting for so long and [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=113.84s)]

*  saying Israel do not drop those [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KccT2iQj938&t=127.0s)]
