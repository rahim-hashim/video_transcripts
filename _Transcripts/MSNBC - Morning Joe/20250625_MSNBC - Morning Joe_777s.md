# Medicaid cuts mean Democrats should be able to take back the House: Chris Matthews
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48)
*  Do you agree with the assessment from President Trump that the key nuclear enrichment facilities [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=0.0s)]
*  in Iran have been completely and totally obliterated? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=6.92s)]
*  Well I don't, I'm not sure I have, you might want to hear from Senator Cotton, who chairs [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  the Intelligence Committee, an answer on the full extent. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=17.04s)]
*  But we know for sure that their nuclear program was set back considerably and that is a victory [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=20.8s)]
*  not only for that region but for our country's national security interests. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=27.4s)]
*  Ding ding ding ding, that is the correct answer. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=30.759999999999998s)]
*  That is the correct answer by Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who said he didn't know, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=34.56s)]
*  wasn't really in his control, but that it had been set back but we're still going to [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=40.44s)]
*  figure out how much Iran's nuclear facilities were damaged by those attacks in the coming [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=46.04s)]
*  days, weeks and months. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=50.8s)]
*  Welcome back to Morning Joe. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=53.84s)]
*  It's Wednesday, June 25th, Jonathan LeMire is still with us and joining the conversation [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=55.040000000000006s)]
*  we have with staff writer at The Atlantic, Ashley Parker, and former MSNBC host Chris [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=58.92s)]
*  Matthews. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=63.080000000000005s)]
*  His sub-stack is titled Hardball with Chris Matthews. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=64.2s)]
*  So Chris, before we get to Iran, I want to talk about what the Republicans are grappling [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=69.68s)]
*  with and what happened yesterday in their closed-door meeting. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  You had Tom Tillis, who is going to be running for re-election in a state with a lot of rural [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=81.08s)]
*  counties in North Carolina, and he said, hey guys, if we continue with these Medicaid cuts, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=89.16s)]
*  then this is going to look a lot like 2008 when Barack Obama won big and Republicans [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=95.32s)]
*  got wiped out across the board. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=101.88s)]
*  Mitch McConnell responded by saying, go ahead and vote for the bill. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=104.16s)]
*  We'll get over it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=110.24s)]
*  This is a follow-up of Joni Ernst saying when people were also complaining about Medicaid [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=111.92s)]
*  cuts and how it would impact the health care of those who could afford it least, Joni Ernst [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=118.08s)]
*  said, well, people are all going to die anyway. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=123.11999999999999s)]
*  I mean, line these two things up in a 30-second commercial, and I've got to say, it is malpractice [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=125.52s)]
*  if you're a Democrat running in a competitive district and you can't piece together tax [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=131.56s)]
*  cuts for Elon Musk and billionaires in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street, those tax cuts [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=137.24s)]
*  being paid for by slashing Medicaid spending for not just blue state America, but disproportionately [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=145.84s)]
*  in red state America, in states like North Carolina. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  Talk about the impact this will have on the race next year if Republicans keep speeding [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=161.0s)]
*  towards this cliff. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=166.68s)]
*  Well, we've seen these elections going back to 1982 where the Democrats went on Social [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=168.56s)]
*  Security, Medicare, Medicaid, but now that Trump denied that he's going to cut any of [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=175.28s)]
*  these programs, we've got all over them so much tape of Trump saying, I'm not going to [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=181.24s)]
*  cut these programs, especially Medicaid, very recently, and now it looks like they're going [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=185.36s)]
*  to do it. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=190.96s)]
*  They're going to kill and take 8 million people out of the system. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=191.96s)]
*  So I think it's an easy one for Democrats to pick up the seats they need. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=195.04s)]
*  They're going to need four or five seats. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=198.51999999999998s)]
*  The history says they could win up to 30 seats in a midterm, a first midterm. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=201.07999999999998s)]
*  They've got a very good shot of getting 15 to 20 seats in a mediocre campaign. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=206.2s)]
*  They should be able to win back the House without a lot of thrill, a lot of excitement, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=211.16s)]
*  and this is easy stuff. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=215.72s)]
*  And also the threat of inflation is still out there with the tariff situation, and Trump [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=217.35999999999999s)]
*  keeps talking about it. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=222.56s)]
*  I don't know if he's going to go back to it again, but the more he talks about tariffs, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=223.72s)]
*  the more he's talking about inflation, and that was the number one issue that caused [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=227.28s)]
*  the Democrats the election. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=231.24s)]
*  It really was. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=233.64000000000001s)]
*  I'm looking for details right now on U.S. consumer confidence unexpectedly deteriorated [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=234.76s)]
*  in June as households increasingly worried about job availability, another indication [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=242.56s)]
*  that labor market conditions were softening against a backdrop of rising economic uncertainty [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=247.32s)]
*  because of the Trump administration's tariffs. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=252.04s)]
*  And this is what's so fascinating, Ashley. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=254.92s)]
*  This deterioration was across the political spectrum with the largest decline in consumer [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=258.71999999999997s)]
*  confidence among Republicans. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=265.4s)]
*  So we're rightfully talking about Iran. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=268.52s)]
*  We're rightfully talking about this bill, but lurking in the background is a growing [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=272.28s)]
*  fear by Americans of inflation kicking back in and consumer confidence right now dropping, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=276.28s)]
*  and this is impacting the approval ratings of Republican politicians. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=283.24s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it goes back to that it's always the economy's stupid, right? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=289.71999999999997s)]
*  And that what people feel, not just the actions President Biden learned well, it's not just [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=293.91999999999996s)]
*  the indicators and the metrics, but it really is those daily life things like inflation, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=301.2s)]
*  like the cost of groceries, and people care about their daily economic vibes and feels. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=307.52s)]
*  That's what the in many ways Biden's age notwithstanding the 2024 election was about. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=316.4s)]
*  You can argue a lot of things out of what we saw from the New York mayoral primary last night, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=322.96s)]
*  but one of them was that economic issues really struck a chord. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=328.64s)]
*  And so it's not surprising that this is also a national issue, even for Republicans. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=332.71999999999997s)]
*  It is. And polling suggests so many Americans are not happy with what they see coming in this [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=338.8s)]
*  legislation. And now we're but GOP trying to fast track it may not make July 4th, but trying to [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=344.08s)]
*  fast track it in the next couple of weeks. We'll return to that in a moment. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=350.15999999999997s)]
*  But now let's return back to our top story. And President Trump continues to stand by his claim [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=354.0s)]
*  that America strikes on Iran completely obliterated that country's nuclear program. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=359.12s)]
*  He made those comments earlier this morning at the NATO summits at the Hague in the Netherlands. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=365.04s)]
*  It comes as an additional assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency concludes [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=369.44s)]
*  that the bombs were not as effective as Trump claims and only set Tehran's program back by [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=374.72s)]
*  three to six months. According to Axios, though, Israeli intelligence services believe the strikes [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=380.96s)]
*  caused very significant damage to Iran's nuclear program, but they're still working on a final [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=386.32s)]
*  assessment. So, Joe, we, you know, meanwhile, actually, the Trump administration furthering [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=393.35999999999996s)]
*  this conversation is now postponing its classified briefings on the strikes for both the House and [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=399.52s)]
*  the Senate. We mentioned this earlier that these meetings were supposed to be held yesterday. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=403.91999999999996s)]
*  Now the Senate's briefing set for tomorrow. The House will get its on Friday. Three sources familiar [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=408.0s)]
*  with the changes tell NBC News the delays were to allow for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=413.6s)]
*  Secretary of State Marco Rubio to return from the NATO summit. They are there along with Trump and [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=419.04s)]
*  then come back to D.C. to attend those briefings. Top Democrats, though, expressed real frustration [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=424.96s)]
*  with the change. This last minute postponement of our briefing is outrageous. It's evasive. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=430.8s)]
*  It's derelict. They're bobbing and weaving and ducking. Senators deserve full transparency. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=438.48s)]
*  There is a legal obligation for the administration to inform Congress about [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=445.92s)]
*  precisely what is happening. What are they afraid of? Is it in fact the case [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=451.92s)]
*  that Iran's nuclear program has been completely and totally obliterated? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=458.72s)]
*  There apparently are reasons to believe that that was a blatant misrepresentation [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=465.84000000000003s)]
*  made by Donald Trump to the American people. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=473.6s)]
*  We really don't know yet. We're going to be talking to Kim Jeffries in a little bit, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=478.0s)]
*  but yeah, right now we really don't know the extent of the damage there. There has been a leak [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=481.28000000000003s)]
*  from the DIA. We've seen before leaks. Sometimes, Chris Matthews, the leaks are accurate. Sometimes [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=486.71999999999997s)]
*  the leaks are not accurate. You have one thing. You have somebody leaking something from the DIA [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=492.64s)]
*  assessment. You have the Israelis saying that it was more significant damage. You have the [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=497.12s)]
*  IAEA saying, quote, the facilities were directly impacted. And, of course, the White House saying [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=501.44s)]
*  it was completely obliterated. We don't know right now, but I have a feeling we'll have a bit of a [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=509.44s)]
*  better understanding tomorrow when Marco Rubio and Pete Hegseth testify in front of the Senate. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=514.16s)]
*  What are your thoughts? Well, look, I think the Democrats are diddling around this issue. The real [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=519.28s)]
*  issue is whether we should have struck last Friday night, and that's the big issue of the American [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=524.3199999999999s)]
*  people. Nobody wants an Ayatollah wandering around the world with a nuclear weapon. Nobody wants that [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=528.4s)]
*  reality. When I got up, a minute after I heard that story, I said, my God, we've gone from before [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=534.8s)]
*  to after, before it went on for years. We're going to stop them having that nuclear weapon. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=541.44s)]
*  We're going to do something. We're going to bunker-buster. We're going to get in there. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=549.36s)]
*  We're going 200 feet deep. And we did it. That's the big thing. They don't want to talk about that. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=552.4000000000001s)]
*  The Democrats don't want to talk about the big issue here. Should we have struck with everything [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=558.0s)]
*  we had? Should we have kept it secret as long as we did so we could do it so effectively? So it was [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=562.4000000000001s)]
*  going to be a big success for us. And I think the American people want that guy not having a nuclear [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=567.76s)]
*  weapon. And the Democrats agree with the press on this. I don't know why they don't just say, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=573.52s)]
*  we agree. We don't want the Ayatollah, this religious guy who's 86 years old, and we don't [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=578.08s)]
*  know what he's... We don't even know the guy. Having a nuclear weapon to use against probably [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=586.16s)]
*  Israel, he wants to destroy Israel. He'd probably love to destroy us. This is what he's up to. It's [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=591.6s)]
*  so clear. Democrats don't want to talk about it. But that's the issue. Do you want to strike this [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=597.52s)]
*  guy before he strikes us? And they did. And I think that's the crucial decision here. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=602.8s)]
*  This is a terrorist regime that has been saying death to America and death to Israel since 1979. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=609.36s)]
*  The overwhelming majority of Americans don't want Iran to have a nuclear program. Every president [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=618.0s)]
*  going back to Bill Clinton has said they cannot have a nuclear program. And you're right, Chris, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=625.1999999999999s)]
*  and we'll talk to Hakeem Jeffries. I'll ask Hakeem outright, is it a good thing that we struck [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=631.8399999999999s)]
*  Iran? Because it seems to me that Democrats ought to be able to do two things at once. Bill [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=638.64s)]
*  Clinton was always very good at saying, well, yeah, the Republicans got that right. Here's my concern. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=644.4799999999999s)]
*  I mean, we didn't hear enough of the Democrats saying that afterwards, saying, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=649.4399999999999s)]
*  Iran can't have a nuclear weapon. If this moves us in that direction, then this is a good thing. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=655.36s)]
*  We now want the president to come and tell us about it. You can do two things at once, Chris, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=661.68s)]
*  right? And I did not hear Democrats like you. I didn't hear enough Democrats coming out saying, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=666.56s)]
*  Iran can't have a nuclear weapon. So let's see if this is going to stop them from having a nuclear [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=674.16s)]
*  weapon. Suppose we woke up, instead of the news being we struck with everything we had, with the [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=678.96s)]
*  bunker buster, we went 200 feet deep. We really did it this time. And we kept the secrecy all along. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=685.6s)]
*  We deflected everything. We didn't meet with Israel in the Middle East talks. We sent our planes off [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=690.88s)]
*  to Guam. We did everything to avoid having this thing get out. And we did it effectively. We did [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=696.16s)]
*  something really perfect. And then you say, suppose I woke up, it was 6 o'clock Friday night, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=701.28s)]
*  and the word was out, Iran's got a nuclear weapon. They've got the ability to launch it now. They can [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=708.0799999999999s)]
*  launch it tomorrow morning, whenever they want. Do you want to live in that world? Does anybody [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=715.52s)]
*  want to live in that world? And that's the question the Dems have to answer quickly, like grownups, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=719.92s)]
*  and stop acting like they're not Americans. This is a time to say, you know what? We thought we [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=725.1999999999999s)]
*  could do it through negotiations. Obama tried to do that. We tried to do it for five years. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=730.08s)]
*  But here is a plan that will probably put it off a bit. It's never going to put it off forever. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=735.12s)]
*  But as long as the Ayatollah is around, as long as that regime is running that country, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=739.76s)]
*  do you want that regime, with its total anti-Israel attitude, to have that bomb? Do you? That's a [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=743.6s)]
*  pretty simple question. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxi_E_Dw48&t=749.84s)]
