# A $1B price tag? Why converting Qatari-owned plane for Trump could take years
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0)
*  All right, let's get to our top story this morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump is now headed to Qatar. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=2.7600000000000002s)]
*  Before boarding Air Force One, he took part in a summit with leaders from six Middle Eastern [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=4.92s)]
*  countries. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=11.4s)]
*  This was the president's last meeting in Saudi Arabia. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=12.44s)]
*  Ahead of the summit, Trump sat down with Syria's new president, and he spoke about that meeting [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=16.68s)]
*  and the decision to lift sanctions earlier this morning. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=21.56s)]
*  It gives them a chance for greatness. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=26.16s)]
*  The sanctions were really crippling, very powerful. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=28.28s)]
*  And I spoke to Mohammed and I spoke to a friend from Turkey who we just spoke to also by phone [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  now but felt very strongly that this would give them a chance. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=41.0s)]
*  It's not going to be easy anyway, so it gives them a good strong chance. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  And it was my honor to do so. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  So we will be dropping all of the sanctions on Syria, which I think really is going to [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=51.44s)]
*  be a good thing. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=57.56s)]
*  So David Ignatius, obviously a lot of questions hanging over the new leadership in Syria. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=58.56s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal cautiously optimistic, though, saying they need to be given a chance. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=63.84s)]
*  I'm curious your thoughts. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=68.2s)]
*  So Joe, after the terrible Syrian civil war, the awful loss of life, to see a chance for [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=70.64s)]
*  Syria to come back together as a country under President Amir al-Sharif is, I think, a very [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=76.7s)]
*  positive trend. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=82.88s)]
*  And lifting sanctions is a necessary part of that. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=84.44s)]
*  The big bet that President Trump and really the whole Arab world is making is that Amir [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=88.12s)]
*  al-Sharif, the president who was formerly a member of an affiliate of al-Qaeda, really [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=92.64s)]
*  has changed, that he's going to be a leader who will put his terrorist background behind [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=98.8s)]
*  him and will be able to unify the country. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  Interestingly, this is something that Israel is quite worried about, but it was pressed [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=108.4s)]
*  by Turkey, which has been the biggest backer of al-Sharif, encouraged to help train his [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=113.84s)]
*  forces before he took power. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=120.52s)]
*  So it's a big move by President Trump. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=123.18s)]
*  We were all expecting that this trip to Saudi Arabia would be pop and, you know, elaborate [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=125.52s)]
*  meetings. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=131.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=134.68s)]
*  And it's been that, but it's also had a lot of substance. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=135.68s)]
*  I was going to say, we obviously, for good reason, a lot of people are talking about [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=138.8s)]
*  the jet, the Qatari jet, possibility of corruption, the possibility of, again, I think for most [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=143.92000000000002s)]
*  Republicans who are critical of it, the possibility of espionage. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=151.16000000000003s)]
*  So we are talking about that. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=155.44s)]
*  It's important, too. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=158.4s)]
*  It's also important, though, not to miss actually the policy that's happening over there right [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=159.4s)]
*  now that may have quite a substantial impact, whether you're talking about Syria, whether [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=164.22s)]
*  you're talking about Iran. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=168.02s)]
*  I am curious, though, and I think more one of the more intriguing storylines that we've [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=170.06s)]
*  talked about already coming out of this summit is the distancing of Donald Trump from Bibi [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=176.7s)]
*  Netanyahu. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=181.82s)]
*  And we saw it yet again yesterday with the Syria decision, didn't we? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=183.14s)]
*  We did. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=187.94s)]
*  There was a symbolism to Trump's first extended trip to the Middle East, going to Saudi Arabia, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=189.42s)]
*  which seems to be the center of U.S. interest, rather than Israel. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=197.02s)]
*  Traditionally, the anchor for American policy in the region, we'll have to see how long [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=202.5s)]
*  that lasts. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=207.57999999999998s)]
*  I don't see any real weakening of the U.S. commitment to Israel's security. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=208.57999999999998s)]
*  But the United States is doing things that make Israel nervous. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=213.34s)]
*  And I think that's only beginning to play out. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=217.82s)]
*  It's going to be a big debate in coming weeks. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=220.26s)]
*  And, Katty, now the president moves on. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=222.5s)]
*  In a short time from now, he'll arrive in Qatar for the second leg of this three-stop [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=224.1s)]
*  tour, expected to get the same lavish royal welcome that he got in Saudi Arabia, including [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=228.5s)]
*  discussions about that $400 million plane. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=233.98s)]
*  Yeah, the plane is the one that's going to dog him when he's in Qatar. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=237.22s)]
*  He's doubled down on why he would be a fool not to take a plane like this. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=242.22s)]
*  Somebody else can pay for it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=247.54000000000002s)]
*  But it's been striking up on the Hill, you know, much closer to home, where we're all [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=248.94s)]
*  sitting right now, just how many Republicans are feeling a little queasy about this and [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=253.06s)]
*  are prepared to say so publicly. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=257.66s)]
*  I mean, you've got even somebody like Josh Hawley saying this may not be the best idea. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=259.1s)]
*  Why don't we get a plane that's built in the United States? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=262.58s)]
*  The security implications of having a plane that the Qataris are given, the conflict of [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=266.06s)]
*  interest questions that might arise about American policy towards Qatar if Qatar gives [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=271.62s)]
*  this plane. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=277.14s)]
*  But for the moment, the president reiterating on his truth social posts that this is what [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=278.22s)]
*  he wants. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=283.5s)]
*  I'm trying to figure out, is this another sort of in the signal and noise bracket of [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=285.06s)]
*  the Trump administration? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=289.22s)]
*  Is this signal or is this noise? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=290.86s)]
*  Is this a distraction from something else? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=292.84000000000003s)]
*  Perhaps the distancing from Israel that may not go down so well on the Hill that David [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=294.94s)]
*  is talking about. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=300.74s)]
*  I'm still trying to work that one out for the moment. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=301.74s)]
*  He's doubling down on it, but it's going to be in focus in Qatar. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=304.58s)]
*  And clearly some of the Republicans not happy about it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=307.3s)]
*  Well, you know, that's a question that we've been asking. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=309.18s)]
*  Is this one of those things that again, is it signal? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=311.18s)]
*  Is it noise? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=314.21999999999997s)]
*  Is it is it noise to distract from something else? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=315.21999999999997s)]
*  Because especially when you consider Republicans are against the Wall Street Journal editorial [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=318.02s)]
*  page, National Journal, National Review, so many conservatives, some of the most conservatives [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=322.21999999999997s)]
*  against it. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=327.58s)]
*  Also, of course, the intel community very concerned about the espionage threats there. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=328.9s)]
*  It's just so again, that is that is the question that again, is caddy asked, is this signal? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=333.7s)]
*  Is this noise? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=340.65999999999997s)]
*  Is this something that at the end he knows he's not going to be able to accept? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=341.65999999999997s)]
*  It may be one issue, whether it's a trolling noise or not, where Republicans find their [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=344.65999999999997s)]
*  voice a bit. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=350.21999999999997s)]
*  Here they are talking about the plane. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=351.21999999999997s)]
*  This is a hypothetical, and I'm sure that if and when there is it, it's no longer a [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=352.58s)]
*  hypothetical. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=360.41999999999996s)]
*  I can assure you there will be plenty of scrutiny of whatever that arrangement might look like. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=361.62s)]
*  I'm concerned with the national security implications of that being given as a gift to the president. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=366.5s)]
*  Well, again, I mean, I just said there'll be plenty of scrutiny. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=373.5s)]
*  There are lots of lots of issues around that that I think will attract very serious questions [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=376.02s)]
*  if and when it happens. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=380.98s)]
*  Well, the only thing I'm concerned is the safety of the president. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=381.98s)]
*  I mean, Qatar is not, in my opinion, a great ally. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=385.58s)]
*  I mean, they support Hamas, and so what I'm worried about is the safety of the president [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=388.46s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=392.46s)]
*  I mean, I'm a little concerned about accepting a gift from the federal government that way. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=393.46s)]
*  I mean, it's a very odd offer. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=398.26s)]
*  Obviously, people just don't give you things without expecting something in return. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=400.38s)]
*  And, you know, Qatar may be useful, but I wouldn't say that they're our strongest ally. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=405.46s)]
*  When you get something of that value from a country, one typically thinks that there's [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=410.66s)]
*  something in it for the country that is offering it. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=416.66s)]
*  So I think there's certainly a lot of questions. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=420.66s)]
*  I think we should have a big, beautiful plane built in the United States of America. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=423.66s)]
*  The president's been very good on make America buy America. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=429.66s)]
*  We probably ought to pass a law that requires the federal government to buy everything from [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=433.66s)]
*  it in the United States of America. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=437.66s)]
*  I think this would be a good opportunity to do that. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=438.66s)]
*  And I can think of other things, but the president can too, that Qatar can do to be helpful to us. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=440.66s)]
*  If they'd like to be helpful, they could start by rooting out the Islamic radicalist terrorists. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=444.66s)]
*  That they fund, that they fund, whether it's Hezbollah, whether it's Hamas, whether it's Islamic Jihad, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=450.66s)]
*  we can go down the list, but, Elizabeth, there's so many things that Republicans would naturally be against here [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=459.66s)]
*  in any normal times, and we're starting to hear actually some of it. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=465.66s)]
*  You know, one is the fact that Hamas has been supported by Qatar for years now, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=469.66s)]
*  and every other anti-Israeli terrorist group has been as well. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=476.66s)]
*  So there's that problem. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=481.66s)]
*  There's a problem of getting Air Force One, potential Air Force One from any country, any country. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=482.66s)]
*  This would be a problem if we were coming from France, let alone Qatar. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=490.66s)]
*  And then finally, as Josh Hawley said there, the presidency and the Republican Party that is so dedicated to buying America, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=495.66s)]
*  building America, at least they say they are, actually not even having the president fly around in a plane [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=511.66s)]
*  built by Americans. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=518.66s)]
*  Well, you know, can you imagine if this was Barack Obama wanting to accept the $400 million plane from Qatar? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=521.66s)]
*  And it just shows you how things have changed. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=529.66s)]
*  I mean, you know, Democratic presidents and their aides have talked about going to Riyadh [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=533.66s)]
*  and going into the rooms and finding literally briefcases of jewels, of diamonds and emeralds and rubies. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=540.66s)]
*  And the first thing they did was they turned them over to the person at the State Department so they would not accept them. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=547.66s)]
*  It just shows you how things have changed under Donald Trump and with his selling his meme coin. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=553.66s)]
*  Listen, the trip to Saudi Arabia was the first day was focused largely on business deals, on commercial diplomacy, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=560.66s)]
*  not just diplomatic diplomacy. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=568.66s)]
*  And I think that there are so many problems here. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=571.66s)]
*  One of them is certainly is the cost of retrofitting the plane. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=574.66s)]
*  Basically, people have said you have to take the whole thing apart and build it again because you have to look for all of the bugging devices. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=578.66s)]
*  It clearly will be in, I mean, no country would, it's unimaginable that this wouldn't be a problem. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=585.66s)]
*  So it just shows how things have changed. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=591.66s)]
*  And I love that the majority leader, John Thune, is saying that, well, you know, it's still a hypothetical, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=593.66s)]
*  not exactly a stirring opposition there from John Thune. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=600.66s)]
*  And to the point about the security concerns, aviation experts tell NBC News that it will cost a billion dollars to retrofit the plane, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=606.66s)]
*  to give all the things you would need for a president to fly in it safely. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=615.66s)]
*  And it may not even be finished before the end of Donald Trump's second term here. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=618.66s)]
*  So may not ever end up being Air Force One. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=623.66s)]
*  Might be something you could use later on. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=625.66s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=627.66s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvZIaJx-q0&t=648.66s)]
