# 'Unlawful power grab': California AG sues Trump over National Guard order
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo)
*  For more on this, California's got a new lawsuit against the Trump administration over the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=0.0s)]
*  deployment of National Guard troops in Los Angeles. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=5.64s)]
*  Let's bring in California Attorney General Rob Bonta. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=9.44s)]
*  Mr. Attorney General, what exactly are you stating in this suit, and how effective do [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  you think it can be at a moment like this? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=19.84s)]
*  Well, thank you for having me this morning. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=22.96s)]
*  The Trump administration is involved in an unlawful power grab that is dangerous and [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=27.32s)]
*  reckless, that threatens to inflame and provoke the tensions and to make things worse, and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=33.160000000000004s)]
*  is counterproductive. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=42.56s)]
*  And, by the way, it's also unlawful for the president to call in the National Guard, trying [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=43.56s)]
*  to usurp and override the authority of the actual commander-in-chief of the California [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=49.64s)]
*  Governor Gavin Newsom. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=55.28s)]
*  The president relies on a statute that does not give him the authority to call in the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=57.08s)]
*  National Guard. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=61.44s)]
*  It requires cooperation by the governor, which he does not have. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=62.44s)]
*  It requires the existence of an invasion or a rebellion or the inability to execute the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=64.8s)]
*  federal law, none of which are present. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=71.48s)]
*  So we've asked the court to invalidate his calling in and deployment of the National [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=73.4s)]
*  Guard. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=79.0s)]
*  These are hardworking men and women, patriots who want to serve their country. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=80.16s)]
*  They are political pawns, unfortunately, who are being disrespected and manipulated by [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=84.92s)]
*  the president. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=89.44s)]
*  And it is wrong, it is dangerous, and yes, it's unlawful as well. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=90.44s)]
*  So, Mara, there's been many who have expressed concern. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  This is almost like a dry run for President Trump deploying the military on American streets, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=97.08s)]
*  that there'll be other reasons, perhaps even the midterm elections, in which he might do [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=102.72s)]
*  that again. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=106.16s)]
*  Just focusing on the here and now, there are real concerns here that the presence of these [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=108.16s)]
*  military officers that we've been hearing all morning long and all week long is that [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=111.75999999999999s)]
*  they're the ones actually, whether they mean to or not, they're the ones provoking a lot [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=116.16s)]
*  of the tension, provoking the response, because it is so unsettling to see heavily armed members [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  of the military on the streets of an American city. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=125.67999999999999s)]
*  Well, this isn't just an escalation. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=127.84s)]
*  This is the president of the United States inventing a crisis that then allows him to [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=129.92s)]
*  put military force on the streets of an American city. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=137.08s)]
*  And it's a test of not only our legal system, but of how Americans and governors, state [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=142.0s)]
*  attorneys general, and just ordinary people are going to respond, whether we respond or [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=150.32000000000002s)]
*  not. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=157.68s)]
*  You know, the executive memorandum that the White House laid out on Saturday also was [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=159.72000000000003s)]
*  disturbing because it not only cited violence from protesters, which has been minimal, by [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=164.04s)]
*  the way, as a grounds to use troops on the ground, but also any action that inhibits [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=171.12s)]
*  law enforcement, which is extraordinarily broad. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=178.76s)]
*  So I think this is a test case for what we might see sadly, and I hope not, in other [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=181.2s)]
*  American states and cities. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=187.72s)]
*  This isn't just about California. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=190.12s)]
*  California is first because obviously this is a state run by Democrats and it provides [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=191.84s)]
*  the kind of political theater that Donald Trump wants. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=197.64s)]
*  We have black, brown and white Americans protesting out in streets, flags from different countries, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=200.4s)]
*  as well as this country. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=207.98s)]
*  And that is exactly the theater that the president wants. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=209.88s)]
*  It's actually not clear what legal grounds he's using since he hasn't invoked the Insurrection [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=213.06s)]
*  Act under the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 that limits the use of troops on American [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=218.39999999999998s)]
*  soil. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=226.95999999999998s)]
*  And so, you know, then I think there's just a tragedy of having Americans who have signed [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=228.48s)]
*  up to serve the military to protect this country, who took an oath to the Constitution, actually [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=233.88s)]
*  being brought on the streets to police other Americans. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=240.67999999999998s)]
*  The second battalion, seventh Marines, was the same unit that was in Okinawa. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=244.98s)]
*  This is not how these troops are supposed to be used. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=250.1s)]
*  And it is devastating for everybody. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=253.06s)]
*  So Mr. Attorney General, let's get your reaction to this idea of what you're seeing now on [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=257.02s)]
*  the streets, but also your fears, what may be to come in the days ahead as more troops [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=261.58s)]
*  arrive potentially. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=266.3s)]
*  The president has, you know, taken, he posted on social just a few moments ago saying this [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=267.9s)]
*  was the right thing to do, and he criticized local leaders for not doing more. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=272.74s)]
*  He doesn't seem to be backing down. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=277.66s)]
*  Yeah, you know, this is a manufactured crisis, an artificial controversy, and that's what [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=280.06s)]
*  the president wants. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=286.90000000000003s)]
*  Unfortunately, he wants the confusion, he wants the chaos. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=287.90000000000003s)]
*  It seems that he wants things to explode, because that will give him the excuse that [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=290.82s)]
*  he wants to try to seize more power, which is his MO. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=296.14s)]
*  Besides having a very complicated relationship with the truth and being a hypocrite, he [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=298.94s)]
*  has an ongoing mission to seize more power that is not his, and we will not allow that. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=305.86s)]
*  We think it's very important that protesters continue to be peaceful, safe, lawful. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=312.42s)]
*  The super majority of those involved have been exactly that. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=319.02s)]
*  Unfortunately, when you see peaceful protests, you also see folks who participate and see [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=322.14s)]
*  this opportunistically and use the peaceful protest as a cloak for their criminal actions. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=327.14s)]
*  And that is unfortunate. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=332.02s)]
*  Those people must be arrested and held accountable for any criminal activity. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=333.02s)]
*  They are undermining the democratic expression of the First Amendment by those who are peacefully [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=338.21999999999997s)]
*  protesting. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=344.9s)]
*  But I have encouraged and I continue to encourage and I will encourage again now all of those [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=345.9s)]
*  who are not happy with their government, who want to lift up their voices to do so, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=349.9s)]
*  consistent with their First Amendment, but do so peacefully only, safely only, and lawfully [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=357.06s)]
*  only. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=362.34s)]
*  That is absolutely critical as we move forward. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=363.34s)]
*  But this is a president who we have sued 25 times in 20 weeks, more than once a week, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=365.82s)]
*  because that's how blatantly, brazenly, consistently and frequently he has broken the law. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=372.26s)]
*  He's broken the law again here. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=376.26s)]
*  He does not have the authority to call in the National Guard. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=377.70000000000005s)]
*  He is trying to provoke, inflame and escalate. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=380.46000000000004s)]
*  And in California, we want peace and calm. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=384.14000000000004s)]
*  That's what we're asking for. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=386.94s)]
*  And that's what we're going to accomplish. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=388.42s)]
*  You mentioned, Mr. Attorney General, the many different lawsuits. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=391.34000000000003s)]
*  Are they not effective? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=395.42s)]
*  And in terms of this suit that's been filed, what's next in the legal process? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=397.42s)]
*  And how important is it that this lawsuit is successful? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=402.94000000000005s)]
*  Our lawsuits have been very successful. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=408.62s)]
*  We bring cases based on the facts in the law. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=411.70000000000005s)]
*  If all we have is political grievance or ideological or policy difference, we can't sue and we [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=413.90000000000003s)]
*  won't sue. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=418.5s)]
*  A court will throw us out. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=419.5s)]
*  When there have been orders issued in our cases, we have largely secured restraining [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=421.46000000000004s)]
*  orders and preliminary injunctions in which the court says, you're likely to win this [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=426.18s)]
*  case. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=429.42s)]
*  You're right on the merits. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=430.42s)]
*  And something like the president trying to rewrite the Constitution with a stroke of [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=431.58000000000004s)]
*  the pen on day one, trying to revoke birthright citizenship, a time honored and Supreme Court [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=435.22s)]
*  supported constitutional right is obviously something he can't do. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=442.14000000000004s)]
*  He acts unlawfully and he does it blatantly. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=445.90000000000003s)]
*  It's very important that we win this case, that we show that the president's authority [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=448.94000000000005s)]
*  does not exist here and that he's trying to use power that he does not have and that belongs [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=454.54s)]
*  to the governor of California, not to the president. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=459.3s)]
*  We believe that a court will find that. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=462.46000000000004s)]
*  Our case is strong and we hope to get an order in short order declaring that. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=465.14000000000004s)]
*  And I think when it's clear that the governor is in charge here and not the president and [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=471.22s)]
*  the president has no statutory authority here, we'll get back to keeping the peace with the [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=475.94s)]
*  sheriff's department of Los Angeles, the largest sheriff's department in the nation, the LAPD, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=480.70000000000005s)]
*  the third largest police department in the nation, who within their own resources and [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=484.98s)]
*  any mutual aid have things well under control and can avoid the escalation and provocation [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=488.88s)]
*  that the president through his unlawful insertion into this into the events here in L.A. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=496.84s)]
*  has caused. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=502.64s)]
*  Mr. Attorney General, on a separate topic, another one actually that the White House feels [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=503.88s)]
*  like is politically beneficial to them. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=507.56s)]
*  California sued the U.S. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=511.24s)]
*  Department of Justice yesterday over its demand that local school districts ban transgender [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=512.96s)]
*  youth from competing in sports. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=518.36s)]
*  We see the headline there from the L.A. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=520.6800000000001s)]
*  Times. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=522.72s)]
*  Walk us through the rationale for this lawsuit. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=523.72s)]
*  Why is it important for your state? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=527.48s)]
*  Well, it's important not just for our state. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=530.76s)]
*  It's important for rights and freedoms that the Constitution gives, that statutes give [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=535.2s)]
*  to Americans. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=543.36s)]
*  And the president and the presidential administration have a very difficult relationship with the [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=545.52s)]
*  law. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=551.64s)]
*  The president has said, I'm not an attorney, and that couldn't be more clear. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=552.64s)]
*  His grasp of the law is very poor. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=555.64s)]
*  And he has demanded that we violate the constitutional rights and the statutory protections of Californians [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=560.46s)]
*  in this demand. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=568.1999999999999s)]
*  And that's something we will not do. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=569.1999999999999s)]
*  We refuse to do. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=570.72s)]
*  defend the rights, the freedoms of Californians, including transgender Californians. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=573.2s)]
*  We will not discriminate against them. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=579.6s)]
*  We will follow the law. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=581.08s)]
*  That's our North Star. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=582.08s)]
*  And if necessary, as is necessary here, we'll go to court to vindicate those rights and [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=583.6400000000001s)]
*  protect those freedoms for Californians who deserve that protection. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=589.88s)]
*  California Attorney General Raban, thank you so much for joining us this morning at a certainly [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=594.2s)]
*  very busy time for your office and your state. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=598.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=601.8s)]
*  Certainly. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=602.8s)]
*  We know here that the president of the United States made this issue a significant one during [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=603.8s)]
*  his reelection campaign last year, successfully so. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=608.84s)]
*  But we've heard from the Attorney General, other Democrats, that it's simply about preserving [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=612.68s)]
*  someone's rights. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=615.52s)]
*  And this is not a topic going away anytime soon. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNNbp9pUYo&t=617.24s)]
