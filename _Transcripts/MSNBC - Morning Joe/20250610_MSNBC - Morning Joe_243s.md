**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU)
*  And officials in Washington are stepping up security ahead of Saturday's celebration marking the founding of the United States Army [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU&t=0.0s)]
*  250 years ago [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU&t=8.56s)]
*  Thousands of people are expected to attend a massive military parade and festival along the National Mall [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU&t=10.16s)]
*  Battle tanks and fighting vehicles are being shipped to the nation's capital by the dozen the event coincides with President Trump's [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU&t=16.2s)]
*  79th birthday on Saturday and will cost up to [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU&t=23.6s)]
*  $45 million some streets around Washington will be closed for four days [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU&t=27.04s)]
*  General hurtling so Saturday is the 250th anniversary the birthday of the United States Army a day of course worthy of [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU&t=33.56s)]
*  Celebration I remember your friend in ours Jack Jacobs [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU&t=41.4s)]
*  Colonel Jacobs the Medal of Honor recipient saying we're not at tanks in the street country saying that over the years in the past [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  But on Saturday, we will be how are you feeling about it? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU&t=52.2s)]
*  Well the 250th Willie for the audience is it's a critical event for the US Army [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU&t=55.84s)]
*  It's not only 250 years, but that coincides with a year before our country was declared a nation [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU&t=62.32s)]
*  So our army is older than our country [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU&t=69.04s)]
*  It was originally the Continental Army and I agree with Colonel Jacobs that I'm all for [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU&t=71.52000000000001s)]
*  Celebrating soldiers and there's going to be a lot of soldiers at this parade. I'm personally truth [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU&t=76.88s)]
*  Truth be told I'm not a parade kind of guy to be honest [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU&t=82.88000000000001s)]
*  I hate parades even when I was a cadet at West Point, but this is an indication of mission creep [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU&t=86.16000000000001s)]
*  foisted upon the army by I think by the politicians because what we're seeing is [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  An event that was going to be static displays at the mall soldiers marching [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  Downtown town has now been turned into a very high profile event [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU&t=104.44s)]
*  And as you see as you're going over all those vehicles, you know, Mike Barnacle asked before how much is this gonna cost? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU&t=109.24s)]
*  It's gonna cost a lot. Not only are those vehicles used a lot [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU&t=114.6s)]
*  Have they been transported from different military bases? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU&t=118.72s)]
*  But as you can see looking at those tanks and Bradleys that you're showing right now, they've all been freshly painted [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU&t=122.32s)]
*  the last time a per you know a [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU&t=128.12s)]
*  Bunch of tanks were brought to Washington DC. It was at a last-minute time frame and it they look bad [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU&t=130.64s)]
*  I mean they were not a good reflection of the army [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU&t=137.84s)]
*  so obviously the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU&t=140.24s)]
*  commanders and the soldiers who take a great deal of pride in their vehicles want them to be looking well and you know this that's [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU&t=141.52s)]
*  created a [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU&t=148.24s)]
*  more cost other than the train load and the rail head and the helicopters are going to be flying overhead and the and the fuel that's [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU&t=149.2s)]
*  Going to be used and the support for the almost 8,000 soldiers that are going to be marching [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU&t=156.72s)]
*  inside of that column with the other vehicles to represent [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU&t=161.76s)]
*  Wars that the nation has fought in in different period dress and uniforms [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU&t=166.35999999999999s)]
*  It was a good idea by the army to celebrate this and use it as a recruiting tool. It's just been [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU&t=170.48s)]
*  Generate it's generated a lot more interest because of the connection with the president's birthday. That's for sure [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU&t=177.16s)]
*  Yeah, and updated estimates on cost 50 60 million dollars [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU&t=183.68s)]
*  Perhaps more than that because of the streets of Washington likely gonna need to be repaved and fixed because these tanks of course [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU&t=187.44s)]
*  Are so heavy and we should you know, certainly this comes and we get just days after [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU&t=193.84s)]
*  You know where we're amid what we're seeing in Los Angeles about American troops there [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU&t=199.32s)]
*  I think that's triggering for a lot of people and we've reported on this last week [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU&t=202.76s)]
*  But we it's worth repeating that the army is not the only branch of service celebrating a 250th birthday this year [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU&t=206.46s)]
*  The Navy is doing so in October the Marines in November [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU&t=211.52s)]
*  But neither of them are getting a parade in Washington only the army only because its birthday coincides with that of President Trump [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU&t=215.16s)]
*  You [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LoyOhju_mU&t=223.44s)]
