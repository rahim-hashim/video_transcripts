# Trump rattles markets ahead of opening with posts on tariffs against EU and Apple
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM)
*  Start this hour with two social media posts from President Trump came out a few hours ago and are [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=0.0s)]
*  Rattling the markets before the opening bell Trump now threatening 25 percent tariffs on Apple for [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=6.8s)]
*  Manufacturing its iPhones overseas. He's also recommending recommending a straight [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=13.64s)]
*  50% tariff on the European Union starting on June 1st. That's a that's a week from Sunday [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=18.84s)]
*  After complaining the trade negotiations with the EU have stalled [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=25.28s)]
*  The reaction from Wall Street has been swift and negative with Dow futures tumbling nearly 500 points [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=29.66s)]
*  While the S&P and Nasdaq are seeing significant losses as well mark Leibovich [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=36.260000000000005s)]
*  It seems like President Trump can't leave well enough alone here when he first declared these tariffs on his so-called [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=42.980000000000004s)]
*  Liberation day we saw the markets really take a hit he backed off hit pause [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=49.900000000000006s)]
*  One trade deal one trade deal only with the UK [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=55.940000000000005s)]
*  But it seems like things that stabilized the markets and more or less made back what they lost [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=58.86s)]
*  But now he's seemingly going for another round [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=62.940000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, and it's unclear what triggered this but this all feels very much [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=66.42s)]
*  You know the middle of April news cycle called back [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=70.22s)]
*  They want it so they want its narrative back or whatever you want to call it [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=73.46000000000001s)]
*  I mean, I mean the bigger picture here is if you're running a business or if you're trying to run an economy or run [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=76.54s)]
*  A country. I mean, this is I mean, how do you plan for this? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=80.98s)]
*  I mean if it's clear at this point or it looks at this point like the US sort of fiscal and [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=83.22s)]
*  Economic and trade policy is being run on the winds of a single person [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=90.5s)]
*  Which is I think something that the Trump certainly likes and likes the prerogative of but yeah [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=94.66s)]
*  It's unsettling and you know people a lot of smarter people than me have tried and probably failed to figure out [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=99.61999999999999s)]
*  What is driving this and what is driving his decision-making and communication strategy here Dave Weigel a Republican texted me [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=105.66s)]
*  A few moments ago sort of half kidding perhaps but speculating that Trump you're feeling overconfident his bill got through the house [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=112.58s)]
*  He's feeling good. So he felt like he had momentum here to reignite his trade war [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=119.78s)]
*  That makes sense to me that theory makes sense to me Republicans are full of Brio this week [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=126.9s)]
*  They celebrated multiple times after after getting their bill through through the house [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=131.46s)]
*  No, it makes perfect sense that Trump would look at that environment [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=135.98000000000002s)]
*  The aftermath and and look at not just thought the bond markets [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=139.38000000000002s)]
*  Let's leave those aside but other investors and how they've reacted his reversals [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=142.98000000000002s)]
*  So if he if he thinks that a lot of investors have gotten used to him [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=146.5s)]
*  Threatening tariffs and then rolling them back and they can keep investing with that with that [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=151.62s)]
*  Semi certainty then he's kind of right [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=156.26000000000002s)]
*  He's he's been testing the bound bounds of this and what's what's been the cost to him? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=158.8s)]
*  But some money lost about five points in the polls [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=162.42000000000002s)]
*  He's still in better shape than he was at this point eight years ago [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=165.3s)]
*  You can understand why he has some confidence or overconfidence [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=167.57999999999998s)]
*  Yeah [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=170.98s)]
*  Clearly socializing people to the fact that the only constant is going to be him continuing to stoke uncertainty [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=171.38s)]
*  Yeah this trade war. I also think John Lemire [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=177.01999999999998s)]
*  There's an interesting opportunity here for us to look at the different ways that [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=179.94s)]
*  Trump is going to contend with these various heads of private organizations [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=183.98s)]
*  We saw for example the call to Jeff Bezos when Amazon weighed potentially putting [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=188.68s)]
*  Tariff increased prices on their websites for some of their cheaper goods to show people the impact of tariffs and the trade war [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=193.82s)]
*  But now we're also seeing him threatening Tim Cook and telling them that unless they see the iPhone parts actually [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=200.29999999999998s)]
*  Manufactured here that they are going to face steeper tariffs [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=206.85999999999999s)]
*  And of course the concerns around the cost of an iPhone were immediate when these trade deals and trade tariffs were initially announced [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=210.26s)]
*  So an interesting case study as we start to see that stories continue to unfold too [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=217.26s)]
*  And we have the perfect person joining us now to help explain it co-anchor of CNBC's squawk box in the New York Times columnist [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=221.54s)]
*  Andrew Ross Sorkin sir Andrew the markets reacting as we just noted [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=228.29999999999998s)]
*  Poorly to these posts from the president. Let's do one at a time first the Apple thing as Ali just mentioned [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=232.14s)]
*  I mean, this is pretty extraordinary [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=237.66s)]
*  You know, this is not usually how Denmark democracies and capitalism works the government saying [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=239.82s)]
*  Hey, you've got to do it this way or we're gonna use the levers of power to make your life really difficult [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=247.14000000000001s)]
*  Well, let's break apart a couple things on the Apple story here [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=254.46s)]
*  First of all, at least my understanding and I think it's everybody's understanding you can't just tariff one company directly [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=257.46000000000004s)]
*  You can't just put a tariff a 25% tariff as the president has described on Apple specifically [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=266.02s)]
*  You put tariffs on countries. That's how this works [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=272.38s)]
*  So invariably if you start to try to sort of unwind what this really means [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=275.42s)]
*  there's the possibility that [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=282.54s)]
*  Anything coming from frankly India or China [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=285.58s)]
*  Would have to have a minimum of a 25% tariff on it because that would be the only way that you could tariff Apple at these [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=289.22s)]
*  Levels it also means that it would have an impact on every other product coming out of India or China [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=295.94s)]
*  And right now there had been the expectation that there would be a lot lower tariffs at least coming out of a place like India [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=301.78s)]
*  So we can think about that. There's the other [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=308.42s)]
*  component part of this which is that the president has been quite vociferous about condemning the EU other countries about their [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=311.3s)]
*  regulations and critiques of American companies for a very long time [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=320.09999999999997s)]
*  They have said the EU and China and other countries have done a disservice [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=323.86s)]
*  To American businesses by trying to regulate them by trying to criticize them [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=328.97999999999996s)]
*  So it's very interesting to see here the president of the United States [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=333.41999999999996s)]
*  Criticizing one of the most iconic American companies in the world [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=337.82s)]
*  Of course having just met by the way with Tim Cook in the Oval Office [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=341.26s)]
*  Earlier this week and Tim Cook at least historically had been seen as somebody who had threaded a needle [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=346.61999999999995s)]
*  With President Trump over these past several years [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=352.26s)]
*  The president came out and made a public comment about Tim Cook and Apple recently this appears to be a doubling down on that [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=355.74s)]
*  So the real question now at least the way the markets are concerning is what again is the off-ramp? Is there an off-ramp? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=362.21999999999997s)]
*  What does Apple have to offer her? What is Tim Cook willing to offer? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=368.21999999999997s)]
*  What is the president willing to accept and I think there is some kind of bargain that will eventually be made the question is when? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=372.82s)]
*  And what does that ultimately look like? So Andrew let's turn to the EU [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=379.54s)]
*  Post this morning now where I mean there seemed to have been this sense like oh the trade war is over [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=383.72s)]
*  But this is a reminder it is not these were just pauses pauses [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=388.62s)]
*  You know the only deal that got done was the UK although frankly Trump also complaining about that today in a post suggesting [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=392.52000000000004s)]
*  They need to be doing more with energy prices [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=398.36s)]
*  And now but this is a this is all temporary he could he could [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=400.36s)]
*  Bring back and even [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=404.88s)]
*  Increase the tariffs on these countries. I mean business leaders are talking to you're talking to you must just be dismayed about [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=407.0s)]
*  the the inconsistency [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=413.6s)]
*  It's well it creates an enormous about a volatility to some degree you could say you now know where the floor and the ceiling is [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=415.16s)]
*  On the way the markets think about this right when it seems like there are no tariffs the markets up clear to up to [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=421.36s)]
*  6,000 then at the bottom end is closer to 5,000 and maybe when it gets high [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=427.32000000000005s)]
*  The president feels like he has leverage [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=433.52000000000004s)]
*  And is willing to let things move around a little bit as he tries to make these negotiations happen [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=435.88s)]
*  But I think the bigger point is to any extent that the market investors [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=442.4s)]
*  Policymakers around the world have thought that we are close at hand to a deal [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=447.96s)]
*  Which is something we've been told repeatedly at least in the context of the EU [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=452.67999999999995s)]
*  We are not and he said very emphatically and specifically that there are not that these negotiations aren't close [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=457.59999999999997s)]
*  We still haven't heard from India [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=465.12s)]
*  We still haven't heard from Japan South Korea all of the things that we've been told we were getting closer to now [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=466.91999999999996s)]
*  It may very well be we'll wake up on Monday, and there'll be deals [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=472.0s)]
*  But I just think we have to look at all of this with a bit of skepticism about how quickly any deal deals [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=474.56s)]
*  Will ultimately be reached? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=481.52s)]
*  You [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoOg2SSzmXM&t=502.0s)]
