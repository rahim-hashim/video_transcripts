# 'Have we no shame?': Reagan-appointed judge fast-tracks cases against Trump’s executive orders
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM)
*  Reagan-appointed senior judge William Young has a 40-year career presiding over some of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=0.0s)]
*  the country's highest-profile cases. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=5.68s)]
*  New reporting from the New York Times takes a look at how the 84-year-old is fast-tracking [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=8.08s)]
*  all the cases against Trump's executive orders that he can, but in a way that, quote, recalls [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=13.76s)]
*  a time when mutual respect and deference to the law were more standard in relations between [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=19.0s)]
*  the executive and judicial branches. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=25.04s)]
*  Let's bring in former state attorney for Palm Beach County, Florida, Dave Ahrenberg. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=27.88s)]
*  Dave, thanks for joining us. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=31.84s)]
*  Talk a little bit about this judge and the tact he's taken to these cases and why it [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=33.96s)]
*  stands out and deserves a New York Times write-up. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=38.84s)]
*  Sam, Judge Young is no left-wing antifa judge. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=41.04s)]
*  He's a Reagan appointee. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=45.76s)]
*  He was an Army veteran. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=48.2s)]
*  He's someone who's well-respected, and he's just upset about what's going on, clearly [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  through his words. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=54.64s)]
*  He is taking on the Trump administration and is putting his foot on the pedal. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=55.76s)]
*  Unlike other judges, like Judge Aileen Cannon, who seemed to delay, delay, delay, paralysis [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=60.72s)]
*  by analysis, this judge wants to go and put things on the trial docket. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=65.52s)]
*  And he's not afraid to speak his mind. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=71.2s)]
*  It really upsets the Trump administration. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=73.68s)]
*  They're really furious at the fact that he has made these statements. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=76.8s)]
*  It sounds like Joseph Welch, the Boston lawyer who took on Joseph McCarthy. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=79.72s)]
*  Have you no decency? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  This judge says, have we no shame? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=86.88s)]
*  And so this is why the Trump administration is so upset. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=89.32000000000001s)]
*  They don't like activist judges. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=91.96000000000001s)]
*  Of course, these days an activist judge is just a judge who disagrees with you. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=93.68s)]
*  The right-wing loves activist judges when they rule their way. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=97.36s)]
*  I think there's some virtue that you get when you're 84 years old. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=101.6s)]
*  You don't really care as much as if you were a younger judge. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=104.36s)]
*  I want to turn to two cases that we got yesterday, decisions, I should say. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=107.84s)]
*  One from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals basically said that Trump did have the authority [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=111.84s)]
*  to deputize the National Guard, despite what Gavin Newsom said, a real victory for Trump. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=116.28s)]
*  Another case from the federal judge said that Trump and the Department of Transportation [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=121.76s)]
*  did not have the authority to condition transportation funds on immigration actions. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=126.44s)]
*  Talk a bit about both cases and what they say for Trump's immigration powers going forward. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=132.12s)]
*  Well, the first one came from the formerly liberal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals out [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=135.96s)]
*  in California. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=140.56s)]
*  When the first term ended, President Trump appointed 10 out of the 29 judges there. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=142.1s)]
*  It became more of a centrist court and they gave a lot of deference to President Trump [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  in federalizing the National Guard. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=153.39999999999998s)]
*  They say, we're going to defer to the president, at least for now, until we get all the facts. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=155.04s)]
*  Then this is headed to the U.S. Supreme Court. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=159.48s)]
*  But it was definitely a win for the Trump administration. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=161.64s)]
*  In that three-judge panel, two of the judges were appointed by President Trump. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=163.95999999999998s)]
*  Interestingly, the third judge, who agreed with those two judges, was appointed by President [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  Biden. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=172.35999999999999s)]
*  So they gave a lot of deference to the president to come in and say, if we think there's a [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  federal policy at stake here, even under that statute they're invoking, we're going to allow [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  the federal government to federalize the National Guard. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=182.39999999999998s)]
*  The other case you mentioned, Sam, which was that case again? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=186.32s)]
*  It was a federal case where the judge said that the Department of Transportation cannot [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=189.79999999999998s)]
*  condition transportation funding to states, in this case California, I believe, if they [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=194.8s)]
*  disagree, for instance, with their immigration policies. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=200.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=203.76000000000002s)]
*  That's called the Duffy Directive. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=204.76000000000002s)]
*  So the Secretary of Transportation said that we're going to take away the federal transportation [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=205.92000000000002s)]
*  dollars from states that don't enforce our immigration orders. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=213.08s)]
*  Well, that's a little vague, isn't it? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=217.48000000000002s)]
*  And that's why these 20 states, all democratic states, went to the courts and said, your [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=219.28s)]
*  honor, this isn't right. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=224.12s)]
*  This is coercive. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=225.84s)]
*  And the judge, who was appointed by President Obama, agreed and said, no, it's too coercive. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=227.36s)]
*  Also, what does federal transportation dollars have to do with immigration policy? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=232.44s)]
*  I understand that if you want to coerce states to raise the drinking age from 18 to 21, remember [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=236.8s)]
*  when the federal government did that, you can then tie it to federal transportation [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=242.24s)]
*  dollars. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=246.88s)]
*  But there's really not much of a connection here. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=247.88s)]
*  to go into effect. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=250.64s)]
*  But this is yet another case that's headed up to the U.S. Supreme Court. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=254.2s)]
*  Well, and Gene, that's what's going to be so fascinating, because you have very conservative [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=257.68s)]
*  justices in John Roberts and Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh, who will predictably [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=262.32s)]
*  take stances that they've held throughout their entire judicial careers and probably [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=270.15999999999997s)]
*  also did going all the way back to law school. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=276.08s)]
*  But at the same time, on these questions of dramatic, some would say radical expansion [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=278.56s)]
*  of Article 2 powers by the Trump administration or their efforts to do that, that's where [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=284.12s)]
*  things get really interesting. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=288.76s)]
*  And you never know when John Roberts, Amy Coney Barrett, to a lesser degree, Brett Kavanaugh [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=291.04s)]
*  are going to go in their rulings. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=296.08s)]
*  Yeah, on the National Guard, I actually, you know, maybe I'm not a lawyer. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=297.96s)]
*  I don't think that's that radical, because I remember a couple of instances where Presidents [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=303.0s)]
*  Kennedy and Johnson, you know, during the Civil Rights Movement, federalized the National [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=307.71999999999997s)]
*  Guard of Alabama in order to enforce civil rights laws. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=312.56s)]
*  So by the way, the governors did not want that to happen either. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=316.64s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=321.15999999999997s)]
*  People are saying, oh my God, a president can't do this when a governor, you know, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=322.15999999999997s)]
*  when a governor doesn't want them to come in. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=326.24s)]
*  They never heard the tape recordings between the Kennedy administration and the Southern [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=328.76s)]
*  governors. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=333.64s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=334.64s)]
*  I think George Wallace step aside from the schoolhouse door so the University of Alabama [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=335.64s)]
*  could be, literally could be integrated. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=340.36s)]
*  So that I understand. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=344.4s)]
*  You know, can you withhold already appropriated transportation funds because a state isn't [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=345.4s)]
*  doing what you want on cooperating with ICE? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=352.36s)]
*  I don't think you can do that. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=355.76s)]
*  I'm not sure that even the Supreme Court is going to agree that a president can do that. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=357.15999999999997s)]
*  That's a bridge too far. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=363.03999999999996s)]
*  And Joe, if I could... [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=364.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=366.08s)]
*  Oh, sorry. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=367.08s)]
*  Just if the power of the purse goes to Congress, and even though Congress has emasculated itself, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=368.08s)]
*  it's still Congress that has to make this decision, not the executive branch. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxsnbaER0AM&t=372.15999999999997s)]
