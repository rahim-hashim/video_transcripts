# 'Flying grift': House Democrat says plane grift is 'too shocking to ignore'
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk)
*  So Democratic Congressman Richie Torres of New York is calling for an ethics investigation [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=0.0s)]
*  into President Trump's plan to accept a $400 million luxury jetliner from Qatar. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=6.44s)]
*  In a letter to multiple government watchdog agencies, Congressman Torres calls out what [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=12.64s)]
*  he describes as a quote, flying grift. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  And Congressman Richie Torres joins us now. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=20.68s)]
*  He's in Washington along with our Katty Kay. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=23.2s)]
*  Katty, take it away. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  Congressman, what is it about the plane? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=28.16s)]
*  I mean, there have been lots of business deals being done. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=30.0s)]
*  There are the meme coins. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=32.88s)]
*  But somehow this plane has got your Republican colleagues who have been remarkably silent [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=33.88s)]
*  about Donald Trump's activities so far actually speaking out. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=38.28s)]
*  Why are you calling for this investigation and why focus on the plane? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  Well, it's too shocking to ignore. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=45.040000000000006s)]
*  And instead of draining the swamp, as Donald Trump promised, he's filling the swamp to [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=47.32000000000001s)]
*  an extent never seen before. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=52.0s)]
*  He's filling the swamp with a Qatari Air Force One and a personal meme coin. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=53.44s)]
*  Donald Trump's receipt of a $400 million presidential palace in the sky may be the largest gift [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  that's ever been conferred on any president by any foreign government. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=65.84s)]
*  I've described it as a flying grift. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  And he should be facing accountability, but I have no confidence in the Department of [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=72.28s)]
*  Justice. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=75.44s)]
*  And as you know, the attorney general has put DOJ stamp of approval on a transaction [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=76.44s)]
*  that violates the U.S. Constitution. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=81.36s)]
*  Like the emoluments clause prohibits any president from receiving any gift from a foreign government [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=83.44s)]
*  without the approval of Congress. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=88.64s)]
*  And we have to send a message that no one, including Donald Trump, is above the law. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=91.12s)]
*  Congressman, good morning. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=94.56s)]
*  I'm reading a quote from you the other day. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=95.56s)]
*  You say, quote, in the cruelest irony, Air Force One will have something in common with [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=98.36000000000001s)]
*  Hamas paid for by Qatar if this deal does go through and become Air Force One. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=102.88000000000001s)]
*  We should underline again that experts say it would cost a billion dollars and perhaps [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=107.84s)]
*  until after the president's term to retrofit this plane to make it safe, secure for a president [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=112.56s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=119.08s)]
*  So we put that to the side. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=120.08s)]
*  I'm curious what you make of the Republican criticism, what it says about a group on Capitol [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=121.88s)]
*  Hill, as you know better than anyone who's very reluctant to criticize or cross this [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=126.84s)]
*  president that they have really to a man and a woman been speaking out against this idea. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=131.04s)]
*  Well, look, the Republicans have largely been complicit. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=137.27999999999997s)]
*  Instead of holding Donald Trump accountable, the Republicans have been enabling a pattern [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=141.11999999999998s)]
*  of presidential profiteering. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=145.72s)]
*  I mean, not only is Donald Trump receiving a flying palace from the Qatari royal family, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=146.72s)]
*  but he's been caught selling access to the White House, to the 220 highest bidders for [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=152.6s)]
*  his personal mean coin. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=157.95999999999998s)]
*  Meanwhile, a separate foreign government has agreed to give $2 billion to World Liberty [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=159.76s)]
*  Financial, which is owned by the Trump family. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=165.8s)]
*  And if you invest $2 billion in foreign deposits in U.S. treasuries yielding 4 percent a year, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=168.4s)]
*  that's $80 million in profits. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=174.32s)]
*  So there are layers and layers and layers of grift and influence peddling to which the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=176.24s)]
*  Republican Party has largely turned a blind eye. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=181.66s)]
*  And the Republicans face a test. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=185.07999999999998s)]
*  We have to ask the Republicans, where does your loyalty lie? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=186.88s)]
*  Does it lie with the Constitution or does it lie with Donald Trump? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=189.0s)]
*  Are we governed by the rule of law or are we governed by a cult of personality? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=192.32s)]
*  I wanted to ask you about something that you have recently said about Senator John Fetterman. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=196.64s)]
*  You have come to his defense. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=203.95999999999998s)]
*  He's been considered by many to be incapable of continuing service there in the United [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=206.23999999999998s)]
*  States Senate. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=214.76s)]
*  You've said that actually it has more to do with his view on Israel than his mental health. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=217.2s)]
*  Talk about that. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=224.72s)]
*  Yes, I have no insight into the workings of Senator Fetterman's office, but I just find [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=226.4s)]
*  it curious that he had challenges back in 2022 when he first ran for the Senate. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=232.88s)]
*  And I do not recall any of his critics, voice and concerns. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=239.52s)]
*  The moment there was a change in his politics, then he suddenly became a target. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=243.7s)]
*  Some people would call that a coincidence. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=248.42s)]
*  I feel it's too coincidental to be a coincidence. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=250.01999999999998s)]
*  So that's, I'm suspicious. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=253.29999999999998s)]
*  I've been in politics for about 20 years. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=254.94s)]
*  I've been an elected official for 10 years. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=256.65999999999997s)]
*  I know a hitch job when I see one. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=259.65999999999997s)]
*  Congressman, can we take it back to your district? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=262.06s)]
*  Because I have a feeling that I don't know how much they're talking about the category [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=264.38s)]
*  plane. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=267.82s)]
*  I don't know how much they're talking about the health of Senator Fetterman, but they [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=268.82s)]
*  probably are talking about Medicaid and what's happening up on the Hill. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=272.26s)]
*  How would what is being proposed at the moment in the bill affect your district and your [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=275.7s)]
*  constituents? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=282.09999999999997s)]
*  There is no congressional district in America that has a greater stake in Medicaid than [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=283.65999999999997s)]
*  my congressional district in the Bronx. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=288.53999999999996s)]
*  A 67 percent of my district is enrolled in Medicaid. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=290.78s)]
*  In my district, more than 70 percent of children, more than 80 percent of nursing home residents, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=295.34s)]
*  more than 90 percent of baby deliveries are covered by Medicaid. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=300.06s)]
*  There is not a single safety net hospital in the Bronx that could survive the kind of [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=304.54s)]
*  draconian cuts that the Republican Party is proposing. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=308.5s)]
*  So the Republican $715 billion assault on Medicaid is a catastrophe for congressional [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=311.74s)]
*  districts like mine, but it's a catastrophe for the country. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=319.3s)]
*  In most major counties in America, both urban and rural, both blue and red, the largest [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=321.7s)]
*  employer tends to be the health care provider and you're destabilizing the largest employers [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=327.86s)]
*  in America. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=333.22s)]
*  You know, Congressman, there's long been this belief among Republicans, whether they said [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=334.22s)]
*  it in front of microphones or not, it was there when Republicans were trying to cut [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=340.46000000000004s)]
*  Medicaid by $240 billion in 1995 to help fund tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=345.62s)]
*  There was this belief that Medicaid helps people of color in urban districts. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=353.58s)]
*  The fact is, here we are in 2025, it's people in red state America, it's rural hospitals [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=360.62s)]
*  that are actually disproportionately impacted by this. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=369.18s)]
*  With that reality, I'm curious, we're hearing Donald Trump saying repeatedly Medicaid will [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=373.29999999999995s)]
*  not be cut. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=378.79999999999995s)]
*  We have guests coming on the show who are Republicans who are saying Medicaid will not [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=380.06s)]
*  be cut. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=385.34s)]
*  And yet here are the numbers. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=386.62s)]
*  It looks like Medicaid is going to be cut. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=387.7s)]
*  Do we have any specific numbers right now on what the Republican House plan is to slash [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=390.34s)]
*  Medicaid funding? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=396.62s)]
*  So let's be honest, so they can pay for tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=398.06s)]
*  So Republicans are going to defund Medicaid by $715 billion in order to fund more than [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=404.6s)]
*  a trillion dollars in tax cuts, not for everyday Americans, but simply for the top 1%. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=410.84000000000003s)]
*  Under Donald Trump and congressional Republicans, 13.7 million Americans are in danger of losing [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=417.70000000000005s)]
*  their health coverage, not only because of the Republican reconciliation bill, but because [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=422.36s)]
*  of a Trump regulation and the expiration of the Affordable Care Act's subsidies premium [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=426.44s)]
*  tax credits. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=431.76000000000005s)]
*  So 13.7 million Americans. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=432.84s)]
*  And keep in mind that Medicaid has become as vital to senior citizens as Medicare. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=435.91999999999996s)]
*  In New York, the elderly and the disabled make up 20% of Medicaid enrollees, but 60% [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=443.59999999999997s)]
*  of Medicaid expenses. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=450.44s)]
*  And so make no mistake, the Republican Party's attack on Medicaid is an attack on the elderly [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=452.28s)]
*  and the disabled, the most vulnerable people in our society. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=457.44s)]
*  And again, that's in red state America and blue state America. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=461.08s)]
*  Mika, there have been estimates that up to 50% of children in rural America get their [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=466.4s)]
*  primary health care from Medicaid. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=473.88s)]
*  We all know so many parents of ours and grandparents who go into nursing facilities, especially [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=477.56s)]
*  in rural America. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=485.24s)]
*  They go into Medicaid-funded facilities. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=487.36s)]
*  This will be absolutely devastating, not only for people in cities and in urban centers. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=490.84s)]
*  It'll be especially devastating, disproportionately devastating to Americans in red state America, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=497.11999999999995s)]
*  and especially to those rural hospitals that are going to shut down. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=505.71999999999997s)]
*  And when they shut down, that means families are going to have to drive maybe 100, 150 [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=508.59999999999997s)]
*  miles if they're in certain states to get the type of health care that they need. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=513.92s)]
*  This is the spot where Democrats should stay in, like Richie Torres, that not sit back [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=518.92s)]
*  and watch things happen. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=525.4s)]
*  This impacts everybody, and if there's any way to help. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ihUz4PUSgk&t=527.88s)]
