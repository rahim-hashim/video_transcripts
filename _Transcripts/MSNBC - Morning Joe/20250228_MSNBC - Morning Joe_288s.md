# Can Sen. Elissa Slotkin’s appeal help Democrats expand their reach in 2026?
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g)
*  Freshman Senator Alyssa Slotkin of Michigan will deliver the Democratic response to Trump's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=0.0s)]
*  joint address to Congress on Tuesday. Slotkin, a former CIA analyst, was able to pull off a win [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=5.36s)]
*  in Michigan while former Vice President Kamala Harris lost the state by roughly 80,000 votes. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=10.88s)]
*  Meanwhile, Congressman Adriano Espaillat will deliver the Spanish language response for [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=16.56s)]
*  Democrats. Espaillat currently chairs the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and is the [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=20.8s)]
*  first Dominican American and first formerly undocumented immigrant to serve in Congress. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=25.6s)]
*  Joining us now, Congressional reporter for Punchbowl News, Max Cohen. Max, first, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  what do you make of the Slotkin choice? Notoriously, the response on either side of [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=34.64s)]
*  the political aisle is kind of a thankless position. Sure. Yeah. I mean, listen, that shows [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=39.28s)]
*  exactly where Democrats want to go, which is looking at how the party can come out of the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=44.08s)]
*  political wilderness. Slotkin won in Michigan, as you mentioned, while Trump won. And many in the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=48.24s)]
*  base are saying, how can we win back these seats? What message works to win over Trump voters, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=54.4s)]
*  even in states where Democrats have struggled? So she'll give an economic message, we believe, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=59.76s)]
*  to say, look, Democrats need to return to their roots as a working class party. And also, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=64.64s)]
*  build bridges, a bipartisan message, as Republicans control all of Washington, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=69.28s)]
*  how they can assert their power. Yeah. Slotkin, one of those fascinating circumstances, but also [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=73.44s)]
*  the same with Gallego, with Cortez Masto out in Nevada, Gallego, of course, in Arizona, where [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=77.52s)]
*  they managed to win their Senate races, but Trump, of course, took their state overall in [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=82.64s)]
*  the presidential. Is that something that's informing how the party is thinking about [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=87.28s)]
*  its rising stars? Or is it also people like Brian Schatz and Chris Murphy, who have been very vocal, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=91.04s)]
*  and to varying degrees, successfully so, in this Trump environment? Yeah. I think there's an [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=97.2s)]
*  incredible mix happening right now. Some in the base want their party leaders to be as aggressive [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=102.0s)]
*  as possible in combating Trump. And I think that's kind of the Murphy-Schatz angle you just [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=107.44s)]
*  mentioned. But also, some more pragmatic voters say, hey, look, we love the resistance vibe, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=111.84s)]
*  but we also want someone who has a proven track record of winning tough elections. So it's that [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=117.12s)]
*  kind of push and pull, which is leading to this Democratic confusion right now, as the progressive [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=121.52000000000001s)]
*  base and maybe the more pragmatic base want a couple of different things. I know you and I [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=126.0s)]
*  were talking while we were off camera about the town hall that I was at last night, and I was [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=130.8s)]
*  talking to Alencia Johnson about this, a Democratic strategist who was just on. There is palpable [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=134.4s)]
*  frustration from Democrats that they're not doing enough, and at the same time, at least those in [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=138.64s)]
*  Congress are pretty hamstrung by being in the minority. Is there anyone who people see as [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=143.04s)]
*  rising above that, as you're talking to strategists and others putting together this rising stars list? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's a good question, because there is not much they can do, and that's what they're [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=152.48s)]
*  reminding voters almost at every turn. I think Brian Schatz is someone, it's important to note, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=155.92s)]
*  actually is doing something. He said right after Trump was trying to dismantle USAID, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=160.72s)]
*  the Hawaii Democrat said, I'm going to place a hold on every single foreign policy nomination [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=166.08s)]
*  and make Trump work to get these nominees across the finish line. So he's using his leverage in [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=170.8s)]
*  the Senate, which every individual center has that right. Remember, Tommy Tuberville did a similar [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=175.52s)]
*  thing with the FETS nominations, and in the Senate you can assert that power, but in the House and [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=179.84s)]
*  other places, Democrats are very limited. Can you just give me the names of a few House members? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=184.72000000000003s)]
*  I know we love the Senate, but we're House people. We've got a soft spot for them. Any rising stars [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=189.52s)]
*  on that side? I think Jasmine Crockett is someone who is omnipresent on cable news and social media. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=193.92s)]
*  Maxwell Frost is a very young Gen Z member of Congress who young people are looking to, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=198.95999999999998s)]
*  and I think it's that kind of media savvy next generation of young. Robert Garcia, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=203.76s)]
*  a number member, comes to mind. They can really perform on new media, talk to influencers, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=207.92s)]
*  get on Instagram reels, maybe even TikTok, and that's where a lot of the voters who are maybe [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=212.88s)]
*  frustrated are turning to get their news. Turning there, and then also people like Pat Ryan in New [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=217.11999999999998s)]
*  York who won one of those tough races that people are like, hey, can we replicate that politically [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=221.28s)]
*  across the country? Max Cohen, Max Cohen, tracking these rising stars for us. Thank you for coming on. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=225.44s)]
*  And earlier in the show, we asked you, why are you awake? One viewer emails, I'm getting an [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=231.6s)]
*  early start on celebrating my unbirthday as there is no February 29th this year to celebrate my [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=236.24s)]
*  leap year birthday. As they say in Alice in Wonderland, a very merry unbirthday to you. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=241.68s)]
*  Kayla is awake with seven months old twins who are early risers. Wow. And Don is still awake [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=246.16s)]
*  in California. He writes, I swear I'm going to start going to bed earlier, but it's your [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=253.2s)]
*  fault for making the news so interesting. Max, you're keeping people awake in California. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=257.12s)]
*  Save the people, let them go to bed, but not during this show or morning jokes. So stay up a little bit longer. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=262.88s)]
