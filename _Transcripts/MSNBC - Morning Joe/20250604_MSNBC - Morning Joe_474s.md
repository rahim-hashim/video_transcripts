# Rand Paul doubles down slamming bill, saying he won't support 'a $5T increase to our deficit'
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4)
*  Meanwhile, as President Trump ramps up pressure on Senate Republicans now to back his massive [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=0.0s)]
*  spending bill, he's calling out one vocal holdout. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=5.98s)]
*  That's Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=9.46s)]
*  Trump posted on social media yesterday that the senator has very little understanding [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=12.06s)]
*  of the bill, later adding, the people of Kentucky can't stand him. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=16.92s)]
*  Paul later responded to the president saying he will not support a bill that raises the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=22.04s)]
*  debt ceiling by trillions of dollars. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=26.48s)]
*  The senator has said he believes four Republicans are opposed to the package as it stands. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=29.22s)]
*  Republicans have a slim majority in the Senate and can only afford to lose three votes on [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=36.019999999999996s)]
*  the bill. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=43.22s)]
*  John Bresnahan, what do we know about how the Senate will respond to this, especially [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=44.22s)]
*  given the impact it will have on people who rely on things that are going to be cut if [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=49.9s)]
*  this passes? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=55.739999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=57.74s)]
*  Rand Paul is right right now. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=58.74s)]
*  There's probably enough votes to stop this bill. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=59.74s)]
*  If you take Rand Paul, you take Ron Johnson, who would not vote for this bill as it is, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=62.14s)]
*  you take some of the conservatives. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=67.34s)]
*  And then there's moderate senators like Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska or Susan Collins [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=70.46000000000001s)]
*  of Maine. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=76.42s)]
*  They have problems. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=77.42s)]
*  There's other senators have big problems with the Medicaid portions of this bill. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=78.42s)]
*  So I think there's, you know, they're going to have to change this bill. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=82.28s)]
*  The question is, and Mike Johnson was talking about it, is like, if you change this bill, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=85.89999999999999s)]
*  this bill only passed by one vote in the House. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=91.02s)]
*  If you change this bill in the Senate to get it through somehow, you lose that. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=93.53999999999999s)]
*  If you tack to the middle in the Senate, you lose the right in the House. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=97.69999999999999s)]
*  And that's a huge problem. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=101.33999999999999s)]
*  That's where trouble has to be, you know, just knocking heads on it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=102.61999999999999s)]
*  But they have problems on it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=106.66s)]
*  I mean, they've got major work to be done in the next couple of weeks, especially if [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=108.22s)]
*  they're thinking two things. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=112.53999999999999s)]
*  One, they want to get done by July 4th and they got the debt limit at mid-July. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=114.26s)]
*  And that's a huge, that's the backstop of everything. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=117.66000000000001s)]
*  That's the ticking time bomb on this legislation. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=120.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=122.10000000000001s)]
*  Mark Caputo, I'm going to channel Joe a little bit who would say these guys who've called [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=123.10000000000001s)]
*  themselves their entire lives, small government conservatives who cast a vote in support of [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=127.10000000000001s)]
*  this bill, given what it does to the debt and the deficit. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=132.22s)]
*  There's just no way you can call yourself a small government conservative and vote for [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=136.14000000000001s)]
*  this and yet many of them are doing just that. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=139.02s)]
*  Elon Musk's criticism as part of your reporting does give cover to people like Rand Paul and [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=141.82s)]
*  Ron Johnson and others to maybe be a little more emboldened to come out and say, yeah, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=147.5s)]
*  what Elon said is right. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=151.22s)]
*  We can't pass this. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=153.1s)]
*  So do you think that perhaps Elon Musk's public criticism has helped to torpedo this thing? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=154.14000000000001s)]
*  I think it's certainly given credit or cover to the critics that you said. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=160.58s)]
*  But let's also be clear about the history of the Republican Party. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=165.26000000000002s)]
*  Going back to George Bush II, George W. Bush, they've been massive deficit spenders and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=169.26s)]
*  expanders of government at the same time as presenting themselves as these fiscal hawks. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=175.78s)]
*  The difference with the Trump era Republican Party is that this is the first party that [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=182.34s)]
*  has said Medicaid, you know, it's pretty good. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=188.14s)]
*  Medicare, pretty good. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=191.02s)]
*  Social Security, pretty good. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=192.02s)]
*  Don't touch entitlements. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=193.3s)]
*  That's where you come to this very precarious position for Republicans when they're in charge [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=195.18s)]
*  of Congress because they basically got three issues at their weighing. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=200.82s)]
*  They have tax cuts, which all Republicans essentially have to vote for as part of their [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=205.18s)]
*  dogma. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=209.62s)]
*  You've got deficit reduction and you've got Medicaid that they want to continue. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=210.62s)]
*  And in the end, the deficit reduction is the thing that's going to crater. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=215.66s)]
*  And that is where Elon Musk is 100 percent right. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=219.9s)]
*  This does cause higher deficits and bigger debt. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=223.24s)]
*  And there's just no way for the White House to figure its way out of that. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=225.92s)]
*  What Donald Trump is going to have to do is he's going to have to twist arms. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=229.0s)]
*  He's going to have to do a little bit of subtle begging, promising, cajoling, the full bag [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=232.24s)]
*  of tricks he's going to have to pull out in order to get this passed. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=237.16s)]
*  In the end, it's still a Republican Congress. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=240.22s)]
*  He's still the Republican leader. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=242.68s)]
*  He's still popular in the party. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=243.92s)]
*  It does look, judging by the past, that'll probably get it done. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=245.6s)]
*  But just how he does it is really hard to see right now. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=249.12s)]
*  So often in the Trump era, it comes down to the personal Donald Trump weighing and leaning [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=251.96s)]
*  on some of these guys to get their votes and them not willing to cross him. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=256.68s)]
*  One of those members of Congress, Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene, voted to pass the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=261.1s)]
*  sweeping domestic policy bill last month, is now coming out against the legislation. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=265.12s)]
*  In a social media post yesterday, Taylor Greene appeared to admit she hadn't read the text [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=270.12s)]
*  carefully enough and that she missed parts of the bill that stripped states of the right [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=275.32s)]
*  to regulate or make laws concerning artificial intelligence for the next 10 years. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=279.68s)]
*  She says she is opposed to that and will vote against the final version of the bill unless [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=284.08000000000004s)]
*  the Senate removes that provision. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=290.08000000000004s)]
*  So important to read carefully, I guess, is the lesson here, John. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=292.92s)]
*  Really, the jokes right themselves. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=296.20000000000005s)]
*  I mean, this is typical of, well, maybe of Marjorie Taylor Greene, but it's reflective [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=297.20000000000005s)]
*  of just how hurried this process was. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=302.64000000000004s)]
*  It was so rushed and some of it was done in the middle of the night. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=304.68s)]
*  We heard Democrats complain about that. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=308.64s)]
*  And now we're learning that some members of Congress didn't even read through the whole [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=310.64s)]
*  bill. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=314.72s)]
*  They were their staff and missed important provisions. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=315.72s)]
*  And now Marjorie Taylor Greene is suggesting that this is a real sticking point. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=317.44s)]
*  So not only is it a poor reflection of how they got here, but it also, again, points [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=320.84000000000003s)]
*  to the challenge that lie ahead. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=325.8s)]
*  That if the Senate's going to make real changes, Marjorie Taylor Greene is saying, if you don't [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=327.12s)]
*  make this change, I won't vote for it. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=331.64s)]
*  But we also know some other Republicans in the House Speaker are saying that if they [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=333.24s)]
*  do make the Senate makes too many changes, we won't vote for it. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=336.88s)]
*  So yes, to Mark's point in the moment ago, President Trump remains very popular in the [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=340.2s)]
*  party. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=345.32s)]
*  He has an iron grip, it seems, on both houses of Congress. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=346.32s)]
*  It's hard to imagine too many Republicans will defy him. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=349.84s)]
*  A few do. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=352.8s)]
*  We see Thomas Massie, a congressman of Kentucky, do it all the time. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=353.8s)]
*  But very few do. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=356.68s)]
*  So the odds are he'll get this through, but there's a lot of hurdles he's going to have [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=358.28s)]
*  to clear, particularly in that accelerated timetable, July 4th, one month from today. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=361.8s)]
*  Wow. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=367.15999999999997s)]
*  John Bresnahan, before we go, where do you see this going today? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=368.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, I think, look, there's the two big meetings. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=372.24s)]
*  There's the meeting with Trump at the White House with these finance committee Republicans, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=374.96s)]
*  and then the Senate Republicans themselves are sitting down and going to talk. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=378.71999999999997s)]
*  I think they've got a lot of work to do, as everybody's talked about. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=382.92s)]
*  I mean, I do think they'll get this done at the end of the day because literally they've [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=386.0s)]
*  done nothing else in this Congress. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=390.48s)]
*  If they don't pass this, they have nothing to run on in 2026. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=392.0s)]
*  They've done nothing. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=395.04s)]
*  So they get this done, I think, at the end of the day. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=396.20000000000005s)]
*  Will they have to scale it back? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=398.88s)]
*  Or I don't know. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=400.20000000000005s)]
*  But I do think this is a big day for Republicans, Senate Republicans. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=401.76000000000005s)]
*  They've got to get some forward momentum. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=405.68s)]
*  The must thing, the must up yesterday really dented them. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=407.8s)]
*  They've got problems on their right. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=412.16s)]
*  They've got problems in their center. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=413.76s)]
*  So, you know, I do think this is, you know, Trump is going to have to really get in there [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=415.76s)]
*  and tell guys that I want this. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8vmRWdORX4&t=420.6s)]
