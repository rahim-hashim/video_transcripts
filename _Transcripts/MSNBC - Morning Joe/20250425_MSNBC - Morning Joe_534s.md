# Hegseth 'anxious and concerned' about his job: WSJ reporter on Pentagon 'chaos'
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [April 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms)
*  Two sources familiar with the situation telling NBC News that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=0.0s)]
*  has become, quote, erratic, and he seems increasingly insecure about his job. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=5.24s)]
*  I don't have time for leakers. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=9.88s)]
*  The Pentagon senior staff also facing turmoil. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=11.92s)]
*  Hegseth accusing the acting chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of leaks and threatening [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=14.88s)]
*  to polygraph him, according to three U.S. officials familiar with the meeting. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=19.2s)]
*  And after allegations that Hegseth texted military information to a private signal group, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=23.52s)]
*  the group called it, quote, childish in a call to the defense secretary and indicated [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=28.56s)]
*  he wasn't pleased, according to two U.S. officials. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=32.4s)]
*  But one said the president told the defense secretary to keep fighting. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=35.44s)]
*  NBC's Garrett Haake reporting for us there. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=39.44s)]
*  Meanwhile, two sources tell The Wall Street Journal Defense Secretary Hegseth shouted [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=41.84s)]
*  at Admiral Christopher Grady after news broke about Elon Musk possibly attending a classified [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=45.84s)]
*  briefing on China. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=51.4s)]
*  Hegseth reportedly threatened, as Garrett just mentioned, to hook Grady up to a polygraph, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=52.72s)]
*  talking what the journal calls a turning point in an already rocky tenure. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=58.4s)]
*  Let's bring in one of the reporters on that piece, Wall Street Journal national security [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=62.64s)]
*  reporter, Alex Ward. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=66.96s)]
*  Alex, good morning. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=68.16s)]
*  Good to have you back on the show. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=69.16s)]
*  We were talking to your colleague, Nancy, a little bit earlier in the show about this [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=71.12s)]
*  extraordinary piece with some very rich details. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=73.96s)]
*  What jumped out at you as you reported out this story? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=77.68s)]
*  I think the main thing was just how truly anxious and concerned Hegseth is for the future [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=81.46s)]
*  of his job, as much as President Trump and the team around him says Hegseth is safe, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=87.4s)]
*  that they trust him. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=91.68s)]
*  That may all well be true, but Hegseth seems to believe that he needs to basically fight [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=93.32s)]
*  not only in the public domain, but within his own Pentagon in order to stay in charge. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=98.6s)]
*  And that includes threatening even top military advisers to take polygraph tests. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=102.84s)]
*  And now that he has a pretty bare bones front office, the irony of all of this is by firing [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=107.84s)]
*  a bunch of people, by releasing a bunch of people believed to be leakers, that actually [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=114.4s)]
*  makes it even harder for him to do the job of the Pentagon and the job of the Defense [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=118.24s)]
*  Department and the military, which could then of course spiral and look badly upon him down [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=122.24s)]
*  the line. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=128.0s)]
*  So he's in a pretty tight spot. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=129.0s)]
*  He may not lose his job. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=130.56s)]
*  I mean, we don't know. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=131.88s)]
*  He may, he may not. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=133.0s)]
*  But clearly it's just not looking good for him. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=134.12s)]
*  And he's not doing anything to make a situation really any better. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=135.92s)]
*  And by the way, those people he fired were his own people. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=138.56s)]
*  They weren't like they were Biden deep staters that were turning on him. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=141.07999999999998s)]
*  Those were his own guys. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=144.23999999999998s)]
*  Does he feel because he at least for now and publicly anyway, has the support of the president, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=145.76s)]
*  like his job is secure? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=151.16s)]
*  Or is he really concerned that his days are numbered? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=152.16s)]
*  I think it's a bit of both, right? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=155.95999999999998s)]
*  I mean, President Trump has been pretty staunch in his support for Hegseth, but we also know [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=157.35999999999999s)]
*  the president's history is that you could be safe today and gone tomorrow. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=161.39999999999998s)]
*  So if you are Pete Hegseth, you're trying to prove yourself literally on camera by combating [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=165.2s)]
*  the media, by being strong in the president's parlance and by going after alleged leakers. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=169.64s)]
*  I mean, he's trying to do both a PR campaign in order to keep Trump on his side and at [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=177.79999999999998s)]
*  the same time, try to clean house at the Pentagon because he believes truly that he is doing [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=183.76s)]
*  some sort of large mission here that hasn't been done at the Pentagon forever and that [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=188.88s)]
*  he's facing immense resistance. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=193.72s)]
*  And so he will, it seems, move anyone out of his way that could be going against that [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=195.23999999999998s)]
*  own agenda. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=199.95999999999998s)]
*  And that includes, as you mentioned, people that he literally brought in his own aides [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=200.95999999999998s)]
*  and loyalists for many years. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  Alex, the Secretary of Defense, the president's secretary of defense has a fondness for the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=207.16s)]
*  phrase war fighters. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=214.51999999999998s)]
*  He's every doing everything every day in order to help the war fighters. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=217.28s)]
*  But the everyday function of the Defense Department, thankfully, has less to do with wars right [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=221.92s)]
*  now than it has to do with administering defense and defense of America around the world. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=227.51999999999998s)]
*  Where does he stand with the, not the top echelon, not the generals, but the colonels, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=233.76s)]
*  the majors, the master sergeants who were around the ring in the Pentagon who make that [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=239.7s)]
*  place run every day? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=245.94s)]
*  Where does he stand with them? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=247.26s)]
*  Do you know? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=248.72s)]
*  It's hard to know, right? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=251.22s)]
*  One, you know, there's just a bunch of people there. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=252.22s)]
*  But I think it's fair to say that if you have a defense secretary who is threatening top [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=254.26s)]
*  military brass and others with polygraph tests because they might be seen as disloyal, that [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=258.46s)]
*  could not necessarily ingratiate himself to a building. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=264.58s)]
*  That we should note has been already kind of hostile to him because he has different [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=267.48s)]
*  ideas of how the Defense Department should run and the military should run than that [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=271.34s)]
*  building has seen for quite some time. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=274.52s)]
*  And the Hexeth would note that recruiting numbers are up. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=276.66s)]
*  So in fact, in his mind, what he's doing seems to be appealing to the warfighter or even [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=279.38s)]
*  potential warfighters around the country. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=283.96s)]
*  But there's no question that there is increasing tensions. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=285.88s)]
*  I mean, I know we've mentioned a few times, but it is genuinely a remarkable thing to [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=288.54s)]
*  have the defense secretary yell as he did at the then acting Joint Chiefs Chair and [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=293.58s)]
*  threaten him with a polygraph test. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=299.42s)]
*  That is not a normal thing that happens. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=300.9s)]
*  There are, of course, disagreements between a defense secretary and a joint chiefs chair, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=302.74s)]
*  and they can occasionally get heated and impassioned. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=307.46s)]
*  But it is not like making that threat is a normal everyday run, of course, for a defense [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=311.18s)]
*  secretary. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=316.97999999999996s)]
*  That shows the level of concern and anxiety that's within his front office. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=317.97999999999996s)]
*  And that surely, you know, leadership, the price of leadership is that how you feel and [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=321.82s)]
*  how you act tends to permeate throughout the building. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=326.82s)]
*  So it would not surprise me that there are people more concerned today about Hexeth leadership [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=329.06s)]
*  than they were yesterday. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=333.29999999999995s)]
*  Ms. Simone Sanders-Townsend, I guess my question is, how is the building being run right now? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=336.06s)]
*  Because there is, yes, you have the secretary, you have the secretary's advisors, you also [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=341.86s)]
*  have the chief of staff. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=346.62s)]
*  The chief of staff's office really works with the day to day. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=347.94s)]
*  But the chief of staff has now left. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=350.52s)]
*  Many of the advisors are now gone. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=352.1s)]
*  And again, to Willie's point, these are folks that the secretary brought in himself. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=353.9s)]
*  So how is the building actually being run right now? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=358.1s)]
*  Can we expect to see any statements, anything else, coming out of the secretary's office [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=363.58s)]
*  to clean up what is a huge mess and distraction, frankly, for the White House? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=368.22s)]
*  It's a bit unclear. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=375.1s)]
*  Well, in terms of how the Pentagon runs, I mean, the front office is quite bare bones [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=376.1s)]
*  at this point. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=380.7s)]
*  They are not able to keep up with just an immense amount of paper that an $300 billion, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=381.7s)]
*  3 million personnel building requires. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=388.1s)]
*  I mean, you need not only a chief of staff and senior advisors, but you need a bunch [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=390.74s)]
*  of career people working in lockstep with the secretary and, of course, the president's [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=394.58000000000004s)]
*  vision. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=398.1s)]
*  They just don't have that right now. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=399.1s)]
*  There's actually, to give credit to a rival publication, Politico has a great story last [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=400.1s)]
*  night or this morning just about the open wound within the front office. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=405.90000000000003s)]
*  Not only is there dysfunction and distrust, but there's just a personnel and capacity [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=411.3s)]
*  problem. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=416.1s)]
*  The way it is today is just not being run well at the Pentagon. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=417.1s)]
*  And so what's going to happen here is things are going to fall through the cracks. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=420.42s)]
*  Now, if you're Pete Hegseth, you don't think that matters necessarily because you'll eventually [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=423.42s)]
*  hire more people and you'll figure this out. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=428.06s)]
*  But in the meantime, he has to show not only to President Trump, but to the people in the [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=430.70000000000005s)]
*  building that he can still run the Pentagon aptly, that he's the right guy for the job. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=436.02000000000004s)]
*  And if more were to leak out, if more damaging information were to come out, that not only [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=441.14000000000004s)]
*  imperils, of course, the Pentagon's own mission, but Hegseth's own employment. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=445.86s)]
*  So it's again a very tense time to be Pete Hegseth, but he's clinging on to his job because [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=449.58000000000004s)]
*  he loves it and he's doing everything he can to stay there. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=455.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=457.22s)]
*  And this preoccupation with perceived leakers, everything else, a signal scandal and being [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=458.22s)]
*  on TV to protect himself means he's not actually doing the very, very difficult job of running [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnDgitrf7Ms&t=461.82s)]
