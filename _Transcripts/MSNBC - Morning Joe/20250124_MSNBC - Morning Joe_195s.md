# Trump pulls security detail for Mike Pompeo, top aide amid Iran threats
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELDAEto3Zq0)
*  I do want to start, though, with what you read off the top, the news off the top. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELDAEto3Zq0&t=0.0s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal has written about it, where they talk about some ex-Trump officials [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELDAEto3Zq0&t=4.32s)]
*  losing security. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELDAEto3Zq0&t=9.96s)]
*  This is what they say in their editorial, on the Wall Street Journal editorial page [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELDAEto3Zq0&t=10.96s)]
*  today, a Murdoch paper. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELDAEto3Zq0&t=14.36s)]
*  Trump leaves ex-aids unprotected. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELDAEto3Zq0&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  The possibility of falling out of President Trump's good graces is an occupational hazard [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELDAEto3Zq0&t=20.32s)]
*  for good people who serve in his administration. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELDAEto3Zq0&t=24.900000000000002s)]
*  This looks like a new low. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELDAEto3Zq0&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  Mr. Trump reportedly has ordered an end to security protection for three former advisors [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELDAEto3Zq0&t=29.64s)]
*  who are living under the threat of assassination by Iran. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELDAEto3Zq0&t=35.76s)]
*  Pray it won't happen, but what if one of them now gets attacked? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELDAEto3Zq0&t=39.8s)]
*  If Iran commits violence against any of these men, Mr. Trump won't be able to escape responsibility. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELDAEto3Zq0&t=45.52s)]
*  Also, what is Secretary of State Marco Rubio supposed to think about the boss's refusal [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELDAEto3Zq0&t=50.24s)]
*  to protect his predecessor? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELDAEto3Zq0&t=56.36s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal editorial page. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELDAEto3Zq0&t=58.52s)]
*  Obviously, really, a lot of people talking about this, but again, these men are under [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELDAEto3Zq0&t=60.32s)]
*  threat of death by Iran because they were the ones that helped carry out the attack [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELDAEto3Zq0&t=66.32000000000001s)]
*  on Soleimani back when they were serving for none other than Donald Trump. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELDAEto3Zq0&t=72.28s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that's exactly the point, which is they are under threat because of the orders [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELDAEto3Zq0&t=77.56s)]
*  they received from Donald Trump, because of the policies of the Trump administration. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELDAEto3Zq0&t=82.80000000000001s)]
*  Now, for petty reasons, some grievance that Donald Trump has, you have to dig deep to [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELDAEto3Zq0&t=86.52s)]
*  remember what it is. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELDAEto3Zq0&t=91.92s)]
*  He's pulling, according to all this reporting, security for not just Mike Pompeo, but others. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELDAEto3Zq0&t=93.52s)]
*  John Bolton, we talked about a couple of days ago, but one of the top aides to Mike Pompeo [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELDAEto3Zq0&t=99.24s)]
*  also having his security pulled, somebody who was at his side for all of these decisions. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELDAEto3Zq0&t=103.64s)]
*  When Donald Trump promised retribution during the campaign, it turns out he meant it when [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELDAEto3Zq0&t=109.16s)]
*  he promised to empty the jails of January six convicts. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELDAEto3Zq0&t=114.56s)]
*  It turns out he meant it. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELDAEto3Zq0&t=118.68s)]
*  So we're learning in this very first week, these first few days of the Trump administration, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELDAEto3Zq0&t=120.28s)]
*  if people didn't already to take seriously his threats. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELDAEto3Zq0&t=124.8s)]
*  Well, you know, Meekin, what's so fascinating about this list is, of course, people have [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELDAEto3Zq0&t=127.76s)]
*  seen that John Bolton has been critical of Donald Trump. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELDAEto3Zq0&t=132.64000000000001s)]
*  Mike Pompeo, not so much. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELDAEto3Zq0&t=137.32s)]
*  But Brian Hook, what's so fascinating about Brian Hook is, and some of the people in Washington [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELDAEto3Zq0&t=139.04s)]
*  are asking the question why he's a guy who, you know, kept his head down, a professional [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELDAEto3Zq0&t=143.56s)]
*  and a professional who's an envoy to Iran and didn't get out there attacking anybody, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELDAEto3Zq0&t=148.92s)]
*  stayed nonpolitical. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELDAEto3Zq0&t=156.79999999999998s)]
*  So it is deeply perplexing to a lot of people why his security clearance got pulled. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELDAEto3Zq0&t=158.51999999999998s)]
*  And of course, obviously disturbing that the others too did when again, like President [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELDAEto3Zq0&t=164.39999999999998s)]
*  Trump, they are under direct threat from the Iranian government. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELDAEto3Zq0&t=169.56s)]
