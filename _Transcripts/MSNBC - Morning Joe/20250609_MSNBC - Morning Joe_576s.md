Video Description: The National Guard was deployed in Los Angeles Sunday morning as President Trump responded to days of protest against federal immigration raids.

# 'All they are looking for is a scene': Strategist on Trump deploying National Guard to L.A.
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI)
*  Barbara, you first here. Where does the Trump administration stand legally here? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=0.0s)]
*  Because Trump has mobilized the National Guard without a request from the state's governor. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=4.72s)]
*  And that is the first time that's happened since 1965. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=9.36s)]
*  There is concern over violating the Posse Comitados Act. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=13.4s)]
*  So does the president have the authority to do what he's doing? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=17.76s)]
*  Yes, Alex, the president does have the power to send the military to call up the National Guard [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=23.68s)]
*  in a case of civil unrest, as long as they're not engaging in traditional law enforcement duties. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=30.24s)]
*  As you mentioned, the Posse Comitados Act forbids the military from working as a police department. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=35.92s)]
*  But they can serve in a support role if they are there to observe, if they are there as a show of force, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=42.4s)]
*  in case the president does need to invoke the Insurrection Act. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=50.96s)]
*  If things get out of hand, they are on the ground and ready. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=54.64s)]
*  But just because you can do something legally doesn't always mean you should do something legally. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=58.4s)]
*  That's something I certainly learned as a federal prosecutor. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=62.8s)]
*  And when you've got a governor and a mayor saying, please stay out, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=66.32s)]
*  you're only going to escalate the tensions here on our community. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=69.76s)]
*  You can't help but wonder if that is not part of this show of force, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=73.36s)]
*  an effort to raise this issue in the public's eye. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=76.88s)]
*  And so I worry that they may end up doing more harm than good. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=80.32s)]
*  Yeah, then it's part of the calculus. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=83.44s)]
*  Barbara, let me ask you about the reports of lawyers not being allowed [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  inside the detention facilities to see their clients. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=88.47999999999999s)]
*  Is that illegal? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=91.6s)]
*  Well, they can't be withheld without legal counsel forever. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=94.32s)]
*  But if, you know, it's a Sunday afternoon and they say this is not the right time, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=99.44s)]
*  we don't have the personnel here, you don't have a right to see your lawyer on a 24-7 basis. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=103.84s)]
*  Also, they haven't been charged with a crime. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=109.12s)]
*  And so it isn't that things are occurring in violation of their right to counsel. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=111.36s)]
*  But if they are to have immigration proceedings, they do have a right to a lawyer there. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  And so I think it's a matter of when, not if, they get a chance to see these lawyers. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=120.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  Shaniqua, your reaction to what we're seeing, because Borders R. Tom Homan said he's afraid [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=127.2s)]
*  someone could lose their life due to the unrest in Los Angeles, whether an officer or a protester. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=132.56s)]
*  But does bringing in federal law enforcement just escalate the situation? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=138.72s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=143.92000000000002s)]
*  And, you know, something that I find really interesting about all of this is Republicans [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=145.12s)]
*  talk a lot about states' rights, I guess, except when they don't run the states. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=149.6s)]
*  I mean, they have really defied the wishes of the governor there. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=154.64000000000001s)]
*  And I think all they're looking for is a scene. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=159.36s)]
*  They are going into L.A. and making it really tense. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=162.08s)]
*  They want the protesters to react to them so that they can justify [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=165.76000000000002s)]
*  whatever reaction they have, no matter how over the top it is. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=169.36s)]
*  I mean, we've seen this before in Washington, D.C., in 2020, when protesters were simply trying [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=172.56s)]
*  to bring attention to George Floyd's death. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=178.72000000000003s)]
*  And, you know, Donald Trump sent the National Guard out. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=181.12s)]
*  And so he's trying to get a reaction out of them. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=184.88000000000002s)]
*  But I think the thing that may backfire on him is that he's bringing more attention. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=187.04000000000002s)]
*  More people are probably tuning into the news right now. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=191.28s)]
*  And they're going to start to wonder what is going on. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=194.0s)]
*  They're going to start to hear more that there are people who are being arrested, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=196.08s)]
*  people who are being deported without any due process, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=199.84s)]
*  and start to pay attention to what he's doing. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=202.56s)]
*  And this is going to backfire on him. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=204.56s)]
*  But I just hope it's in enough time that, you know, he can be stopped. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=206.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=210.96s)]
*  Let me just tell viewers what we're seeing to the left of your screen there, guys. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=211.52s)]
*  This is a chopper view of Mariachi Plaza. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=214.08s)]
*  That is in East Los Angeles, specifically Boyle Heights. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=216.64s)]
*  It's about a 30-minute walk or so, maybe a little further, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=219.44s)]
*  depending on the streets that you're going to take, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=222.88s)]
*  to downtown, to where he had seen our colleague David Noriega amid the presence, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=225.76s)]
*  a large presence of law enforcement there. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=230.24s)]
*  So, Carlos, as we keep watching the scene here, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=232.96s)]
*  Holman also said he has not ruled out asking the DOJ to prosecute Mayor Bass [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=236.0s)]
*  and Governor Newsom if they cross a line. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=240.48s)]
*  That line has not been clearly defined yet. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=242.32s)]
*  But how unprecedented would that be? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=245.2s)]
*  And do you think there's any dereliction of duty happening by the California officials here? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=247.36s)]
*  Well, look, I think the administration itself and Mr. Holman have admitted that they have not [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=253.92000000000002s)]
*  violated any laws or been negligent in any way. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=259.04s)]
*  That threat really isn't helpful in thinking about our institutions, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=263.28000000000003s)]
*  the trust and confidence in our government. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=267.6s)]
*  President Trump himself is someone who has complained against weaponizing the government [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=270.08000000000004s)]
*  to attack political adversaries. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=275.28s)]
*  So it really wouldn't make sense. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=277.28s)]
*  But what is clear here, Alex, is that this administration understands [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=279.03999999999996s)]
*  that any day where immigration is leading the news is a day where they are winning. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=283.52s)]
*  This is an issue that the two parties had fought to a draw for a couple decades. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=288.55999999999995s)]
*  During the Biden administration, Democrats lost the public's trust on this issue. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=292.96s)]
*  President Trump knows it, and that is why he tries to raise the volume [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=298.55999999999995s)]
*  every time there's an immigration controversy in our country, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=302.8s)]
*  because they believe and the polls indicate that it's to their advantage. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=306.0s)]
*  Well, Shaniqua, let me pick up on this because a new CBS poll conducted [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  before the events of this weekend in L.A. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=315.04s)]
*  found overall approval for Trump's deportation policy stands at about 54 percent. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=318.08000000000004s)]
*  Forty-two percent say it is making people more safe. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=322.8s)]
*  Thirty percent say less safe. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=325.6s)]
*  Do Democrats have to step carefully here? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=327.6s)]
*  And will these numbers change? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=330.48s)]
*  If the federal response becomes more extreme? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=332.56s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's definitely going to change. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=337.44s)]
*  I mean, Democrats have been, from the beginning of this, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=339.52000000000004s)]
*  have started off pretty tepid. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=342.32s)]
*  I think we're seeing a lot more people speak out. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=344.0s)]
*  And that is because the public led them there. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=346.56s)]
*  People were frustrated, upset, and not okay with what's happening. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=348.64s)]
*  And, you know, that poll also showed a majority of people believe that [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=352.24s)]
*  I don't think Democrats need to tiptoe around anything. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=356.8s)]
*  I think Trump is really, you know, again, he's making a scene [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=369.6s)]
*  and a lot of people are going to start to question what's going on. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=374.0s)]
*  And they're not okay with this. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=376.56s)]
*  We saw this with the Muslim bans in his first term [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=377.68s)]
*  and when he was separating families. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=380.40000000000003s)]
*  He's just playing into what he always does, overstepping, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=382.0s)]
*  and Americans are not going to like it. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=384.88s)]
*  Yeah, and picking up on that, Carlos, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=386.96s)]
*  we have 63% of respondents who say a non-U.S. citizen [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=388.56s)]
*  should get a court hearing before they are deported. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=393.28s)]
*  So what we've seen with the migrants being sent without due process [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=395.84s)]
*  to that prison, for example, in El Salvador, is that crossing a line? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=399.76s)]
*  And do you think we will see a change in sentiment [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=404.8s)]
*  as all of this chaos plays out in the streets? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=408.32s)]
*  Particularly, let's talk about independents [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=412.15999999999997s)]
*  who maybe heretofore had supported President Trump. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=414.16s)]
*  Might they be vulnerable to change now and say, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=417.36s)]
*  we don't like what we're seeing? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=419.92s)]
*  Well, of course, Alex, there is a breaking point somewhere. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=422.40000000000003s)]
*  During the president's first administration, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=425.28000000000003s)]
*  it was the child separation policy, right? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=427.84000000000003s)]
*  When children were separated from their parents, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=430.56s)]
*  they really did lose public support there. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=433.52000000000004s)]
*  But a lot has changed since the first Trump administration. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=436.32000000000005s)]
*  The Biden years really pushed the public to the right on this issue. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=440.08000000000004s)]
*  And I think there's a high degree of tolerance [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=444.0s)]
*  for aggressive immigration enforcement. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=446.48s)]
*  Of course, the administration knows that there is a risk in going too far. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=449.2s)]
*  That's why Kilmar Briego-Garcia is back in the United States [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=453.36s)]
*  and will face charges here. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=456.96s)]
*  And the administration is admitting that they denied his due process. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=459.44s)]
*  Rights made a mistake. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=464.0s)]
*  We're too aggressive. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=465.12s)]
*  However, people want to characterize it. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=466.08s)]
*  So there is a line somewhere here. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=468.64s)]
*  But as we can see from a lot of the polling, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=471.52s)]
*  the public is willing to be very patient with the president [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=474.79999999999995s)]
*  and this administration and the issue of immigration enforcement. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=478.88s)]
*  Barbara, before I let you go, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=485.03999999999996s)]
*  can you quickly comment on Kilmar Briego-Garcia [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=486.24s)]
*  and the charges that are standing against him, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=489.44s)]
*  allegedly, from the administration? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=492.32s)]
*  Are they valid? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=494.0s)]
*  Do you think they have a good case? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=494.79999999999995s)]
*  Are they trying to re-engineer their own actions, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=495.91999999999996s)]
*  sending him to El Salvador? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=499.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I think first there are a couple of things that are clear. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=502.47999999999996s)]
*  One is the Trump administration clearly had the power all along [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=504.79999999999995s)]
*  to bring him back to this country, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=507.68s)]
*  even when they were told by the court to facilitate his return [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=509.2s)]
*  and they said they couldn't do it. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=512.0799999999999s)]
*  I also think it's highly unlikely that Kilmar Briego-Garcia [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=513.68s)]
*  would have been charged with anything [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=516.48s)]
*  if he had not caused this embarrassment for the Trump administration. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=517.84s)]
*  So clearly they dug and looked to see if they could find something. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=520.96s)]
*  It appears that they did. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=523.52s)]
*  I mean, a grand jury has returned an indictment. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=524.3199999999999s)]
*  That's a finding of probable cause of some serious charges [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=526.8s)]
*  for harboring and transporting undocumented immigrants. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=529.84s)]
*  If those charges can be proved, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=532.88s)]
*  then he will be convicted and be punished consequently. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=535.0400000000001s)]
*  But I do think one thing that's important here [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=539.76s)]
*  is that he will get due process in court. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=542.0s)]
*  He has a right to a presumption of innocence. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=544.24s)]
*  He'll have a lawyer. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=547.12s)]
*  He'll have a judge. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=548.08s)]
*  And so instead of just telling us he's a bad guy from the podium, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=549.2s)]
*  now they've got to be put to their proofs. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=552.48s)]
*  And so I think it's a good day for due process. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=554.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAJFfP36AI&t=559.84s)]
