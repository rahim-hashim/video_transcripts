*  Latino. I'm going to do this for them regardless of what the you know what the consequences may be. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  Wow that was NBC's Jacob Soboroff reporting a lot of drama there at Dodger Stadium. Pablo what do [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=127.92s)]
*  you make of it? This is a microcosm of a larger story in which I think people in Los Angeles which [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=134.0s)]
*  happens to be about 50% Hispanic Latino are wondering who are these people coming for us? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=140.48s)]
*  Are these police officers? Are they ICE agents? Are they Homeland Security? When you have people [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=147.28s)]
*  who are emerging from unmarked vans sometimes who are wearing masks it's just hard to tell most [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=152.48s)]
*  generously which governmental entity is trying to arrest you and potentially as we've seen [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=156.88s)]
*  historically now disappear you to places where you don't know. You don't know what's going to [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=163.36s)]
*  happen to you and so sports Mica the thing about sports of course is that Dodger Stadium beyond [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  being a beautiful vision of a multicultural America in the most real ways I don't mean to [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=174.56s)]
*  be maudlin about that it's just actually what it is. You have a deeply diverse population that [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=179.76000000000002s)]
*  reflects the surrounding areas in a way that is rare in sports. When you have people encroaching [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=184.72000000000003s)]
*  upon that you have a metaphor and a reality being compromised. The idea that wait a minute we can [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=189.52s)]
*  still gather safely and as Americans and that's what's so fragile right now. It's a microcosm of [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=198.16000000000003s)]
*  that feeling too. David so we saw ICE actually tweeted that it wasn't them but we know that the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=205.04000000000002s)]
*  reporting is that it was the masks it was ICE. So talk to us about what this looks like what the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=213.36s)]
*  optics here are of an agency saying that they're not there but then actually being there. Look [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=220.32000000000002s)]
*  you know we have a sort of healthy sense as a country of libertarianism in that we don't want [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=226.96s)]
*  the government over encroaching in our spaces in our cultural spaces in our homes. It's why [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=233.76000000000002s)]
*  getting a warrant and all of that stuff is so deeply embedded in our constitution and even [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=241.35999999999999s)]
*  before that. So what I'm interested to see is how the administration's aggressive tactics [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=246.79999999999998s)]
*  where they're just because they don't make clear what they're doing and maybe that's part of the [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=255.92s)]
*  strategy. They appear to many people to just be roaming where they think illegal immigrants are [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=260.8s)]
*  and they're judging who they might be based on what they look like and that is just something [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=268.4s)]
*  that is so un-American. I mean I'm a Cold War kid and we would watch movies about what it was like [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=273.2s)]
*  in the Soviet Union there's always some guy with an accent saying show me your papers and it's just [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=278.56s)]
*  not what we're about. At the same time I will say because the federal government has failed to do [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=282.96s)]
*  anything about immigration both reforming legal immigration and securing the border there's been [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=288.08s)]
*  a huge frustration that has even crept into the Hispanic community. We saw all of the border [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=294.72s)]
*  counties in Texas and the Rio Grande Valley go Republican and if you talk to Hispanics [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=300.56s)]
*  in those counties a big reason why they voted for Trump over Harris is because they felt like the [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=306.24s)]
*  Biden administration wasn't securing the border and in fact many illegal immigrants would say at [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=312.8s)]
*  times like even we're for securing the border under the assumption that they're not coming after us [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=318.88000000000005s)]
*  because we're working. So now do the optics of this do the politics of this change because of [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=323.44s)]
*  how the administration is carrying this out? I just want to mention though there was a border [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=330.32s)]
*  a bipartisan piece of border legislation that was killed by Republicans. That is very true which is [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=334.96s)]
*  but it's been a bipartisan failure Democrats and Republicans both they all you know and Republicans [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=340.8s)]
*  have talked about securing the border for a long time they haven't done anything about e-verify they [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=346.96s)]
*  haven't done anything to make legal immigration more orderly to make the asylum process more [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=351.92s)]
*  orderly they haven't appropriated money for judges so that you could figure out who people are quickly [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=357.44s)]
*  either they can stay or they have to go this is everybody's failure. But on that right Mika I [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=362.56s)]
*  always think about how the theater of this the theater of enforcement has been so visible when [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=367.92s)]
*  it comes to what they're actually doing to address what David's saying how many people are they [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=374.72s)]
*  actually deporting how are they actually solving the problems in a pragmatic policy way we're not [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=379.28s)]
*  seeing that seemingly we're seeing the theater and this seems like to me theater again. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=385.35999999999996s)]
*  Yeah I don't disagree with that and senior writer for the dispatch David Drucker thanks for your [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=390.96s)]
*  help all morning good to see you. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=395.44s)]
*  you [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFP-Ut_u28&t=409.28s)]
