# As SCOTUS considers porn access, an argument on why it's bad for society
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M)
*  Our the US Supreme Court is expected to rule next month on a case that could [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=0.0s)]
*  drastically change access to pornography in America. After hearing arguments [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=4.32s)]
*  earlier this term, the justices will likely decide on the legality of a Texas law requiring [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=10.16s)]
*  age verification for porn viewers. The law is being challenged by a non-profit organization [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=16.88s)]
*  advocating on behalf of the industry. The Free Speech Coalition argues the law violates the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=23.68s)]
*  free speech rights of adults who want to access mature content. Joining us now, senior fellow at [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=29.52s)]
*  the American Enterprise Institute, Christine Emba. She's the author of the book titled, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=37.2s)]
*  Rethinking Sex, a Provocation. She also wrote a recent piece for the New York Times entitled, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=43.44s)]
*  The Delusion of Porn's Harmlessness. Also with us for this discussion, special correspondent at [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=49.68s)]
*  Fannity Fair and host of the Fast Politics podcast, Molly John Fast. Good to have you both. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=56.16s)]
*  So, Christine, I'm so glad that you are diving into this topic. If you could tell us what the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=63.68s)]
*  delusion is that, you know, porn doesn't hurt anybody as long as it doesn't hurt anybody, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=72.8s)]
*  but it really ultimately does have long-lasting effects on people who view it a lot. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=78.96s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. I mean, it's not a topic that I necessarily love writing about myself, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=84.88s)]
*  but I do feel that it's important. In this moment, it seems as though there is sort of a mass [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=90.24s)]
*  delusion, especially among people who want to consider themselves, you know, well-educated, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  modern sort of liberal thinkers, that pornography is a private affair, that it is harmless [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=100.96s)]
*  entertainment for adults, and that it's not doing anything to our society, that, you know, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=107.6s)]
*  private things are kept private. But I think that most Americans, and honestly most individuals, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=112.8s)]
*  know themselves that porn is not good for us. It hasn't been good for our society. It's certainly [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  not good for the young people who are watching it almost constantly and for whom it has served as [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=124.8s)]
*  sort of their first education about sexuality and the way that they should relate romantically with [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=130.56s)]
*  others. Well, and I want to talk about that in a minute, because that's so important, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=135.44s)]
*  especially for those of us who have daughters, for those daughters' friends, and we've been [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=142.24s)]
*  hearing about this for years. But you made, I think, a really important point that sometimes [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=152.32000000000002s)]
*  people on the left who will write about how damaging pornography is don't want to walk through the door [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=158.08s)]
*  and say, this is bad, because it goes against sort of their feeling that people should be making [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=164.96s)]
*  decisions. You say in that vacuum you have people on the right, you have religious, those that are, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=173.04s)]
*  people of faith that are going out and saying this, but unfortunately gets too quickly discounted [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=181.92s)]
*  by a lead. So talk about why it's important for people not just on the right, but those in the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=189.44s)]
*  center and the left to really talk about the harm that this does to people individually and society [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=195.11999999999998s)]
*  as a whole. Yeah, I mean we really need to talk about it, because only by talking about it can we [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=200.72s)]
*  figure out how to address it. You know, in many cases pornography is sort of, first of all, it's [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=206.0s)]
*  a vast cultural product that kind of infuses our media, infuses how we talk to each other, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=211.83999999999997s)]
*  infuses our politics, changes the way that men and women relate. But because we, and I say this [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=217.04s)]
*  sort of general, we feel sort of nervous about embracing it or rather embracing the conversation [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=223.28s)]
*  about it in public. We just sort of allow it to to shape our imaginations, to shape our relationships [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=229.2s)]
*  without countering it in any way. So I think one of the best examples here about what the fear of [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=236.0s)]
*  talking about it does, keeping this delusion of harmlessness, is that we don't educate young [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=242.88s)]
*  people about the fact that porn is not real, the fact that watching false representations [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=249.12s)]
*  of sexuality, especially porn today often focuses on misogynistic attitudes towards women. There's [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=255.84s)]
*  a lot of violence. It makes the porn that older generations watch to look like, as one girl put it, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=262.08s)]
*  an American Girl Doll catalog. This does shape how we interact with people. It shapes how young men [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=268.56s)]
*  treat young women. It shapes how young women feel about dating young men. And this has implications [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=274.56s)]
*  for our future, for a loneliness crisis, for falling levels of dating and relationships. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=280.88s)]
*  But if we don't talk about it, we are not acknowledging the harms that it causes. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=287.6s)]
*  And for people that don't have younger children or children that are of an age to date, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=293.12s)]
*  etc., they don't understand how much things have changed over the past five years, the past ten [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=298.96000000000004s)]
*  years. You and I were reading an article a couple of years ago that we sent around and were shocked [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=304.72s)]
*  by that some young men have to take Viagra because they're aroused by what they see on the screen, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=310.24s)]
*  but not in real life. So it's having an effect on these individuals. You're seeing these [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=318.96000000000004s)]
*  headlines that we're sending about how it ruined people's lives. But it's undermining society as a [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=324.48s)]
*  whole, like the dating culture, everything. Two things come to mind. Phones, first of all, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=331.28000000000003s)]
*  which now has the possibility of young children getting access to porn by mistake even. COVID, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=337.36s)]
*  which had everybody locked up with their technology. And we talk, Christine, about [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=345.76s)]
*  the harms of porn. I would say that isn't it fair to say it's addictive in a very dangerous way, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=352.08s)]
*  and it can pull people in and cut them completely off from the rest of the world and make it very, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=360.08s)]
*  very difficult to help them. And I'm trying to think of a parallel. And would a fair parallel [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=368.56s)]
*  be like alcohol? It's legal. You can drink it. But if you drink it every day, all day, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=375.12s)]
*  you will be very sick and become addicted. Right. I mean, and we're open to saying that about alcohol. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=381.52s)]
*  We're open to saying this about cigarettes. These are things that are available. You can do this if [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=388.08s)]
*  you want, but just know that it's not good for you. There's not necessarily a safe and ethical [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=392.32s)]
*  version of smoking that we would recommend to children. But the points that you brought up are [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=397.28000000000003s)]
*  really key about how it warps relationships in the real world. So first of all, you're right. I [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=402.24s)]
*  think smartphones are a huge changer of how pornography works in this moment. Because unlike [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=408.48s)]
*  in the past, there are kids with smartphones who have pornography on their phones and accessible to [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=414.16s)]
*  them at all hours of the day or night. You can be watching porn on the bus. You could be watching it [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=419.36s)]
*  in school. There's sort of no way to escape from this access. And then there are a lot of kids who, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=424.32s)]
*  because of the ease of access and they're sort of always on internet life, stumble upon porn [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=430.4s)]
*  unawares when they're not necessarily ready to see something like that. The first age of porn [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=436.15999999999997s)]
*  exposure in the U.S. is something in the late or rather in the early tweens between 11 and 13 for [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=441.12s)]
*  most kids. Yeah, Molly, that can't be overstated here. The fact that it's just so readily accessible [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=448.08s)]
*  now. Porn is not hard to get anymore. And in fact, it could be a child, you know, innocently looking [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=452.56s)]
*  on lines and out on a line or social media site and the algorithms eventually get them there. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=457.68s)]
*  Yes, but I'm curious about the political calculus of this decision. So Trump has made huge inroads or [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=463.6s)]
*  has made some inroads, I think is more fair with the younger people. So this doesn't strike me as [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=471.12s)]
*  a hugely popular move there. Can you talk me through some of the political calculations? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=478.32s)]
*  Yeah, you know, it's interesting trying to figure out whether it is popular or not in this moment. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=483.92s)]
*  I actually think that older adults tend to underestimate the sort of the level of despair [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=490.48s)]
*  that pornography and sort of a broken sexual landscape has brought to younger generations. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=496.88s)]
*  So in polling in the in the last in the 2024 election, actually most Americans were in favor [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=503.84000000000003s)]
*  of some kind of age restrictions or some ways of making porn more difficult to access for younger [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=512.32s)]
*  people. The only group that was actually sort of firmly opposed to this was yes, young men. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=518.96s)]
*  And that is a group that Trump has, you know, tried and kind of succeeded in in courting in this [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=524.72s)]
*  moment. But at the same time, if you like are looking at the conversations that young people [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=530.08s)]
*  are having online, if you're looking at, you know, what really popular, for instance, male [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=534.72s)]
*  podcasters like a Theo Vaughn or Joe Rogan are saying they're much more open in this moment [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=539.36s)]
*  about saying that like, hey, I've struggled with pornography, this actually isn't good for me. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=545.04s)]
*  Like, I kind of wish my world was not suffused with this. So I think younger generations are [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=549.36s)]
*  actually more awake to the harms of pornography and are more open to seeing pornography become [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=554.96s)]
*  sort of less pervasive than, you know, older voters, older adults might give them credit for. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=562.5600000000001s)]
*  Well, the new piece is online now for The New York Times. Senior Fellow at the American Enterprise [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=569.36s)]
*  Institute, Christine Emba, thank you. We really appreciate your writing this piece and coming on [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=575.52s)]
*  the show. Thank you very much. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8y7hubtl2M&t=580.5600000000001s)]
