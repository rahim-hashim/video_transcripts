# 'Truly immoral' legislation: House Dem rails against tax cuts in spending bill
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [July 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE)
*  One of the Democrats who spoke out overnight on the House floor was Congressman Brendan [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=0.0s)]
*  Boyle of Pennsylvania. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=4.62s)]
*  He's the ranking member of the Budget Committee. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=6.34s)]
*  Here's a bit of what he had to say. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=8.84s)]
*  The decision we have been entrusted by the American people to make will have ramifications [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=11.540000000000001s)]
*  for millions of our fellow Americans and indeed for our country for decades to come. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=19.0s)]
*  There may not be a lot of people able to watch at 4.05 in the morning, but in just a few [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=27.06s)]
*  short hours some of them on Medicaid will be waking up and turning on the news to find [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=33.3s)]
*  out if what we did here tonight means they're about to lose it. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=40.62s)]
*  The kids who rely on SNAP, the Nutrition Assistance Program, they may not quite understand it [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=45.78s)]
*  but make no mistake about it, what we're about to do in the next few minutes here [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=53.62s)]
*  will have a profound effect on their lives. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=57.699999999999996s)]
*  And Congressman Boyle joins us now. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=62.459999999999994s)]
*  Congressman, appreciate you stepping out of the chamber for a moment during Leader Jeffrey's [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=64.97999999999999s)]
*  speech. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=68.66s)]
*  I guess you figure you have some time still to come talk to us before that wraps up and [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=69.66s)]
*  the vote commences. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=73.02s)]
*  We heard your case against, part of it anyway, this massive bill. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=74.5s)]
*  We were just talking to Governor Andy Beshear of Kentucky who was passing on what he feels [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=78.5s)]
*  like are going to be the devastating impacts of this legislation on the ground in his state. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=83.38000000000001s)]
*  What else do you expect to see, let's say, in your district? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=88.94s)]
*  Bring it down to the ground level of your constituents if and when this bill does pass. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=92.10000000000001s)]
*  Well, good to be with you. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=97.34s)]
*  I've been up all throughout the night, so have my fellow Democrats, and we've been doing [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=99.74000000000001s)]
*  everything we possibly can to stop this bill because the ramifications are truly awful [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=103.34s)]
*  for people in my district but throughout this country. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=109.76s)]
*  CBO confirmed that 17 million Americans will lose their health care if this bill in just [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=112.74000000000001s)]
*  a few moments passes and becomes law. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=117.66s)]
*  That would represent the biggest loss of health care in American history. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=120.66s)]
*  There are other ramifications, as I was pointing out in my speech on the floor, through the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=124.06s)]
*  middle of the night, that another 4.5 million kids would lose SNAP. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=128.94s)]
*  That is vital. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=134.1s)]
*  I mean, my wife happens to be an elementary school teacher in a school that has a very [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=135.1s)]
*  high population of students that rely on that program. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=140.54s)]
*  We will have hungrier kids going to school in America if this bill becomes law. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=144.57999999999998s)]
*  We think of all of these cuts to Medicaid, to Medicare, the ACA, to food assistance, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=149.73999999999998s)]
*  and toward what end? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=155.26s)]
*  To pay for tax cuts, more than $5 trillion worth of tax cuts that mostly go to the top [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=156.94s)]
*  1%. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=162.26s)]
*  It's truly an immoral piece of legislation. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=163.26s)]
*  When you talk privately, Congressman, you've got a bunch of friends on the Hill who are [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=167.4s)]
*  Republicans, presumably. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=170.60000000000002s)]
*  When you speak to them privately, they know what this bill is going to do to the deficit. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=172.56s)]
*  They know what it's going to do to rural hospitals in some of their states or urban hospitals, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=177.52s)]
*  depending on what kind of district they represent. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=182.92000000000002s)]
*  What do they tell you behind the scenes about how they get to yes on that? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=185.72000000000003s)]
*  You know, it is amazing. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=189.32000000000002s)]
*  I really wish that what some Republicans say in private could become public, because it's [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  always, you know, in whispered, hushed tones, I don't agree with Donald Trump. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=198.0s)]
*  I don't think this is good legislation. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=203.84s)]
*  I'm concerned about deficit and debt. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=205.68s)]
*  But then they always look around and say, shh, don't tell anyone that I said that. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=208.04s)]
*  The reality is, so many of my Republican colleagues are deathly afraid of Donald Trump. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=211.95999999999998s)]
*  Just yesterday, or I'm losing track of what day it is now, but maybe about 36 hours ago, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=218.2s)]
*  there was a markup in the Rules Committee, and you had a couple of self-described fiscal [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=225.72s)]
*  hawks on the Republican side vote against this legislation because of its massive increase [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=230.51999999999998s)]
*  in the deficit and debt. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=236.6s)]
*  Well, now here they are about to vote for the bill, even though not one word of the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=238.32s)]
*  bill has changed. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=242.48s)]
*  They call it the Freedom Caucus, the HFC. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=243.92s)]
*  Fiscally, I think it stands for the House Folding Caucus. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=247.12s)]
*  I think, Congressman, it is stunning to see some of those more fiscally conservative members [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=251.92000000000002s)]
*  fold and actually vote for this, having covered them for so long myself. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=256.04s)]
*  You, of course, are one of their colleagues. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=259.64s)]
*  I also thought it was a bit odd to hear that moderates in the House hoped that the Senate [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=261.04s)]
*  would make some moderating changes. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=265.6s)]
*  They made this bill more conservative. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=267.36s)]
*  And then, of course, you had senators hoping that moderates in the House could make this [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=269.28000000000003s)]
*  more moderate. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=272.36s)]
*  And ultimately, the bill didn't change, and here we are. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=273.36s)]
*  The thing that I end up hearing so much when we talk to stakeholders and advocates, I talked, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=276.44s)]
*  for example, to two kids and who are also podcast hosts with Down syndrome about how [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=280.96s)]
*  this would impact their care. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=285.15999999999997s)]
*  And the words that they kept using for me is, I'm so scared. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=287.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm scared of the uncertainty. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=290.12s)]
*  I'm scared of what this means when I lose the care that I rely on. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=291.32s)]
*  When we talk about how this impact knows no politics and no party, what do you tell constituents [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=294.76s)]
*  who hear what you're saying about, all right, we're going to make this an issue in the midterm, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=300.2s)]
*  but they're scared now and they're going to be hurt now. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=303.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=305.82s)]
*  And, you know, I really I'm so glad you brought up this point because the number of calls [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=306.82s)]
*  that we're getting to our office, the number of text messages I'm getting from just personal [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=311.7s)]
*  friends saying, you know, my mother is in a nursing home and she's on Medicaid. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=316.1s)]
*  And now I'm truly scared of what's going to happen. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=320.5s)]
*  There are some 500 nursing homes that are saying they're at risk to close in the United [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=322.5s)]
*  States if this bill becomes law. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=328.3s)]
*  There's another 300 or so rural hospitals that are at risk. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=330.5s)]
*  The reality is the face of those specifically on Medicaid is not just an urban one. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=335.26s)]
*  It is urban, rural. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=340.92s)]
*  It is entering suburb. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=342.54s)]
*  It is young and it is old. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=344.02s)]
*  It's white, black, Latino, Asian-American. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=346.62s)]
*  It's truly a wide swath of Americana. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=350.06s)]
*  And I think the other challenge here, too, as much as this bill is likely passing today [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=354.7s)]
*  and the midterms we know are over a year and a half away at this point, sustaining people's [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=359.22s)]
*  mindset and consciousness around this issue is going to be important and potentially difficult. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=364.82s)]
*  But then also, how do you do that when a lot of these cuts might not actually take effect [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=370.02000000000004s)]
*  until 2026, 2027, points where people might have already gone to the ballot box? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=374.5s)]
*  How do you sustain this? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=379.86s)]
*  Yeah, well, two points on this. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=381.1s)]
*  First, the current polling shows this is already the most unpopular major piece of legislation [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=382.78000000000003s)]
*  in my lifetime. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=389.78s)]
*  It is truly extraordinary just how horrifically bad these numbers are when it comes to how [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=390.86s)]
*  voters feel today about this piece of legislation. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=398.18s)]
*  You asked, though, OK, what about the next year and three months, four months? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=401.34s)]
*  How do Democrats sustain that? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=405.1s)]
*  I would point out to exactly eight years ago, Republicans spent most of 2017 trying and [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=406.98s)]
*  ultimately failing to repeal the Affordable Care Act. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=413.3s)]
*  And yet, the following year, the fact that the ACA actually wasn't repealed, that didn't [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=416.98s)]
*  end up saving them the subsequent November when they lost a total of 41 House seats and [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=423.46s)]
*  lost control of the House of Representatives. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=429.94s)]
*  I do believe and I can I'm pretty confident making this prediction right now, pass will [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=432.26s)]
*  be prologue. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=436.7s)]
*  There are many of my House Republican colleagues right now who are just about to guarantee [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=437.86s)]
*  they're going to lose their elections next November because of this vote they're about [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=442.82s)]
*  to cast. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=446.58s)]
*  We just saw Congressman Mike Lawler strolling behind you, one of those in a swing district [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=448.5s)]
*  who's about to take a vote himself. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=452.58s)]
*  Ranking member of the House Budget Committee, Democratic Congressman Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=454.46000000000004s)]
*  will let you get back into the chamber. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=458.78000000000003s)]
*  Appreciate you taking some time with us this morning. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=460.42s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=463.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waCFEIYrckE&t=464.42s)]
