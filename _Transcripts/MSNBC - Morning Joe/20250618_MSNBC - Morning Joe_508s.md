# 'Serious economic consequences': Canadian tourism has dropped in my state, says governor
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ)
*  Let's get to that. President Trump met with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=0.0s)]
*  on Monday during the G7 summit. The two leaders reportedly committed to pursuing [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=4.32s)]
*  a trade deal within the next month. Also on Monday, Democratic Governor Maura Healey of [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=9.36s)]
*  Massachusetts hosted a meeting in Boston with other governors from the Northeast and Canadian [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  premiers for their own strategic talks. And Governor Healey joins us now. Maura, it's great [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=21.52s)]
*  to see you. So tell us about these conversations and what you hope to accomplish. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=28.24s)]
*  Yeah, well great to be with you. And I just want to say, Brad Marshon, the Boston Bruin, also Nova [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=36.16s)]
*  Scotian from Canada, now a Stanley Cup winner once again. So not all is lost for our Canadian friends. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=42.239999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=50.08s)]
*  This is serious stuff. You know, everyone knows that Canada is our greatest trading partner, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=52.08s)]
*  and that's certainly true in the Northeast. And given what Donald Trump was doing with tariffs [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=58.88s)]
*  and other things, I thought it was important to get a group of us together. So I invited Governor [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=64.64s)]
*  Hoco from New York, the other New England governors, to meet with Canadian premiers in Boston the other [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=69.76s)]
*  day to talk about how we can move forward with our own relationships, our own partnerships around [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=75.76s)]
*  trade, around energy supply, around tourism, for example. And so we had a really good conversation [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=82.48s)]
*  in Boston. We're going to continue that. It was important that, to me, that we affirm Canada is an [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=89.60000000000001s)]
*  ally here and we are stronger working together. I hope and would hope that Donald Trump cleans up [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=97.04s)]
*  the mess he made and reaches a deal with Mark Carney. But in the interim, we can't wait and we [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=104.56s)]
*  need to do everything that we can as governors to make sure that that relationship is made stronger [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=110.48s)]
*  and that we're working to protect our residents and our businesses and our local economies. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=117.2s)]
*  So, Governor, speaking of local economies, I've heard governors from Florida to Maine, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  business leaders, excuse me, and community leaders from Florida to Maine, very concerned about the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=130.0s)]
*  loss of Canadian tourism. I know several people from Canada who have left Florida, sold their homes, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=136.72s)]
*  sold their condos, moved out of Florida and gone back to Canada. I'm curious, is Massachusetts [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=145.28s)]
*  feeling right now any sting from some of the back and forth between President Trump and Canada over [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=153.84s)]
*  the past six months? What's happening with tourism? Is it slowing down for you like it is for other [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=164.08s)]
*  states? Absolutely. Absolutely. And Joe, that was the consensus of all the governors. We've seen [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=169.60000000000002s)]
*  drop in our states of between 20 and 60 percent. 20 and 60 percent drop in Canadian tourism in our [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=176.88s)]
*  states alone, and we're only in June. So that's really devastating. I also know that Canadian [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=184.88s)]
*  flights, people into and out of Boston from Canada are also down. We've heard the stories [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=193.27999999999997s)]
*  about Florida. This is a serious issue for us, and it's real. The feeling on the part of Canadians [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=198.88s)]
*  that took tremendous offense, of course, to being labeled the 51st state by our president, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=207.04s)]
*  are making decisions to spend their tourism dollars elsewhere. So part of what we were trying [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=213.04s)]
*  to do the other day, Joe, is just to say, hey, we're still open for business. Remember, we're [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=218.55999999999997s)]
*  your friends. We're your neighbors. We have such close cultural and familial ties with the Canadians [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=223.27999999999997s)]
*  here in the Northeast, and we wanted to do everything that we could to cement that. But [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=229.44s)]
*  that's a big problem. Tourism is a huge problem economically. I'll tell you the other issue. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=234.48s)]
*  We're trying to build housing here in the Northeast. All of our lumber comes from Canada. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  The tariffs are raising the cost of building housing in my state and in states around the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=243.76s)]
*  Northeast. And the last point on energy, what he's done with tariffs, we estimate that people's [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=248.56s)]
*  home heating and gas bills are going to go up an additional two and a half billion dollars over the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=254.72s)]
*  next few years. That's what folks in New England are going to be forced to pay. Donald Trump is [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=261.2s)]
*  taxing us an additional two and a half billion dollars with his Canadian tariffs on energy [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=266.24s)]
*  alone. And so, you know, serious economic consequences for our residents, for our [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=273.2s)]
*  businesses, and for the regional economy. So, Governor, what impact has all of that had on [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=279.68s)]
*  Massachusetts business, if any, that plus immigration raids in the state of Massachusetts, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=286.32s)]
*  affecting employment? What impact has it had? Yeah. Well, look, you know, Mike, I'm somebody who grew up [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=291.28s)]
*  waitressing at a coastal town, and I could tell you the hits to hospitality in Massachusetts, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=298.48s)]
*  hotels, restaurants, numbers are down with Canadian visits dropping. And that means we're looking at [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=305.03999999999996s)]
*  lost jobs as servers and staff get laid off because, you know, they're not bringing in what they did. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=312.0s)]
*  That kind of thing hurts a lot. You talk to suppliers. I convened a number of our [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=318.64s)]
*  manufacturers recently around the state. And, you know, you think about a lot of the materials and [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=323.68s)]
*  raw materials that come from Canada. Aluminum, for example. We've got a big craft beer industry here. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=328.8s)]
*  Where do you think our cans come from? This hurts. And people are seeing the consequences, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=334.88s)]
*  both in terms of end users, consumers paying more for these goods, but also these companies [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=340.16s)]
*  can't make it work with the cost of their supplies increasing. They just can't make the math work. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=347.04s)]
*  And that means layoffs here in Massachusetts and around the region. And it's just so—the [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=353.28000000000003s)]
*  thing that's so upsetting is, you know, we've got any number of things we're trying to manage in the [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=359.68s)]
*  world and deal with, especially as governors right now with this big, awful, terrible bill out there. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=363.44000000000005s)]
*  That's going to gut, you know, funding for our nursing homes and our rural hospitals. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=370.08s)]
*  And then to have to deal with a president who has effectively put a tax on all of our businesses, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=374.24s)]
*  all of our residents and consumers through these tariffs, by the way, with our best friend and ally, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=381.28s)]
*  you know, it's just—it's ludicrous. So as governors, we figured, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=387.84s)]
*  let's see what we can do. Let's see what we can work out for our own deals and our own relationships. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=391.36s)]
*  You know, what can we do to have a cable come from the north and eastern Canadian provinces [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=396.88s)]
*  down into New England to bring us the energy that we need? You know, how can we work out deals around [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=403.36s)]
*  tourism and trade, even if, you know, the president can't get his act together with the prime minister? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=409.44s)]
*  This is the attitude I think we need to have right now, because we've got to forge ahead and make [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=416.48s)]
*  things work for our residents and make things work for our local economies. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=421.92s)]
*  Right. It is so important. And it's so important to have a positive attitude. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=427.04s)]
*  And speaking of positive attitudes and trade, I want to get you thrown into the middle of [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=431.2s)]
*  the biggest controversy in Boston right now. Were the Red Sox—did they make the right move [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=436.48s)]
*  in trading Rafi-Defers to San Francisco? I was sorry to see Rafi-Defers go. You know, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=442.88s)]
*  it reminds me of Mookie Betts a few years ago. Michael, remember this. You know, we're [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=450.16s)]
*  Red Sox fans, Red Sox Nation. We always hope for the best. And, you know, they've got [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=456.72s)]
*  months to go and a lot of games to play. We need Bregman back and healthy. So, you know, go Sox. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=462.96000000000004s)]
*  But Devers is a great player, and I appreciate the contributions he made here. How's that? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=471.20000000000005s)]
*  All right. Maybe we'll see you at a game. Democratic Governor Maura Healey of Massachusetts, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=476.24s)]
*  thank you so much for coming on the show this morning. Great to be with you. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrpqKAv-efQ&t=481.2s)]
