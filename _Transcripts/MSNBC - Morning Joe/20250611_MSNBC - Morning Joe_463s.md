# ‘Brazen abuse of power’: Gov. Newsom slams Trump for ‘illegally’ deploying National Guard troops
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM)
*  We begin once again out West where tensions are running high and a couple of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=0.0s)]
*  Narratives are playing out here at the same time. Yeah [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=6.48s)]
*  And a curfew is now in place in downtown Los Angeles after those clashes between protesters and law enforcement [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=9.4s)]
*  Mayor Karen Bass ordered the curfew last night saying it will quote stop bad actors who are taking advantage of the president's chaotic [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=15.6s)]
*  Escalation mayor Bass says she expects the curfew to be in place for several days [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=24.04s)]
*  There have been hundreds of arrests since Friday. It all comes as the Trump administration has activated 700 Marines and 4,000 [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=28.12s)]
*  Members of the National Guard there in LA the troops have been helping federal immigration agents carry out raids across the country a move [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=35.92s)]
*  That is expected to cost about a hundred and thirty four million dollars for 60 days of operations [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  California has filed a lawsuit seeking to block the Trump administration from activating those troops [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=50.08s)]
*  Federal judge is set to hear that case tomorrow [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=56.44s)]
*  Meanwhile governor Newsom slammed President Trump in a formal address last night as we heard a minute ago [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=59.08s)]
*  criticizing the president for federalizing the National Guard and deploying Marines to LA and accusing him of [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=64.92s)]
*  Fanning the flames of the protests Newsom also described Trump's actions as an assault on democracy while issuing a warning to other states [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=71.2s)]
*  Donald Trump without consulting [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=81.12s)]
*  California law enforcement leaders [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=84.36s)]
*  Commandeered two thousand of our state's National Guard members to deploy on our streets [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=86.52000000000001s)]
*  Illegally and for no reason this brazen abuse of power by a sitting president inflamed a combustible situation [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  Putting our people our officers and even our National Guard at risk [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=100.04s)]
*  That's when the downward spiral began [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=105.12s)]
*  He doubled down on his dangerous National Guard deployment by fanning the flames even harder [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=107.64s)]
*  And the president he did it on purpose [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=113.80000000000001s)]
*  This isn't just about protests here in Los Angeles [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=117.84s)]
*  When Donald Trump sought blanket authority to commandeer the National Guard he made that order apply to every state in this nation [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=121.72s)]
*  This is about all of us. This is about you [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  California may be first but it clearly will not end here other states are next democracy is next [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=133.72s)]
*  Democracy is under assault before our eyes this moment we have feared has arrived [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=141.12s)]
*  Joining us now from Los Angeles is NBC News correspondent Camila Bernal Camila. Good morning. We spoke at this time yesterday [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=147.4s)]
*  Things had calmed a bit. What was the situation overnight particularly with this? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=154.16s)]
*  Curfew of a certain area relatively small area of Los Angeles put into effect [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=159.12s)]
*  Hey, Willie. Yeah, things calm because that curfew is still in effect for another three hours or so here in Los Angeles [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=163.20000000000002s)]
*  But we did see a number of arrests after that curfew went into effect at 8 p.m. Local time last night a huge law enforcement [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=170.08s)]
*  Presence essentially getting everyone off the streets last night [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=178.56s)]
*  And like you mentioned Karen Bass really pointing out that LA is about 500 square miles [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=182.56s)]
*  And you're only getting that curfew in about one square mile of this city [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=189.6s)]
*  So that should give you some perspective as to how large these protests are in comparison to all of Los Angeles [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=194.28s)]
*  There's been a large law enforcement presence not just last night during the curfew [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=200.88s)]
*  But really throughout the entire day in the last couple of days [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=205.2s)]
*  largely made up of [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=208.92s)]
*  State officials and the local police department here and they have been pushing protesters out of the way [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=210.56s)]
*  Essentially when they go into the 101 freeway for example, and we are getting an updated number of those arrests [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=217.76s)]
*  They started out Saturday with just 27 arrests then on Sunday 40 arrests then on Monday [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=224.79999999999998s)]
*  114 and then yesterday before that curfew went into effect they had arrested a hundred and ninety seven people [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=230.79999999999998s)]
*  So you're seeing those numbers increasing we're expecting more because of that curfew [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=237.24s)]
*  But officials saying you're not going to be able to go on the 101 highway [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=242.22s)]
*  You're not going to be able to vandalize and create problem within the city of Los Angeles officials saying [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=245.67999999999998s)]
*  They're going to continue to look at tape and prosecute people hold people accountable if they are [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=252.16s)]
*  Putting that graffiti all over the streets of LA [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=258.32s)]
*  That's one of the biggest problems that authorities want to get a handle of and it's why in part why they put this curfew in place [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=261.15999999999997s)]
*  They're also telling protesters that if you're vandalizing and looting you're not standing up for migrants [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=269.2s)]
*  Those were the words of Karen Bass [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=274.48s)]
*  and then of course there's this political fallout in this political fight between Karen Bass and [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=276.8s)]
*  Gavin Newsom against the president and the two leaders here in California saying that the president has escalated this has [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=282.71999999999997s)]
*  Put fuel to this fire and they say there are two simple reasons as to why this has escalated one being the raids and [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=290.12s)]
*  The immigration agents going into local businesses going into schools [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=299.15999999999997s)]
*  For example the governor is saying there were unmarked vehicles at a school and saying that children are afraid to go to their own [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=303.8s)]
*  Graduation and then the other aspect is of course the National Guard the Marines people on the ground here not wanting to see that and that [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=310.2s)]
*  Creating escalations and tensions here in Los Angeles [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=316.88s)]
*  But I do want to point out that the day yesterday and did very peacefully there was a vigil [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=320.44s)]
*  Taking place with interfaith leaders and a lot of people just wanting this to be about the migrants this to be about the central issue [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=326.16s)]
*  And not about the violence and what you're seeing when things escalate between protesters and police officers willing [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=333.54s)]
*  Camila depending on where you get your information you're getting two very different stories of what's happening in the streets of Los Angeles [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=341.16s)]
*  Right now mayor bass governor Newsom saying they're mostly peaceful [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=347.28000000000003s)]
*  There are some bad actors who yes are committing violence and damage and they should be arrested and prosecuted [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=351.04s)]
*  Everyone agrees on that I think [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=357.88s)]
*  But then if you watch other channels, it's it's chaos in the streets [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=360.0s)]
*  And if you listen to the president United States, it's chaos on the streets him seizing on a couple of clips played on a loop [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=363.68s)]
*  That he's been talking about [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=369.6s)]
*  So you're there you're covering these protests. You've got sources on the ground. What is the truth? What are these protests actually look like? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=371.2s)]
*  Yeah, there is some aspect of chaos [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=379.2s)]
*  But it's relatively small in comparison to Los Angeles and in comparison to the protesters [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=381.59999999999997s)]
*  You're seeing so many members of law enforcement almost in comparison to these protesters [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=387.88s)]
*  So once these ones that want to escalate things and want to create trouble [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=393.71999999999997s)]
*  Start doing so that's when you of course have the cameras already in present and capture a lot of these images that essentially get blown [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=399.68s)]
*  Up and get there's this narrative of LA is on fire and it's not that is not the case [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=407.6s)]
*  It's a very small area things were getting a lot more calm and a lot more peaceful yesterday [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=413.5s)]
*  But what mayor bass and governor Gavin Newsom are saying is yes things are getting more peaceful [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=419.16s)]
*  But then you start talking again about the National Guard and the Marines and then people get angry and upset [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=423.76000000000005s)]
*  But again, usually it is a smaller group of people in comparison to the people that are protesting [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=429.44s)]
*  Peacefully and I want to get their message across willing NBC's Camila Bernal reporting for us from Los Angeles again this morning Camila [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=434.6s)]
*  Thanks so much [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWpUJGO2IM&t=442.48s)]
