# 'The Iranians have no good options': Ret. Gen Barry McCaffrey
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw)
*  With us now NBC News Chief Foreign Affairs correspondent Andrew Mitchell and also retired [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=0.0s)]
*  four-star Army General Barry McCaffrey. He's an NBC News and MSNBC military analyst. General, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=4.88s)]
*  I want to get to this attack, how the military performed during the attack. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=12.48s)]
*  But the first thing I want to ask is, hearing Congressman Massey talk, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=22.16s)]
*  I'm just curious your thoughts on the fact that the UN had actually even come out and said that the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=27.279999999999998s)]
*  Iranians had a significant stockpile of uranium that was enriched to 60 percent and were mere [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=33.44s)]
*  weeks away from being able to break out and start having enough uranium to create weapons. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=41.44s)]
*  And I'm curious, obviously two bad choices here for whomever the president is. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=50.88s)]
*  But I'm just curious, do you think the cost of inaction [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=59.52s)]
*  would have been more dangerous than the cost of action? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=64.48s)]
*  Well, look, this was a no question in my mind, a stunningly decisive, bold move on the part of the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=68.4s)]
*  administration to strike this nuclear production capability. To some extent, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=76.8s)]
*  it turned into a political proxy fight over how soon could they develop a weapon. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=82.48s)]
*  I would assert with 900 plus pounds of 60 percent HEU, they could develop the fissile material for [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=88.24s)]
*  a weapon within a matter of days or weeks, and certainly within a year they could produce a [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=97.52s)]
*  device. The North Koreans have done it. They're a primitive society. The Iranians are sophisticated [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=103.28s)]
*  with a deep scientific bench, so they were en route to a declared nuclear state. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=109.28s)]
*  I think the strike probably set them back severely. That doesn't mean that they've [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=117.04s)]
*  stopped their nuclear program. That will only be achieved by a political resolution, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=121.6s)]
*  diplomatic negotiations, and inspectors on the ground. But it was certainly a good first step. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=127.2s)]
*  Now, the Iranians have no good options. The next 72 hours are going to be very perilous for peace [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=134.16s)]
*  in the region. They could close the Persian Gulf, carry out terrorist attacks, cyber attacks. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=140.96s)]
*  But this is also, Joe, a new form of warfare. There is zero possibility of substantial U.S. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=147.76s)]
*  ground combat forces or Israeli combat forces taking part in this campaign. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=156.8s)]
*  So the question is, can air power and missiles continue to degrade Iran's options? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=163.84s)]
*  I think regime change is a very possible outcome. Since 7 October, those demented attacks on Israel, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=171.76000000000002s)]
*  they've lost all their proxies, largely. Their economy is in a shambles. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=182.08s)]
*  Their leadership has led them down the wrong road. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=188.24s)]
*  Andrea, if you could give us your reporting on our allies in the region, the Saudis, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=192.8s)]
*  the UAE, Jordan, others who publicly are suggesting their concerns, but privately, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=201.76000000000002s)]
*  at least with my reporting, are glad that Iran's capabilities, nuclear capabilities, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=211.04000000000002s)]
*  have been compromised. What are you hearing? Well, you're absolutely correct that privately, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=219.60000000000002s)]
*  they are very pleased that the capability has been degraded. It remains to be seen from the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=224.88s)]
*  intelligence assessment of the bomb damage assessment, which is going to be complicated, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=230.4s)]
*  just how much it has been degraded, whether or not any of the centrifuges were damaged. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=236.56s)]
*  They're nailed down. They're locked in. So probably they are damaged by the bunker buster bombs. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=242.95999999999998s)]
*  But how much of the 900 pounds of 60 percent enriched uranium has been damaged? Was it all [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=248.72s)]
*  moved into tunnels? Is it dispersed? And how hard will it be to locate underground? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=255.6s)]
*  That said, a lot has changed since October 7th because of what has happened in Gaza, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=261.6s)]
*  the way Israel has conducted the war, the retaliation. Yes, obviously eliminating leadership [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=268.48s)]
*  of Hamas and Hezbollah. Assad is gone. So Iran doesn't have those defenses. But Iran has a [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=276.24s)]
*  substantial military, as we all know. And the fact is that Iran still has resources. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=281.76s)]
*  Foreign Minister Arachi was in Moscow today when I interviewed him on Friday in Geneva. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=290.48s)]
*  Right before this happened, he was taking a very hard line, which clearly was part of the hard line [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=296.08s)]
*  that persuaded Steve Witkoff and the president and his advisors, his top advisors, that Iran [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=302.48s)]
*  was stalling, was, as the president put it, tapping them and was not going to deal because [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=308.48s)]
*  they refused the offer from Witkoff and the U.S. to off-site the enrichment, to accept [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=314.96000000000004s)]
*  enriched uranium at 3.75 percent, which is all that is needed for civilian use, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=322.08000000000004s)]
*  and not the extraordinary 60 percent that they've been developing since they first broke out in 2019. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=327.28000000000003s)]
*  So as we remember, Donald Trump got out of the deal, the JCPOA, in 2018. About a year later, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=334.64s)]
*  according to the IAEA and other inspections, certainly U.S. intelligence, they started breaking [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=340.56s)]
*  out. They declared that they were going to start enriching because they were still under sanctions [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=346.32s)]
*  from the U.S., not the Europeans, but the sanctions from the U.S. And Trump had gotten out of it. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=351.12s)]
*  They felt that they were entitled to, and they've been developing and enriching ever since. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=357.28s)]
*  There is no excuse, and Rachi, in our interview, could not explain to me what the excuse was for [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=361.35999999999996s)]
*  enriching to 60 percent, since there's no civilian purpose that is conceivable for that level, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=367.44s)]
*  weapons grade. And they could have clearly gone to a weapon, a delivery system, within a year or so. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=375.67999999999995s)]
*  you [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ivH2vCsw&t=391.28s)]
