# 'Democrats are for border security': Senator releases immigration overhaul proposal
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k)
*  Joining us now, Democratic member of the Homeland Security Committee, Senator Ruben Gallego [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=0.0s)]
*  of Arizona. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=4.62s)]
*  Morning. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=5.62s)]
*  He is an Iraq War veteran. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=6.62s)]
*  Good morning, Senator. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=7.62s)]
*  Let's just, we have a lot of ground to cover with you, but let's just start right there. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=8.620000000000001s)]
*  Your thoughts on the president's Middle Eastern trip, but also the idea that he might accept [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=10.94s)]
*  this plane from one of the countries he's about to visit. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=15.48s)]
*  Well, look, this is just outright corruption. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=18.48s)]
*  The fact that this plane is going to also go right to the Trump library afterwards, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=22.96s)]
*  that's just a basic bribe. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=28.36s)]
*  And I'm glad that he's going to the Middle East. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=31.28s)]
*  We always want our presidents to do well, to be able to go and have good relations with [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=33.02s)]
*  allies and people that want to invest in the United States and people that base tens of [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=37.84s)]
*  thousands of our troops. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=42.260000000000005s)]
*  But at the same time, you shouldn't be selling out this country for your personal or your [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  family benefit. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=48.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=49.0s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=50.0s)]
*  Senator, you're releasing a comprehensive immigration plan aimed at overhauling the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=51.0s)]
*  country's border processes. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=55.64s)]
*  The five point plan embraces some of the president's border security priorities while expanding [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=58.44s)]
*  pathways to citizenship and refugee acceptance. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=63.92s)]
*  Tell us more and how possible are these concepts? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=67.68s)]
*  Well, the most important thing is I wanted the Democrats to have something to center [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=71.76s)]
*  themselves, because we don't want to just be the party that is always saying that Donald [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=75.48s)]
*  Trump is wrong. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=79.84s)]
*  We have to actually have a real conversation what border security looks like from a democratic [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=81.48s)]
*  perspective. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=85.08s)]
*  And one of that is to start is that we do want to secure border and we want to secure [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=86.08s)]
*  border that it's being done by professional civilian authorities, not the military, because [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=89.8s)]
*  that's not sustainable in the long run. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=94.24s)]
*  It's also a realization that we're not going to be able to legally bring in or make the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=96.64s)]
*  people that are here in this country, the eight million people here, full citizens. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=102.48s)]
*  So I actually bring down who actually has a ability for citizenship to dreamers, to [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=105.56s)]
*  that have served this country and the wives and spouses of U.S. citizens, while being [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=111.12s)]
*  realistic that the millions of other people that are in this country illegally do want [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=116.12s)]
*  some legal stability. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=119.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=120.84s)]
*  So we're offering, for example, visa so they could actually be here and work and get out [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=121.84s)]
*  of the shadows. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=126.48s)]
*  But overall, what this is a message is for Democrats to be able to take onto the road, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  talk about where real democratic proposition is when it comes to border security. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=132.16s)]
*  When it first starts with us understanding that the American public wants a secure border [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=137.28s)]
*  where the Democrat, Republican or independent. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=141.8s)]
*  And that's why I was able to win in Arizona in a year where the Democrats not do very [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=143.48s)]
*  well in Arizona. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=146.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=148.44s)]
*  I mean, it's certainly two things can be true at the same time. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=149.44s)]
*  You want a strong border, Molly. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=152.2s)]
*  And at the same time, I think politically there might be some opportunity here for Democrats [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=154.16s)]
*  because I'm not sure it's working for Republicans. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=158.48s)]
*  A lot of the videos that you see on social media of these ice raids, we're working to [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=160.52s)]
*  corroborate a situation out of Worcester, Massachusetts, a couple of Massachusetts cases [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=165.12s)]
*  that just look horrendous. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=170.32s)]
*  And people close to the president have told me that taking babies or ripping babies out [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=172.6s)]
*  of the arms of mothers and these videos are exactly not what they wanted. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=179.68s)]
*  They wanted to be focused on criminals. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  That doesn't appear to be what's happening. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=187.36s)]
*  And I think these videos have a strong impact, Molly, on what the public feels about this [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=189.12s)]
*  president's policies. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=194.96s)]
*  For sure. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=196.64000000000001s)]
*  And actually, Ruben, I was curious. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=197.64000000000001s)]
*  You are one of the few senators who won in a sort of you. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=199.6s)]
*  There are Gallego Trump voters, which a lot of these Democrats won because the Trump voters [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=205.24s)]
*  left the bottom of the ticket blank. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=211.20000000000002s)]
*  But you actually were able to thread the needle. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=213.04000000000002s)]
*  So explain to us how you did it. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=215.56s)]
*  Well, just kind of what just going on, which Mika just said, what I knew in talking to [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=217.92000000000002s)]
*  voters in Arizona, especially Latino voters, is that they wanted border security. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=223.56s)]
*  What they didn't want is exactly what they're seeing right now. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=226.72s)]
*  Families being torn apart, due process just being thrown out the window. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=229.64s)]
*  People that are here legally right now and that are in the process of getting their green [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=234.76s)]
*  cards are getting separated. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=237.96s)]
*  That's not what they want. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=239.8s)]
*  And this is the reason we're releasing this plan is so Democrats can actually point to [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=240.8s)]
*  something and say, this is what a real bill looks like that provides border security, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=244.26s)]
*  a humane process for people to stay in this country while at the same time being realistic [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=249.6s)]
*  also about our broken asylum system so it's not ever abused again. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=253.76s)]
*  Senator, I was looking at your five-point plan. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=258.36s)]
*  It's eminently reasonable. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=262.04s)]
*  You know what has happened historically. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=264.76s)]
*  With eminently reasonable comprehensive immigration reform plans, they die. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=267.76s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=275.32s)]
*  Do you think that finally now we're ready to do some kind of obvious things that need [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=277.36s)]
*  to be done? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=283.68s)]
*  I think one of the problems that we've always had is when dealing with the comprehensive [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=284.68s)]
*  immigration reform plan, it was designed to be all-encompassing, but it wasn't actually [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=287.2s)]
*  designed politically to pass. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=292.52s)]
*  So we've been so focused on this massive bill instead of actually trying to figure out what [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=294.16s)]
*  politically can work first. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=298.36s)]
*  The most important thing though that we need to do is establish that Democrats are for [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=299.64s)]
*  border security. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=302.8s)]
*  Because if you go out and you survey Americans, they don't trust Democrats when it comes to [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=304.24s)]
*  immigration reform or border security because we've always had this feeling that it has [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=308.03999999999996s)]
*  to be either or. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=311.4s)]
*  No. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=312.4s)]
*  Border security itself is a good value that Democrats should be standing up for. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=313.4s)]
*  We should do it in a comprehensive way, something that's respectful of rights, making sure that [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=317.4s)]
*  it's not an overblown government project, but that will actually get us more people [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=322.0s)]
*  willing to listen to us. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=328.2s)]
*  And this is what happened in Arizona. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=329.2s)]
*  We focus a lot on border security, on the need to hire more border patrol agents, and [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=331.24s)]
*  Democrats should own that space, the fact that we do want to secure a border. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=335.72s)]
*  Once we do that, it's going to be easier for us to pass modest piece of legislation. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=339.68s)]
*  And we have to go in a modest manner because we need to get the American public to understand [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=344.08s)]
*  that immigration reform is not going to destroy this country. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=348.28000000000003s)]
*  As a matter of fact, it'll make us stronger, but we should accept the fact that we should [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=351.0s)]
*  do it in a piecemeal fashion so people can actually start feeling the positive effects [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=354.08s)]
*  of it. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=358.2s)]
*  Senator Gallego, Arizona, of course, a battleground state. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=359.44s)]
*  So is Pennsylvania, a state you visited recently, a long way from home, many have noted. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=362.47999999999996s)]
*  What brought you to the Keystone state recently? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=368.68s)]
*  Well, I got the invite, to be honest. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=372.32s)]
*  And look, I have been invited to a lot of swing states and different parts of the country [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=376.08s)]
*  to be keynote speaker, to be a keynote speaker. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=381.44s)]
*  And this one actually happened to work for my schedule. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=384.0s)]
*  Joe was able to go and turn around and come back and spend Mother's Day weekend with my [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=387.03999999999996s)]
*  wife and my kids. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=391.12s)]
*  So that's the honest truth. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=392.56s)]
*  And the secondary, look, I want a message to be out there that the Democratic Party [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=394.35999999999996s)]
*  is the Big Ten Party. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=399.35999999999996s)]
*  We need to be inclusive. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=400.84s)]
*  We need to be pushing new ideas because I think the person who's going to run next time [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=402.76s)]
*  for president, that's not going to be me because I know you're about to jump to that question, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=407.0s)]
*  needs to have that perspective in order for us to win in 2026 and in 2028. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPB4fQ5eq-k&t=410.59999999999997s)]
