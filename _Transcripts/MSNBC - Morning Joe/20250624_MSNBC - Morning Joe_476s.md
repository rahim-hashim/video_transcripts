# Breaking: Israel claims Iran 'completely violated' ceasefire; Iran denies launching new missiles
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY)
*  John, I'm here while we were sleeping news breaking [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, there is a lot to get to this morning and we'll begin with that breaking news a top Israeli official says that Iran has [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=3.96s)]
*  Completely violated the ceasefire just hours after it went into effect [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=11.76s)]
*  Officials claim that Tehran launched war missiles into Israeli territory. No injuries though have been reported [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=16.56s)]
*  Iran is denying that it violated the agreement [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=23.32s)]
*  But now the IDF has been instructed to respond forcefully [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=26.319999999999997s)]
*  With strikes against the Iranian government targets in the heart of Tehran [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=30.64s)]
*  This comes just two hours after Israel officially accepted the ceasefire deal with Iran and [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=35.36s)]
*  President Trump claimed that the agreement was in effect now Trump first announced the deal yesterday evening saying [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=42.12s)]
*  Iran will halt its attacks first then Israel will start the ceasefire [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=49.0s)]
*  Bring it into in his words an official end to the 12-day war Iran said last night [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=53.68s)]
*  It's willing to stop hostilities if Israel does the same [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=58.92s)]
*  But shortly afterwards Israel reported a barrage of missiles that were launched from Tehran [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=62.4s)]
*  At least five people were killed in that strike then overnight [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=68.08s)]
*  Israeli forces announced that they destroyed missile launchers in Western Iran that they say were aimed towards Israeli territory [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=72.56s)]
*  The attacks then stopped until just moments ago when Israel said it detected another [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=81.28s)]
*  Iranian barrage now even earlier in the day before the ceasefire was announced [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=87.24s)]
*  Iran launched missiles at the United States Air Base in [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=92.44s)]
*  Qatar both the US and Qatar were informed about the strike before it happened air defenses shot down 13 of the 14 missiles [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=96.28s)]
*  While the remaining one reportedly posed no threat was let let go no casualties reported [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=104.16s)]
*  Iran's telegraphed assault outside of populated areas [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=111.28s)]
*  Suggested it was prepared to reduce tensions while also trying to save face among its own population [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=116.47999999999999s)]
*  In a very lengthy post on social media President Trump thanked Iran for giving early notice of the strike [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  Which he described as very weak so Joe let's underscore this the United States of course hit these Iranian targets on [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=128.72s)]
*  Saturday [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=136.04s)]
*  Inflicting damage not sure how much right significant damage on its nuclear sites [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=136.88s)]
*  There was a sense that Iran would strike back the question is how much? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=141.24s)]
*  turned out pretty limited pretty face-saving measure yesterday at the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=146.0s)]
*  US base in Qatar [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=150.2s)]
*  Telegraphed in advance the US was able to easily pick it down the question then was Trump gonna respond the answer at least for the moment [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=152.56s)]
*  Is no, but now we will of course wait to see if indeed the ceasefire has already been broken [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=159.52s)]
*  Well, I'm curious your thoughts [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=165.24s)]
*  It would seem to me that certainly the feeling from those I talked to yesterday around the region feeling is Iran [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=167.56s)]
*  And it's it's it's already a cliche [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  24 hours into it, but Iran doesn't have quote any cards to play are many cards to play [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=176.96s)]
*  So a ceasefire makes sense to them you heard Israel talking [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=182.48s)]
*  Sort of edging up to this is ceasefire moment saying that they've achieved most of their strategic goals [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=186.44s)]
*  I'm curious your thoughts so with Donald Trump in the middle of these two with Iran [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=192.92s)]
*  Certainly not wanting to encourage further US attacks, and we saw that yesterday with with how the cutter strikes played out [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=199.44s)]
*  I guess the question is will the president be able to keep Israel [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=207.16s)]
*  Locked in along with Iran locked in to this ceasefire deal [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=213.2s)]
*  Obviously there gonna be elements in Iran that are going to want to push back against us as well [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, well as you and I discussed yesterday as I then later reported in the day for the Atlantic [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=222.28s)]
*  I mean President Trump he kind of wanted this to be a one-off [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=226.35999999999999s)]
*  He did the strikes on Saturday hoping that would be it his hand would be forced if Iran were to retaliate [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=228.95999999999998s)]
*  Forcefully the sense then would be well the US would have to hit back [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=235.35999999999999s)]
*  But Iran's response was so limited and frankly weak that the US was able Trump was able to to use the words of a senior [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=238.44s)]
*  Take the win and move on didn't need to escalate further [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=246.28s)]
*  And then he's really banking and betting big on this ceasefire something he really wants he wants these hostilities to end [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=249.84s)]
*  Feels like the mission was [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=256.6s)]
*  Accomplished although again we there are questions remaining about the fate of the Iranian nuclear program [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=258.68s)]
*  But hoping hostilities would end, but it is a fast-moving fluid situation [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=266.16s)]
*  So let's bring in NBC News chief international correspondent Keir Simmons now live from Iraq here good to see you [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=271.14s)]
*  As we just discussed a lot of unknowns right now [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=278.54s)]
*  What's the very latest there from the region in terms of the state of play? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=282.38s)]
*  Yeah, it is a little murky right now. We do have some reports of strikes on [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=288.9s)]
*  camps sites here in Iraq those reports to that the [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=295.22s)]
*  Iranians have fired on Israel the Iranians [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=300.14s)]
*  saying that that is not the case, but it is a [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=303.5s)]
*  dramatic [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=308.9s)]
*  escalation it just hours after the [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=310.38s)]
*  Israeli government announced that it agreed with the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=314.7s)]
*  president's [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=319.85999999999996s)]
*  Announcement that there would be a ceasefire and it was a fulsome statements just hours ago remember this from the Israeli government [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=321.5s)]
*  Saying that the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would convene the cabinet [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=329.78s)]
*  That Israel has eliminated a dual immediate existential threat both in the nuclear field and in the realm of ballistic [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=334.34s)]
*  Missile so effectively Israel declaring victory and saying okay [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=342.18s)]
*  Good for us. We're done here and [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=346.5s)]
*  then these reports of the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=349.41999999999996s)]
*  Iranian [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=351.97999999999996s)]
*  according to the Israelis [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=353.18s)]
*  Breaking the ceasefire should say that at the very same time the Iranians [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=354.78000000000003s)]
*  Through Iranian state media appear to be saying that they that the Israelis broke the ceasefire [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=359.42s)]
*  One of the clues to this might be if you know what seems like an age ago [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=364.58s)]
*  But was literally some 12 hours ago if you think back to the President Trump's post on truth social [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=369.42s)]
*  The timing was a little confusing about which side was going to stop when and so once you have that [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=376.58s)]
*  You know kind of slightly [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=383.34s)]
*  Unclear picture of how it's supposed to work [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=386.14s)]
*  You then potentially risk both sides accusing the other of breaking it now [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=389.53999999999996s)]
*  I'm told by a [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=396.26s)]
*  diplomat with knowledge of the talks [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=398.38s)]
*  here in the region that [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=400.41999999999996s)]
*  this may be a [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=403.14s)]
*  Shake in the ceasefire rather than an end to the ceasefire that this may be both sides [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=405.34s)]
*  Are gonna hit each other once and then they're done [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=411.5s)]
*  But I think another aspect of all of this though is the strike that Iran carried out on their Shiba overnight [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=415.14s)]
*  Which was it which appears to have been just before the ceasefire? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=421.26s)]
*  That was that was inflicted real [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=427.06s)]
*  Deadly impact in Israel last I checked there was a report of five dead [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=431.02s)]
*  So that I think has left [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=437.22s)]
*  The Israelis pretty pretty furious just at the moment when they are agreeing to [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=440.66s)]
*  cessation [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=448.3s)]
*  You [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IvIflLjrKY&t=469.66s)]
