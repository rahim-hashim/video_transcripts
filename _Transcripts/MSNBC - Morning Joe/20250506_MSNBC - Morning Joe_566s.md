# 'Chaos and confusion': Michigan official rebukes Trump's tariffs for causing residents economic pain
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc)
*  Well, I want to talk about lifesaving abortion health care overall and the fight for women [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=0.0s)]
*  who have been set back decades and decades with our next guest. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=6.72s)]
*  Joining us now, Michigan's Democratic Secretary of State, Jocelyn Benson. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=11.44s)]
*  She's a candidate for governor and author of the new memoir, The Purposeful Warrior, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  Standing Up for What's Right, When the Stakes Are High. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=20.88s)]
*  And of course, Ms. Benson certified a fair and accurate presidential election in her [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=24.04s)]
*  state and then was targeted. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=30.04s)]
*  Her life was threatened. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=31.799999999999997s)]
*  And I wonder first if you can share the basis of the book, what inspired it, and then we'll [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=33.16s)]
*  move into specifics. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=40.92s)]
*  Yeah, well, thank you guys for having me. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=41.92s)]
*  The book actually was something I started to write in the aftermath of that fateful [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=44.68s)]
*  2020 presidential election about what it was like to stand up to the president of the United [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=48.44s)]
*  States and his most ardent followers as they entered into this unprecedented effort to [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=53.4s)]
*  overturn the election leading up to the tragedy of January 6, 2021 that unfolded and really [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=59.0s)]
*  what it took and how stories throughout my life helped me build a bravery muscle for [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=65.08s)]
*  that moment, but really also how important it is for all of us to be able to stand up [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=69.72s)]
*  and speak to power when things like our rights and freedoms are on the line. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=74.68s)]
*  Oh, Secretary Benson, tell me about Michigan right now. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=79.55999999999999s)]
*  You know, in the beginning of the Trump administration, this is a state, you know, that [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=84.91999999999999s)]
*  has gone both ways the last couple of elections, but always closely. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=89.56s)]
*  What are voters thinking about as they watch the beginning of this administration unfold? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=96.52s)]
*  Oh, the last 100 days has been nothing but chaos and confusion for all of our residents, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=103.16s)]
*  whether they voted for the president or not, because the reckless tariffs and the other [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=108.36s)]
*  economic policies we've seen come out of Washington have only increased the cost of living in our [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=113.16s)]
*  state when a lot of these voters who supported the president were expecting him to drive down [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=117.72s)]
*  the cost of living. But whether it's affordable housing or being able to simply just buy eggs [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=122.03999999999999s)]
*  and pay for child care and not have to choose between the two, all of that is front of mind [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=127.16s)]
*  for people right now. And it's really concerning because I think a lot of folks expected [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=131.48s)]
*  light at the end of the tunnel with this administration, and they're only seeing [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=138.44000000000003s)]
*  things get worse. And it's a really long tunnel. But talk about the tariffs specifically. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=141.88000000000002s)]
*  Michigan, there in Detroit, it's the only place in the states that I know of where [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=150.04000000000002s)]
*  you actually go south to go to Canada. I mean, and the way that Detroit and Windsor, Ontario have been [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=155.56s)]
*  integrated all this time, the way the auto industry, vehicles cross borders, parts of vehicles [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=163.56s)]
*  cross border. How is that impacting people in your state? Yeah, we are a border state. We border [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=171.48000000000002s)]
*  Canada. And so our relationship with Canada and that border is very critical to our own specific [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=178.04000000000002s)]
*  economic power and influence and prosperity. And so all of this has created a lot of damage to our [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=183.08s)]
*  state's economy in particular. And also the fact that we build things in Michigan is a great thing. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=189.72s)]
*  We want to build more things in Michigan. That's one of the things that has helped our economy [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=194.76s)]
*  thrive. But at the same time, these reckless tariffs have not been specific enough to help [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=198.84s)]
*  us build more things. They've only caused a lot of economic pain and duress. Secretary Benson, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=203.32s)]
*  good morning. Thanks for coming on the show again. People see you on Morning Joe and they ask me what [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=207.72s)]
*  she like. And I say, well, she ran the Boston Marathon while eight months pregnant. And they go, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=211.24s)]
*  oh, got it. Okay. I think I understand who she is. But let's talk about the book specifically, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=215.72s)]
*  The Purposeful Warrior. You've talked about how you sort of stood in the breach there in 2020 and [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=221.0s)]
*  certified that election. You had people coming to your house threatening you armed protesters. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=226.04s)]
*  Can you just talk a little bit about what it means to you to be a purposeful warrior? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, in the same sense that what enabled me to run that marathon eight months pregnant, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=237.0s)]
*  which I have a chapter in the book that's all about that, it's really about how all of us can [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=241.07999999999998s)]
*  accomplish so much more than we realize. And oftentimes folks will use fear, particularly [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=245.48s)]
*  powerful folks will use fear to try to make us feel like our voice doesn't matter or we have to [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=249.95999999999998s)]
*  sit down and not stand up for what's right. But that's when it's even more important to raise [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=255.07999999999998s)]
*  our voice and speak that truth to power. And so my book was how I've collected experiences [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=259.15999999999997s)]
*  throughout my life, including running that marathon that helped me in that critical moment, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=263.96s)]
*  defend our democracy. But it's really a call to action for us all to think about amidst all the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=267.8s)]
*  chaos and confusion of this moment. What can we do to improve our lives, stand up for ourselves, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=272.28s)]
*  the people we love and the communities we call home. This book is a how to guide on how to do [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=277.96s)]
*  that based on stories of my own life and those who've inspired me along the way. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=282.44s)]
*  So secretary Benson, off of that last answer, why are you running for the United States Senate? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=286.67999999999995s)]
*  Why are you running specifically? Do you think it would make such a difference in people's lives [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=294.52s)]
*  that you were running rather than someone else? Yeah, I'm running to be the next governor of [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=299.16s)]
*  Michigan because I'm a mom of an eight year old son who in 10 years is going to be 18 and deciding [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=303.08000000000004s)]
*  what he does with his life. The next 10 years is going to define his childhood, his future [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=308.36s)]
*  and the childhood and future of all of our loved ones in so many ways. And so for me, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=313.08000000000004s)]
*  it's personal in making sure that Michigan's economy is one where everyone can prosper and [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=316.92s)]
*  thrive and where you don't have to choose between access to childcare and access to food. I believe [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=321.48s)]
*  the next governor of Michigan will need to be a warrior, someone who's willing to stand up to this [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=327.24s)]
*  administration and also do everything we can to work with anyone on either side of the aisle to [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=331.08s)]
*  improve the economic well-being of all of our residents. Well, secretary Benson, I was going [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=335.88s)]
*  to ask you about that because you talk about being a purposeful warrior. You talk about the courage [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=340.12s)]
*  that had to be shown in 2020 and I just can't help but go back and think about the Republicans [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=345.56s)]
*  also that stood by your side, those local officials in Wayne County, those local Republican [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=351.72s)]
*  officials across the state of Michigan that were threatened, those judges that have stood up, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=357.32000000000005s)]
*  that may have been members of the Federalist Society across America, the Trump appointed judges [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=363.64000000000004s)]
*  right now that grew up as Republicans appointed by Donald Trump that are standing up for immigrants, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=368.76000000000005s)]
*  that are standing up for the very things that you were fighting. Talk about, as Gene said, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=374.84000000000003s)]
*  in a swing state like Michigan, how important it is to do two things at once. Be a warrior for [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=381.16s)]
*  the things that you believe in and also reach across the aisle and figure out how to work [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=386.84000000000003s)]
*  for the people of Michigan. Yeah, I think it's possible and necessary to be able to do both, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=391.64000000000004s)]
*  to both stand up for our rights and freedoms and against anyone who would try to harm the economic [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=398.20000000000005s)]
*  power of our citizens and still be able to work with anyone and get stuff done and that's exactly [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=403.48s)]
*  what I've done as Secretary of State. I've turned around our DMV, our Department of Motor Vehicles. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=407.8s)]
*  It used to be a poster child for inefficiency. Now it's the most efficient government agency in [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=412.2s)]
*  our state. No wait times and all the rest because I was able to work across the aisle and make data [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=417.0s)]
*  driven solution oriented decisions to get things done and that's really the job of a governor, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=421.48s)]
*  to stand up for what we believe in, to really adhere to our values of inclusion and ensuring [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=426.6s)]
*  everyone has a fair shot and being able to work with anyone to make data driven decisions that [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=432.44s)]
*  are solution oriented and move the ball forward and improve everyone's lives. Secretary Benson, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=437.4s)]
*  I'd love to ask you about an area where women obviously are really struggling across the country [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=442.44s)]
*  and that pertains to abortion health care and all the other related issues. What are some of the [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=447.15999999999997s)]
*  messages and the advice in your book and your experience as a women leader that they can draw [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=453.64s)]
*  from, whether it's advocates or just moms turned advocates after their terrible experiences, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=459.56s)]
*  to fight for the rights we once had? Yeah, you know one of the stories I share for the first time [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=466.6s)]
*  in this book was what it was like to go through a miscarriage and how challenging it was and how [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=472.68s)]
*  important it was to have a strong network of support and health care providers that helped me [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=477.64000000000004s)]
*  make informed decisions about my own reproductive rights and freedom and what I the reason I share [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=482.04s)]
*  that story is in this book is to tell everyone who suffered or perhaps have stories to tell as well [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=487.24s)]
*  how important it is for us as women in particular to share those stories because what happened in [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=493.64s)]
*  Michigan in 2022 is that women came together and amended our state constitution, worked across the [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=498.84s)]
*  aisle and voters all across our state to enshrine reproductive freedom and rights in our state [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=503.96s)]
*  constitution but it's not enough because the work still needs to be invested in to ensure those [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=508.28s)]
*  rights are real for everyone and that every one of our families have access to those reproductive [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=513.48s)]
*  health care and freedoms and so there's still work left to be done in Michigan but it's important and [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=518.12s)]
*  it starts with us working together sharing our stories talking about our experiences so that we [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=522.36s)]
*  can see each other and work together. The new book is The Purposeful Warrior, standing up for what's [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=526.6800000000001s)]
*  right when the stakes are high. Michigan's Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson thank you so much for [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=532.36s)]
*  coming on the show this morning congratulations on the book we'll see you soon. Thanks for coming on. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=538.52s)]
*  you [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RdVbXY3iZc&t=552.36s)]
