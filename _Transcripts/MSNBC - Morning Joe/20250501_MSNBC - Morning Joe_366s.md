**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A)
*  Right now, and I told you before, they're having tremendous difficulty because their [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=0.0s)]
*  factories are not doing business. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=5.16s)]
*  They made a trillion dollars with Biden, a trillion dollars, even a trillion won with [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  Biden selling this stuff, much of it we don't need. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  You know, somebody said, oh, the shelves are going to be open. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=18.68s)]
*  Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, you know? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=21.64s)]
*  And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=25.919999999999998s)]
*  Oh, OK. President Trump yesterday acknowledging that there actually may be [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=29.84s)]
*  shortages on some goods because of this terrorist on China, Joe. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=35.4s)]
*  It's like, yeah, just get one doll. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=41.08s)]
*  Well, I mean, you know, our our dear friends at the New York Post and I know [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=46.8s)]
*  that a lot of us calling them their dear friends. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=52.64s)]
*  It is, after all, the paper record for morning Joe skimp on the Barbie [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=54.88s)]
*  Willie Geist. Come on. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=60.88s)]
*  They've done it again. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=62.44s)]
*  The headline writers at the Post have done it again. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=64.08s)]
*  We've talked about this for a long time, Joe. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=67.44s)]
*  I want to go into one of those meetings, the headline meeting. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=69.36s)]
*  Yes. Right. Donald Trump or anybody says something. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=71.76s)]
*  They race in there. They get a zoom going. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=75.04s)]
*  Maybe a white board meeting, a white board. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=77.56s)]
*  Yeah. And they just best idea wins. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=79.48s)]
*  And today, best idea skimp on the Barbie. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=82.28s)]
*  Well, basically Donald Trump saying you spoiled little brats are only getting two [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=84.52s)]
*  dolls this year. Yeah. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=89.6s)]
*  And it's going to cost more. Deal with it rather than 10. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=91.04s)]
*  I think it's more about more than dolls with us. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=94.2s)]
*  We have the co-host of our fourth hour contributing writer at the Atlantic, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=96.84s)]
*  Jonathan O'Meara, U.S. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=100.76s)]
*  special correspondent for BBC News and the host of The Rest is Politics podcast. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=102.52000000000001s)]
*  Cady Kay is with us, former Treasury official and Morning Joe economic analyst. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=107.88s)]
*  Steve Ratner is here and co-founder of Axios Mike Allen. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=112.75999999999999s)]
*  So, Joe, we're still sort of [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=118.03999999999999s)]
*  pouring through all the economic news that came came through yesterday and how [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=121.83999999999999s)]
*  the president is spinning it. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=126.91999999999999s)]
*  Well, and that's why we have Steve Ratner. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=129.51999999999998s)]
*  He studied economics in college, so we don't have to. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=132.0s)]
*  And he's going to tell us all about that in one second. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=135.72s)]
*  I do, Willie, they want to go back to [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=138.51999999999998s)]
*  go back to it. I saw Ali talking about it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=141.95999999999998s)]
*  They had their cabinet meeting, which we can get into later if we choose to or not. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=146.35999999999999s)]
*  But I thought an extraordinary moment happened there. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=151.44s)]
*  And that was when the president was in effect saying goodbye to Elon Musk. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=155.32s)]
*  And it is it has been remarkable. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=160.39999999999998s)]
*  It has been a dizzying rise and fall for Elon Musk's star [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=165.12s)]
*  in Washington, D.C. over the past, what, three months? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=170.52s)]
*  I mean, think about it. Three months ago, he was considered the most powerful person [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=174.96s)]
*  and he was written this way, most powerful non-elected official [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  in the history of the U.S. government, richest man in the world. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=181.88s)]
*  Tesla top, I mean, just top prices in the world. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=185.84s)]
*  Now, yesterday, he's leaving town [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=189.68s)]
*  and and he's lost reports are at least one hundred and twenty five billion dollars [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=193.72s)]
*  of his fortune personally, still extraordinarily rich. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=199.64000000000001s)]
*  The New York Times also has reported this past week, based on studies [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=204.56s)]
*  that doges mistakes, errors and actions will end up costing taxpayers [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=209.56s)]
*  about one hundred and twenty billion or so dollars. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=215.20000000000002s)]
*  And you you compare that to the so-called savings. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=218.72s)]
*  It's a wash. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=222.92s)]
*  You look at how he became such a political liability. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=225.51999999999998s)]
*  This guy, most powerful person in the world, supposedly came such a huge [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=228.35999999999999s)]
*  liability that the Wisconsin race, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=234.4s)]
*  where he was just crushed in the Wisconsin race. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=239.24s)]
*  Seventy one percent decline in Tesla's earnings over the quarter. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=243.4s)]
*  And we just saw the headline Wall Street Journal saying [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=248.12s)]
*  that Tesla's denying it, but the Wall Street Journal is not going to be running this [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=251.68s)]
*  as their as their lead story this morning. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=255.92s)]
*  If it's not true that the Tesla board has began a search [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=259.36s)]
*  for a CEO to replace Elon Musk. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=264.84s)]
*  All this, Willie, all this in three months, it's almost as if. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=268.76s)]
*  Washington always wins. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=274.56s)]
*  And the lasting image of Elon Musk's time in Washington, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=276.6s)]
*  if it is in fact coming to an end, and even the White House has said [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=280.12s)]
*  that Elon Musk is, quote, working remotely from now on, that he has left [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=283.4s)]
*  the White House effectively, the lasting image will be the one we just showed, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=287.4s)]
*  which is Elon Musk, the world's richest man and a pair of sunglasses [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=291.12s)]
*  holding a chainsaw, bragging about going in and making dramatic [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  cuts to the U.S. government, not just waste, fraud and abuse, but USAID, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=300.28000000000003s)]
*  rural hospitals, health care for people, all the things [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=305.6s)]
*  that may come back to haunt if Democrats already have begun to use that imagery. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=309.36s)]
*  And I think we'll continue to see it in midterm elections of the co-president, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=313.59999999999997s)]
*  as some people have called them, came in for three months, wreaked havoc [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=318.15999999999997s)]
*  on the government, tanked his own company, Tesla. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=321.76s)]
*  We have that, as you mentioned, Wall Street Journal report that the Tesla board [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=325.2s)]
*  was casting about suggesting there needs to be a new CEO because he is so [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=328.36s)]
*  distracted and that he needs to come home and run the company. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=333.24s)]
*  So obviously doing damage to the country, doing damage to people's [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=336.28s)]
*  livelihoods, but also to the very company that made him rich and famous. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtiZk1HR6A&t=341.24s)]
