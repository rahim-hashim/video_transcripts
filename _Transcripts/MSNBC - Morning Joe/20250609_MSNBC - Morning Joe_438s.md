# 500 Marines on standby to deploy to Los Angeles amid protests
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU)
*  Our coverage continues now at 26 past the hour. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump is defending his response to the Los Angeles protests, calling the demonstrators [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=4.0s)]
*  quote insurrectionists. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=9.8s)]
*  He made those comments on Truth Social last night saying Governor Newsom and Los Angeles [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=12.540000000000001s)]
*  Mayor Karen Bass should apologize for the quote horrible job they have done. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=18.12s)]
*  But earlier when speaking to reporters, Trump stopped short of saying the protests constituted [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=24.6s)]
*  an insurrection. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=31.12s)]
*  Are you prepared to invoke the insurrection act? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=32.120000000000005s)]
*  Depends on whether or not there's an insurrection. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  No, no, you have violent people and we're not going to let them get away with it. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  And when they spit at people, you know they spit, that's a new thing, they spit and worse. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  You know what they throw at them, right? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=54.64s)]
*  And when that happens, I have a little statement, they say they spit, we hit. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=55.64s)]
*  And I told them, nobody's going to spit on our police officers, nobody's going to spit [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=60.64s)]
*  on our military, which they do is a common thing. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=67.64s)]
*  They get up to them this far away and then they start spitting in their face. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=70.64s)]
*  That happens, they get hit very hard. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=75.64s)]
*  Joining us now, NBC News Senior National Security Correspondent Courtney Kuby. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=80.16s)]
*  Courtney, let's talk about the military angle here with Marines on standby. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=84.16s)]
*  What's the potential here for that to happen and what would that mean? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=90.16s)]
*  So at this point, Mika, as far as we know, there's only about 300 of the National Guard, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=97.16s)]
*  California National Guard troops who are actually on scene. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=102.36s)]
*  There are at least three different locations. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=105.36s)]
*  But remember, this authorization is to federalize up to 2,000. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=107.67999999999999s)]
*  So it would make more sense if they would work through or they would use all 2,000 of [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=110.67999999999999s)]
*  those before they would turn to those Marines. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  But what people need to remember is here is yes, these are California National Guard troops [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  who are being used here. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  But we heard Jacob earlier talk about them being under Title X authority. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=124.67999999999999s)]
*  What that means is they are essentially federalized. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=129.68s)]
*  They are under the authority of the federal government, they're paid by them, they get [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=131.68s)]
*  benefits under the federal government while they're serving, and they are also under the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=136.20000000000002s)]
*  same restrictions that federal troops face when they are operating in the United States. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=140.20000000000002s)]
*  Why that's so critical in this case here is because if you have a National Guard soldier [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  who is under California law or who's under California state activation, that means that [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=150.20000000000002s)]
*  they are they are answering to and under the authority of the governor, Governor Newsom, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  who we've heard from earlier in the show already. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=160.20000000000002s)]
*  In that capacity, they have some ability to conduct law enforcement missions to support [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=162.72s)]
*  the local law enforcement. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=169.72s)]
*  But they have a little bit more authority with actually taking on or conducting law [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=170.72s)]
*  enforcement missions. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=176.72s)]
*  Once those troops are federalized, that goes away. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=177.72s)]
*  They can still support the LAPD and they can support the ICE agents who are there, but [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=180.72s)]
*  they cannot make arrests or conduct what we think of as very basic law enforcement [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=187.24s)]
*  activities. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=192.24s)]
*  That's a violation of Posse Comitatus, which is an act that essentially says you can't [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=193.24s)]
*  have federal or federal troops conducting law enforcement in the continental United [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=197.24s)]
*  States. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=202.24s)]
*  Now, why we what we usually see Title X troops, National Guard troops on federal duty doing [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=203.24s)]
*  is deploying overseas. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=210.24s)]
*  That would even be the case for this unit, the 79th Infantry Brigade Combat Team out [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=211.76000000000002s)]
*  of California. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=216.76000000000002s)]
*  They have done these deployments overseas. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=217.76000000000002s)]
*  So the Title X status is not uncommon, but putting them on Title X and then putting them [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=219.76000000000002s)]
*  in the United States, that's what's so uncommon here. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=224.76000000000002s)]
*  And what's the most unique part about this is the president doing it despite the governor [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=227.76000000000002s)]
*  saying not the governor not asking for these troops, but specifically saying that he doesn't [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=233.76000000000002s)]
*  want the troops to be there. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=237.76000000000002s)]
*  Now, the Marines here, 500 are now under or on a hot standby. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=240.28s)]
*  They have to be ready to go very quickly. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=245.28s)]
*  What's really critical about them is they will also be federalized. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=247.28s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=250.28s)]
*  They are active duty. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=251.28s)]
*  The question everyone should be asking here though, Mika, is are they actually trained [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=252.28s)]
*  for any of the kinds of law enforcement of the sorts of functions that they could be [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=256.28s)]
*  called upon to do here? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=260.28s)]
*  That's one of the questions we've been asking. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=261.28s)]
*  So Courtney, there's been a lot of escalatory rhetoric from Trump's top advisor, Steven [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=263.28s)]
*  Miller, posting simply one word, insurrection, J.D. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=267.79999999999995s)]
*  Vance, similar. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=270.79999999999995s)]
*  Trump himself suggesting that all of the federal law enforcement agencies should be involved. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=272.29999999999995s)]
*  And of course, Secretary of Defense Hegseth. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=276.79999999999995s)]
*  So if they were, if the federal government decides to up the ante here with their response [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=279.79999999999995s)]
*  beyond what we've seen so far, what are some of the things they could do here? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=283.91999999999996s)]
*  Because you're right, and all of it's being done against the wishes of local and state [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=288.28s)]
*  leaders. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=293.0s)]
*  So they can do very basic things in support of LAPD and ICE. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=296.0s)]
*  So traffic enforcement, you know, they can put them outside of federal buildings. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=300.2s)]
*  That's one thing that we've already seen where they're basically a show of presence. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=304.44s)]
*  Now, we have seen from the video and the photos there that they are armed. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=307.84s)]
*  We have asked about the basic rules of force here. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=311.72s)]
*  When you're talking about an overseas mission or a combat, you hear rules of engagement. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=314.8s)]
*  When you're talking in the homeland, they refer to it as rules of force. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=318.12s)]
*  We don't have an answer beyond there. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=321.82s)]
*  They are still under the authorities of the basic rules of force here. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=323.52s)]
*  So presumably that means that they will follow the law and they will, you know, they'll protect [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=327.32s)]
*  federal buildings. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=334.12s)]
*  They will protect ICE agents. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=335.12s)]
*  They will protect any kind of federal personnel who are there, but they will not engage in [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=336.24s)]
*  things like arrests. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=340.5s)]
*  You know, like I said, they could be at barricades hanging out there. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=342.24s)]
*  One thing that I have been very struck by in this, Jonathan, and we got a statement [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=345.62s)]
*  from U.S. Northern Command late last night that said that they had established a task [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=348.58s)]
*  force. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=352.44s)]
*  Force 51. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=354.36s)]
*  It's under a two-star general. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=355.36s)]
*  Generally when you have something, a brigade combat team is about 3,500 up to 5,000 different [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=357.36s)]
*  troops. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=364.08s)]
*  This is smaller than that. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=365.08s)]
*  It's about half that size. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=366.08s)]
*  2,000 troops. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=367.08s)]
*  That would generally be under the authority of a colonel. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=368.08s)]
*  Okay? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=370.04s)]
*  Instead, they are putting this task force under a two-star general. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=371.04s)]
*  That shows, to me, that shows the significance that they are placing on this, on this mission [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=373.84s)]
*  general that they are putting someone so high-ranking involved in it. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=379.78000000000003s)]
*  Military officials, defense officials who I spoke with, are very concerned about the [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=384.06s)]
*  possibility of the military being used here in ways that they should not be. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=386.78000000000003s)]
*  And actually, you know, the perception that they are actually fighting against or taking [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=391.1s)]
*  on civilians in the streets of L.A. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=396.66s)]
*  And that may be one reason they have someone so senior overseeing this entire task force. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=399.9s)]
*  And that certainly would change the nature of this situation and at this point of the [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=405.18s)]
*  presidency. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=409.90000000000003s)]
*  NBC News senior national security correspondent Courtney Kuby, thank you very much for your [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=410.90000000000003s)]
*  coverage. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV0WgV8z1zU&t=417.38s)]
