# 'This is Biden's stock market': Trump blames market losses on predecessor
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHIOXs3CWY)
*  Welcome back. 9 22 here on the East Coast. That's in the central time zone. Foggy start [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHIOXs3CWY&t=0.0s)]
*  the day in Dallas. We were just having a discussion here about latest economic numbers. President [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHIOXs3CWY&t=7.82s)]
*  Trump has weighed in just taking it to social a few seconds ago, shifting blame, saying [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHIOXs3CWY&t=14.9s)]
*  this is Biden's stock market, not Trump's. I didn't take over until January 20th. Terrace [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHIOXs3CWY&t=20.46s)]
*  will soon start kicking in and companies are starting to move into the USA and record numbers. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHIOXs3CWY&t=25.42s)]
*  We should note we have not seen evidence of that just yet. Our country will boom, but [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHIOXs3CWY&t=29.48s)]
*  we have to get rid of the Biden overhang. Right? He might have meant hangover. This [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHIOXs3CWY&t=33.56s)]
*  will take it a while, has nothing to do with tariffs, only that he left us with bad numbers, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHIOXs3CWY&t=38.6s)]
*  etc, etc. So Sam Stein, let's continue our conversation from a moment ago. This is proof [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHIOXs3CWY&t=43.4s)]
*  positive. There are concerned in the White House and certainly in the Oval Office as [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHIOXs3CWY&t=48.72s)]
*  these economic numbers. And we're seeing President Trump, who spent a lot of time in his rally [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHIOXs3CWY&t=54.0s)]
*  yesterday talking about Joe Biden trying to blame his predecessor here. But every economist [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHIOXs3CWY&t=58.48s)]
*  is saying what we're seeing right now is a direct result of the tariffs that have nothing [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHIOXs3CWY&t=64.88s)]
*  to do with the Biden administration. Apologies if I'm a bit groggy this morning. I'm dealing [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHIOXs3CWY&t=69.39999999999999s)]
*  with an overhang from all the drinking last night. I hate it when that happens. I know [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHIOXs3CWY&t=73.72s)]
*  it's tough. A lot of Yeager. John, are you surprised that Trump put up this post? It's [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHIOXs3CWY&t=79.6s)]
*  very unlike him. Not in the slightest. I will just say it's remarkable how when the market [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHIOXs3CWY&t=87.48s)]
*  is doing well, even in prior to the election, it's because of the anticipation of Trump's [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHIOXs3CWY&t=94.04s)]
*  greatness. And when it's doing poorly, it has nothing to do with Donald Trump. Remember [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHIOXs3CWY&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  that it was, I think, about two weeks ago where he briefly pulled back the tariffs, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHIOXs3CWY&t=104.64s)]
*  the stock market boomed up and all the White House apparatchiks and fanboys were saying, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHIOXs3CWY&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  art of the deal, look at how great he is at managing the stock market. So of course now [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHIOXs3CWY&t=114.72s)]
*  it's all Biden's fault. In reality, this is Trump's fault. It's Trump's fault. The stock [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHIOXs3CWY&t=118.96s)]
*  market is tanking because of the tariffs and the uncertainty around them. The numbers, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHIOXs3CWY&t=123.6s)]
*  as we talked about today, they're not like horrific, but they're not good. And everyone [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHIOXs3CWY&t=127.4s)]
*  is anticipating a Q2 and a next jobs report that's going to be really bad. And so recession [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHIOXs3CWY&t=131.8s)]
*  fears are pretty rampant and economic confidence is pretty low. And that is a formula for a [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHIOXs3CWY&t=137.24s)]
*  bad stock market. And Trump could cast blame on Biden. He can cast blame on Jerome Powell. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHIOXs3CWY&t=142.28s)]
*  But in the end, he's the president. Buck stops with him and he can't take credit for when [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHIOXs3CWY&t=148.12s)]
*  times are good and not get blamed for when times are bad. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHIOXs3CWY&t=151.72s)]
*  Well, I don't know anyone who wanted the tariffs. I mean, except for the people who work for [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHIOXs3CWY&t=154.6s)]
*  him who kind of go along with it, but nobody likes them. They're his. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHIOXs3CWY&t=159.16s)]
*  And Scott Besson has been out saying, you know, as soon as the market goes up for a [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHIOXs3CWY&t=163.0s)]
*  day, Besson is out on the airwaves saying, look, the market's back. I mean, it's such [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHIOXs3CWY&t=166.96s)]
*  a dangerous game. The markets are going to go up and down. The economics are not great. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHIOXs3CWY&t=170.26000000000002s)]
*  There's no way to spin this. All right. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVHIOXs3CWY&t=174.78s)]
