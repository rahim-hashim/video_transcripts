# 'It makes no sense': Medicaid cuts will have deep impact, says governor
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8)
*  These are live pictures from Capitol Hill where the House Energy and Commerce Committee's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=0.0s)]
*  marathon session continues on the potential Medicaid cuts in the GOP's domestic policy [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=5.12s)]
*  bill. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  Our next guest says those potential cuts to Medicaid would destroy health care as we know [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  Democratic governor of New Mexico, Michelle Lujan Grisham joins us now. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  We do want to talk about the business incubator that you and state officials in New Mexico [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=23.66s)]
*  are setting up to boost foreign investment, but first let's go there on Medicaid. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=29.319999999999997s)]
*  As it stands now, if you could expound upon your comments, how would these cuts impact [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=34.66s)]
*  your state's residents? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=41.58s)]
*  Well, let's be clear that Medicaid and then the federal program for older people, Medicare [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=43.76s)]
*  and Veterans Care and Tricare, all these systems, all together invest in creating hospitals, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=50.12s)]
*  doctors, providers, and then Medicaid in particular covers though to our sickest, oldest, children, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=57.599999999999994s)]
*  and poorest. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=66.16s)]
*  So when you rip that money away, 840,000 people in New Mexico are on Medicaid. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=67.24s)]
*  Eight of our hospitals are at risk of closure in the current situation. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=73.28s)]
*  You take Medicaid out, they're done. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=78.4s)]
*  That means that you're traveling further, there are fewer doctors, that means you're [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=80.56s)]
*  delaying care. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=85.0s)]
*  It means that you're making co-pays, which means people have to choose between utility [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=86.47999999999999s)]
*  bills and food and mortgage payments so they don't go. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=90.55999999999999s)]
*  It really unravels that cornerstone of protection for the people who need it most. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=94.63999999999999s)]
*  And I want to just repeat that. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=100.78s)]
*  Children, seniors living in nursing homes, disabled veterans, disabled adults, and the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=102.88s)]
*  working poor. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=109.88s)]
*  It makes no sense. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=111.56s)]
*  We ought to be looking at how we make our healthcare system more affordable all the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  way around, have higher quality, and look at ways to navigate it so that it's not so [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=117.8s)]
*  bureaucratic. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=123.24000000000001s)]
*  Governor, you are governor of New Mexico, and you're also a Democrat. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  The fact that the debate has been around the Democratic Party, who's woke, who's not, who's [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=129.84s)]
*  young, who's old, how do we get the message out to voters? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=135.64000000000001s)]
*  What you're talking about, about there's some real everyday problems for voters that [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=141.0s)]
*  you just laid out, that if Medicaid is cut, less known, less than Medicare and others, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=147.64s)]
*  we're talking about real people and real suffering who could care less who's young or old or [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=154.64s)]
*  who's woke or asleep, but that this is real life-changing stuff for people that will suffer. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=159.0s)]
*  Well, I'm doing it right now, and I'm going to urge you and every other person in a position [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=167.0s)]
*  to talk about these issues, to invite more guests, call your member of Congress. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=172.95999999999998s)]
*  These are not new debates about Medicaid, and every time this happens, people lose coverage, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=178.16s)]
*  healthcare costs go up, people with private insurance get less, pay more. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=184.0s)]
*  This is really about protecting your family, right? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=189.07999999999998s)]
*  People want dignity at work, they want meaningful wages, and they want access where healthcare [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=193.28s)]
*  companies can't just indiscriminately choose to throw you off or not or to cover a particular [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=200.0s)]
*  aspect of your care. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=206.08s)]
*  These are fundamental aspects of quality of life for American families and for New Mexico [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=208.16s)]
*  families, and I think we all should gear up to really lay the case and to make sure that [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=215.16000000000003s)]
*  members of Congress who I think are feeling heat about this. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=221.96s)]
*  Well, you talk to moms about whether or not you can get care for your child who's suffering [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=224.84s)]
*  with a chronic disease or cancer. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=230.76000000000002s)]
*  Boy, you're talking about a force of nature, and I know this. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=233.16s)]
*  I watched my parents fight for care and coverage for my sister who blew through her insurance [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=237.76000000000002s)]
*  caps because she had a brain tumor by the time she was three in the 60s and early 70s. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=244.38s)]
*  This is life or death, an incredible hardship, and also costs families, which means we aren't [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=251.94s)]
*  building an economy that works for every American, every New Mexican. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=258.9s)]
*  And again, it impacts everybody, whether you're in urban centers, rural, whether blue state [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=262.54s)]
*  America, red state America, Medicaid has a massive impact on the healthcare systems all [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=270.46s)]
*  across the country. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=276.86s)]
*  Governor, could you tell us about this economic incubator that you're creating in your state? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=279.09999999999997s)]
*  Obviously, the global competition is getting more and more fierce, not just between countries, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=285.85999999999996s)]
*  but also between states in the U.S. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=293.62s)]
*  Talk about what you're doing in Albuquerque that might be actually a good roadmap for [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=296.24s)]
*  governors in other states. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=301.5s)]
*  Well, thank you. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=303.21999999999997s)]
*  We announced yesterday at SelectUSA, which is an effort by the Department of Commerce, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=304.26s)]
*  happens every year to bring international partners and companies and talk to them about [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=310.86s)]
*  investing in America. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=316.65999999999997s)]
*  And based on a trip I took to India last year, we have both African and India private sector [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=318.74s)]
*  companies that are going to come together in kind of a hub or an incubator. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=326.48s)]
*  They're going to bring four or five employees each at seven different companies ranging [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=331.72s)]
*  from high tech to ag and water innovation. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=337.06s)]
*  And we're going to remove all of those difficult barriers, right? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=341.52000000000004s)]
*  So instead of just a navigation tool, it's a launch pad to their success. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=346.0s)]
*  So we deal with HR issues and tax issues and incorporation issues and HR issues. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=352.88000000000005s)]
*  We also lend a hand to make sure that the benefits and opportunities and investments [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=358.84s)]
*  the state makes for private sector investments occur. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=363.79999999999995s)]
*  So it's inviting foreign direct investment. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=367.67999999999995s)]
*  It's reshoring innovation, ideas, manufacturing back into the United States and creating a [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=371.35999999999996s)]
*  one of its kind effort to make sure that they successfully can relocate or expand into the [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=378.7s)]
*  U.S. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=384.85999999999996s)]
*  All right, Democratic Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico, always good to see [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=385.88s)]
*  you and thank you for being on the show this morning. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=390.82s)]
*  Thanks, Mika. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=394.42s)]
*  Thanks, Jo. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vIynke8Q8&t=395.42s)]
