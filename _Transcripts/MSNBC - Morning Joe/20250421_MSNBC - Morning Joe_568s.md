# 'Living by example': The remarkable legacy of Pope Francis
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [April 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ)
*  Good morning and welcome to Morning Joe. It's Monday, April 21st. We come on the air with [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=0.0s)]
*  breaking news. Pope Francis has passed away. The Vatican made the announcement early this [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  morning saying the 88-year-old Bishop of Rome returned to the house of the Father. Just [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=12.88s)]
*  yesterday, Francis made a surprise public appearance to bless thousands of people in [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=19.48s)]
*  St. Peter's Square. He then drove through the Pope Mobile. The Pope had been recovering from [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=25.8s)]
*  pneumonia. He was in the hospital for five weeks and was discharged less than a month ago. MSNBC's [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=33.24s)]
*  Chris Jansing has a look back at his life and legacy. Francis the pastor, gathering excited [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=41.88s)]
*  children on the Pope Mobile, ever the warm and humble priest he showed the world the day he was [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=51.44s)]
*  elected in 2013. Asking for prayers, dressed in a simple white cassock and an iron cross, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=56.4s)]
*  not the traditional gold. No surprise from a man who is Cardinal in Buenos Aires, lived in a small [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  apartment, rode the subway and cooked his own meals. He could understand regular people, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=72.02s)]
*  I'm an ordinary person, an ordinary guy with an extraordinary job and I think that the message [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=79.32s)]
*  was I am one of you. But then surprising many as Pope by bluntly taking on controversial causes, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=85.27999999999999s)]
*  speaking out against the invasion of Ukraine. Criticizing those who wouldn't wear masks during [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=92.16s)]
*  the pandemic, calling couples who had pets instead of children selfish and as the first [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  Pope to address a joint session of Congress, challenging the U.S. to open its arms to refugees [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=106.12s)]
*  and abolish the death penalty. Even earlier, just months after his election, saying something [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=111.72s)]
*  revolutionary for a Catholic church leader, that the church must welcome the LGBTQ community. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=118.28s)]
*  If a person is gay and seeks God and has goodwill, who am I to judge? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=124.56s)]
*  It's the Pope saying something that no other Pope has said, not only in terms of the implications [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=130.56s)]
*  of that statement, but the very willingness to speak with such kind of spontaneity and ease on [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=136.68s)]
*  a grave matter to reporters at the back of a plane. By that December, Time Magazine and the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=142.84s)]
*  Advocate named Francis their person of the year. He made the cover of Rolling Stone, Fortune's List [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=149.36s)]
*  of the most powerful people in the world, and he was the first as Pontiff to have an Instagram [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=155.12s)]
*  account, gaining a million followers in the first 12 hours. He was born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=160.68s)]
*  Buenos Aires, Argentina, the eldest of five children of Italian immigrants, as a young man [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=167.68s)]
*  holding jobs as a bouncer, a janitor, and studying chemistry before entering the seminary. When Pope [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=173.36s)]
*  Benedict retired, Bergoglio was seen as a cardinal whose time had passed, and at 76, too old. But [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=181.04s)]
*  after five ballots, white smoke. The first Jesuit ever elected Pope, the first from Latin America, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=188.48s)]
*  and the first in nearly 600 years to follow a retirement, a story so dramatic Hollywood couldn't [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=196.51999999999998s)]
*  resist. Francis took over a church with 1.3 billion members deeply divided over abortion, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=203.8s)]
*  divorce, the ordination of women, and married priests. He came into the church at a time in [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=217.24s)]
*  which there was tremendous crisis, both internally and externally, in terms of its reputation, and he [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=222.84s)]
*  in a sense rebranded the Catholic Church. At a time when the church really needed a facelift, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=227.76000000000002s)]
*  he provided it. He expanded roles for women in parishes and at the Vatican, but didn't budge on [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=232.4s)]
*  making them priests, considered allowing married priests in remote areas, but ultimately didn't, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=238.48000000000002s)]
*  and reaffirmed many times church teaching against abortion. Conservative Catholics argue Francis [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=244.8s)]
*  prioritized pastoral openness and outreach at the expense of church doctrine. Since our main work [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=251.52s)]
*  in the church is preparing people and calling people to heaven, we need to be able to tell them, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=258.56s)]
*  no, that's that's sinful conduct that will get you barred from going in the door. Other critics [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=264.72s)]
*  question whether his moves to toughen church laws dealing with sexual abuse by priests went far enough. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=270.72s)]
*  But with his appointment of 21 new and diverse cardinals in 2022, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=279.76s)]
*  Francis further shaped a church leadership tilting more toward the developing world [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=284.48s)]
*  and one that's more inclusive, willing to at least talk about tough issues. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=289.28000000000003s)]
*  Pope Francis understood that this was a world experiencing a lot of hurt, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=293.76s)]
*  and that hurt was of such a magnitude that it needs a divine healing. When failing health led [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=299.12s)]
*  to rumors of retirement, the pope who once ministered to the poor in the slums of Buenos Aires said simply, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=306.16s)]
*  leave a legacy of good, not just goods, as he had done himself, washing the feet of prison inmates, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=312.88000000000005s)]
*  embracing the sick, and shining a light on the Catholic mission of love and mercy. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=320.72s)]
*  Wow, we have so much to talk about here in terms of the legacy of Pope Francis, Richard Haas, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=327.6s)]
*  Jonathan Lemire, Joe and me starting off the show, and we're lining up, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=332.24s)]
*  guests as this breaking news unfolds before our eyes, and Joe, Pope Francis, the things that stand [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=335.92s)]
*  out to me was first just living by example, the simplicity of his life, even when he could have [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=343.92s)]
*  the comforts around him of anything of his choosing, he chose to live so simply with a [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=350.16s)]
*  focus on the humanity of all people, even and especially the poor. Also his focus on inclusivity, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=356.64s)]
*  his outreach to marginalized communities, those words, who am I to judge, will echo throughout [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=364.88s)]
*  his legacy. Go ahead. Oh yeah, and I was just going to say many on the hard right inside the [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=373.68s)]
*  church were shocked that this pope would actually borrow from Jesus Christ and living that simple [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=379.92s)]
*  life, borrow from Jesus Christ, and they were radical words when he said it, and it was like, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=390.0s)]
*  it sounded like the shot of a cannon. It just stunned everybody when the pope said, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=397.28s)]
*  who am I to judge? Now, why in the world would he say something that radical? I don't know, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=405.92s)]
*  maybe it's because that's exactly what Jesus said to the woman at the well when religious leaders [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=410.48s)]
*  were going to stone her to death, and Jesus said as they dropped their ox after saying, let he, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=417.12s)]
*  who is without sin, cast the first stone, Jesus turned and said, where are your accusers now? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=425.44s)]
*  Well, I also don't accuse you. Go and sin no more. And that's the thing, Mika, his legacy was [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=432.88s)]
*  remarkable in that Jesus reached out to those who were shunned by religious leaders in society, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=439.6s)]
*  the lepers, the tax collectors, the sinners like the woman at the well. And with Francis, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=447.76000000000005s)]
*  conservatives, many conservatives inside the church hated him for being Christ-like in that respect. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=455.92s)]
*  Just as the religious leaders of his day hated Jesus, but Francis was unbowed and being in [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=462.64000000000004s)]
*  his place, and he was not alone in that. He was inclusive while following the word of the gospels. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=469.44s)]
*  Many on the left were also disappointed, as we heard in Chris's package, that often his words [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=476.48s)]
*  would not lead to changing church doctrine. But even that approached the mirror, Jesus, who did [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=482.4s)]
*  save the woman at the well, said he held no judgment toward her and then said, go and sin no more. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=488.72s)]
*  And that stood the importance of opening wide the doors of the church to everybody, to those who were [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=497.92s)]
*  judged, to those that Jesus opened his faith to. And it really was, Mika, it really was really [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=507.44s)]
*  radical for the time in which he lived. And now the big question is moving forward, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=519.9200000000001s)]
*  how much of a direction does this church go back to? Does it go back to a legacy of [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=525.92s)]
*  doctrine and law over love and inclusivity? We will see how much of an impact Francis really did have [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=534.9599999999999s)]
*  on the long-term shape and direction of this church. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=543.1999999999999s)]
*  you [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIT-gio-ISQ&t=555.92s)]
