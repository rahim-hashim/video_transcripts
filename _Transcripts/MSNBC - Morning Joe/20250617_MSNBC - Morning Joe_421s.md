# 'He has reversed his word': Senator slams RFK Jr. for replacing CDC vaccine panel
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU)
*  More news now. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is facing backlash after [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=0.0s)]
*  his decision last week to retire all 17 members of a CDC vaccine advisory panel and replace [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=6.28s)]
*  them with hand-picked choices, including some known vaccine skeptics. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=15.540000000000001s)]
*  Our next guest is introducing a bill to reverse Kennedy's action and make it impossible for [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=21.06s)]
*  any other HHS secretary to do the same. Joining us now, Democratic Senator Lisa Blunt, Rochester [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=27.84s)]
*  of Delaware. Thank you very much for coming on the show. Tell us more about the bill and [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=34.36s)]
*  also how much support does it have? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  Well, first of all, thank you so much for having me on this morning. You know, this [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=41.6s)]
*  is a really serious matter. Right now, it's been 60 years that this committee has been [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  in place, providing us with data-driven, science-based information to help us have access to safe [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=53.16s)]
*  and healthy vaccines. And Secretary Kennedy came before our committees. I am on the help [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=63.31999999999999s)]
*  committee and he also came before the finance committee and said that he would follow the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=71.12s)]
*  science and that this committee would be intact and he has reversed his word. And so [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=77.08s)]
*  that means that individuals who are counting on this information, whether it's for their [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=85.16s)]
*  children and their immunizations to their parents and maybe with flu season coming up, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=90.88s)]
*  or even us in Delaware, we have avian flu as an issue that we care about. We have more [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=96.52s)]
*  chickens than people in our state. And so this is an important, serious issue. And so other [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  members of the committee and myself have come together and written to the secretary, but [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=108.52s)]
*  also put forward this bill called the Vaccine Act. And it really is to make sure that we [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=114.0s)]
*  reinstate that confidence that we have had through Democrats and Republicans in the past [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=120.12s)]
*  because this is a serious matter and it will affect people's lives. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=126.36s)]
*  Senator, this was thoroughly predictable to anyone who knew anything about RFK Junior's [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=131.72s)]
*  record on vaccines. And he did give assurances that he would not touch this panel. So are you [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=138.84s)]
*  finding any Republican support at all for this legislation? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, I can tell you that I had the opportunity to even talk to the chairman of our committee, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=152.51999999999998s)]
*  Senator Cassidy, who not only is the chairman and a Republican, but he's also a medical doctor [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=159.28s)]
*  and share our concerns. But the reason why we put forward this legislation is because [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=166.08s)]
*  concerns aren't enough. And so we are now in the process. We just introduced this bill with [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=171.76000000000002s)]
*  Senator Lujan as well as Senator Warnock. And we've got 19 others who have also come on, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=177.28s)]
*  signed on to the bill. Any Republicans? Not yet. But that's what this moment is about. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  We need Republicans to stand up to this chaos and craziness, just like we need them to stand up [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=189.52s)]
*  for the other things that we are seeing as well from this administration. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=195.6s)]
*  Senator, good morning. I want to shift gears and turn you to the story we were just discussing, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=200.24s)]
*  the immigration raids, mixed messaging from the White House, first suggesting that some of these [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=204.56s)]
*  farms would be spared. Now, perhaps not. The president over the weekend, making very clear, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=212.08s)]
*  he's targeting blue cities for these raids here and potentially sending the National Guard to [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=217.36s)]
*  protect them. Given what we've just saw in Los Angeles, given what we're hearing from the White [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=222.72000000000003s)]
*  House, what are your constituents telling you? What are you seeing there as to what could come? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=226.56s)]
*  Well, first of all, in Delaware, I served as secretary of labor and head of state personnel. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=232.64000000000001s)]
*  Jobs and the economy are top of mind for me. As we look at this situation and what he's doing, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=238.56s)]
*  there are a couple of things that we have to look at. One is the impact on our economy [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=246.4s)]
*  and what he's doing. The second is the politicization of our National Guard, our [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=251.44s)]
*  military. We don't need that in a moment where we are seeing violence that is perpetuated [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=257.76s)]
*  from a political perspective. As a matter of fact, that needs to not even be a partisan issue [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=266.64s)]
*  either. It needs to be Democrats and Republicans who say that we don't condone that. As we watch [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=270.96s)]
*  this president, I think, again, you see it at the Department of Health and Human Services, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=277.03999999999996s)]
*  you see it in his trade policy with tariffs, you see it in everything that he does. The two sees [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=282.47999999999996s)]
*  chaos and confusion. Right now, what we need is certainty. Again, I'm calling on my Republican [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=288.4s)]
*  colleagues to step up, to stand up, especially in this moment. Democratic Senator Lisa Blunt, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=294.88s)]
*  Rochester of Delaware, thank you very much for coming on the show this morning. We appreciate it. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=302.88s)]
*  Thank you. Mike Barnicle, you've known R.F.K. Jr. as I have for a very long time. I'm curious [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=308.15999999999997s)]
*  your thoughts on him firing everybody on this panel, appointing vaccine skeptics. I just wonder [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=316.88s)]
*  where this ends up, how far he goes in this campaign to discourage vaccines, the same vaccines [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=325.6s)]
*  that reportedly he made sure all of his children had. Well, I think, Joe, you just put your finger [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=334.96s)]
*  in the most significant aspect of his appointment. I mean, there are several cabinet members, we talk [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=340.88s)]
*  about them nearly every day, that present some issues, I think, to large numbers of Americans, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=345.52s)]
*  Pete Hegseth, Kristi Noem, their behavior in office. I would suggest and submit that [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=350.88s)]
*  Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s appointment is the most dangerous of the cabinet appointments. And I say [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=356.79999999999995s)]
*  that thinking of my grandchildren, because I think he poses a threat to normal health conditions [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=362.32s)]
*  of young kids in this country, and even of adults in this country, but specifically young kids, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=368.96s)]
*  measles vaccine, the ordinary vaccines that kids take going to grammar schools and high schools, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=374.24s)]
*  things like that. He stands, his word is not his word. When he says something, it is meaningless. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=380.32s)]
*  You can ask a couple of United States senators, his word is meaningless. And that's a real problem, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=388.32s)]
*  because he is in fact dealing with the health and welfare of millions of Americans. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSNnZk_jU&t=393.6s)]
