# 'What's he talking about?' Joe dismantles Trump official's 'socialist regime' rant
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys)
*  So let's get to the news at the second hour of Morning Joe. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=0.0s)]
*  Canada's newly elected Prime Minister Mark Carney will meet with President Trump today [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=4.1s)]
*  at the White House. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=8.72s)]
*  It comes amid heightened tensions between the two countries over Trump's tariffs and [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=9.72s)]
*  the president's repeated suggestion that Canada become the 51st U.S. state. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  Carney's office says the meeting will focus on trade and the security relationship between [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=21.48s)]
*  both countries. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=27.16s)]
*  President Trump spoke yesterday about what he expects to discuss in the meeting today. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=28.98s)]
*  I don't know if he's coming to see me. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=33.26s)]
*  I'm not sure what he wants to see me about, but I guess he wants to make a deal. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=35.7s)]
*  Everybody does. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=39.46s)]
*  They all want to make a deal because we have something that they all want. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=40.66s)]
*  We have something that they all want. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=45.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick voiced skepticism about a potential deal being [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=47.260000000000005s)]
*  reached. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=54.58s)]
*  I think it's really complex. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=55.58s)]
*  I think this is really complex because they have been basically feeding off of us for [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=57.94s)]
*  decades upon decades upon decades. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=62.42s)]
*  They have their socialist regime and it's basically feeding off of America. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=65.46s)]
*  The president calls that out all the time. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=70.5s)]
*  Why do we make cars in Canada? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=72.25999999999999s)]
*  Why do we do our films in Canada? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=74.82s)]
*  Come on. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=77.46s)]
*  So I think the president's going to have, I think it's going to be a fascinating meeting. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=78.46s)]
*  I'm glad I'm going to be there listening, but it's going to be a fascinating meeting [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=81.98s)]
*  tomorrow. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=85.02s)]
*  Let's see how it works out so perfectly. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=86.02s)]
*  I mean seriously, did he go to school? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=88.02s)]
*  What, Nick? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=90.5s)]
*  Yeah, I went to Alabama. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=91.5s)]
*  I took Econ 101. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=93.61999999999999s)]
*  I was reading Sports Illustrated in the back and I think I got a C-. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=94.61999999999999s)]
*  I think I get the point. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=97.78s)]
*  You get the point. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=99.78s)]
*  I mean he was obviously two roads behind me reading something else and not paying attention [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=102.22s)]
*  because he was saying, oh they steal from us. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=106.69999999999999s)]
*  What's he talking about? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=110.14s)]
*  It's called free trade. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=111.62s)]
*  It's called a global system where we benefit from what Canada does well. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=114.54s)]
*  Canada benefits from us. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=122.26s)]
*  This whole idea. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=123.58000000000001s)]
*  Him sitting there, I understand if you're trying to get a better deal on tariffs, I [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=125.38000000000001s)]
*  get that. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=129.94s)]
*  But for Howard Ludnick to sit there and act so completely ignorant about why certain car [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=130.94s)]
*  parts might be made in Canada better, you know, because it's cheaper for American consumers [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=136.3s)]
*  and why we may do certain things better here and we export to Canada. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=141.38s)]
*  I mean, who's he trying to convince there? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=145.9s)]
*  You know, well it could be that he actually has a lack of knowledge about the topics you [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=149.86s)]
*  were just talking about. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=153.38s)]
*  Isn't he like a billionaire? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=154.38s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=155.38s)]
*  Let me ask you. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=156.38s)]
*  You would know this better than anybody here at this table. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=157.38s)]
*  The word is that Ludnick and Witkoff, the president's personal negotiator, are the two [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=160.54000000000002s)]
*  weakest links in the Trump administration hierarchy at the top. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=165.82s)]
*  There's been some internal pushback on both. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=170.26000000000002s)]
*  We've seen Ludnick definitely been isolated in some of these trade talks in the last few [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=172.14000000000001s)]
*  weeks. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=176.46s)]
*  Scott Bessent, the Treasury Secretary, has stepped more to the forefront. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=177.46s)]
*  They've also pushed Peter Navarro aside. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=179.98000000000002s)]
*  But this is a constant jockeying for Trump's attention and what he wants. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=181.66000000000003s)]
*  And it's also the mixed signals we're getting here. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=185.98000000000002s)]
*  I mean, yes, it's unlikely that a deal gets struck today. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=188.26000000000002s)]
*  But the administration keeps trying to prime the pump saying, oh, deals are close, deals [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=191.66000000000003s)]
*  are close, deals are close with a variety of countries. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=194.70000000000002s)]
*  But when they're pressed for details, turns out deals aren't that close. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=197.06s)]
*  I mean, it's the progress made with India that's been reported a little bit with Japan. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=199.94s)]
*  But nothing is on the horizon. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=204.74s)]
*  And we have seen the markets have stabilized some, but only some. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=206.42000000000002s)]
*  And I think there's a real concern here that the 30-day pause is going to run out. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=209.94s)]
*  And then we may have more strife here. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=218.38s)]
*  There's real pressure to get something done. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=221.38s)]
*  And yet nothing seems that close. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=223.18s)]
*  I think I'm in the minority here. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=225.10000000000002s)]
*  I really do think this is all not a bait and switch. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=226.78s)]
*  I really think this still is negotiations. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=229.9s)]
*  You see the markets went up to 40, 41. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=233.86s)]
*  They were down to 36, 37. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=236.74s)]
*  And the reason I say that is the people that go in and talk tough or don't let Donald Trump [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=239.58s)]
*  run over them, he deals with them. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=246.82000000000002s)]
*  Like you look at the Mexican president, Scheinbaum, they have a good relationship, right? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=248.82000000000002s)]
*  And from everything I've heard inside the White House, Donald Trump has had good calls [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=254.38s)]
*  with Mark Carney. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=257.78000000000003s)]
*  He likes Mark Carney. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=258.78000000000003s)]
*  He respects him because, you know, he's done a heck of a lot of things and he understands [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=259.78000000000003s)]
*  the process and he's not going to get run over. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=264.82s)]
*  So who knows? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=267.66s)]
*  Maybe Leitnick going on there saying all of that nonsense is just to set up negotiations [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=269.38s)]
*  with Mark Carney. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=274.94s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=275.94s)]
*  Maybe it goes badly. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=276.94s)]
*  But you look at what happened with, you know, British Prime Minister Starmor. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=277.94s)]
*  They had a good relationship. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=283.3s)]
*  He has a good relationship with Macron. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=285.02000000000004s)]
*  We'll see what happens with Carney and if that leads to a deal at some point. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=287.42s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, Donald Trump's default setting in a negotiation is to start by punching the [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=290.78000000000003s)]
*  person across the table in the face, dazing them a little bit. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=295.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=298.3s)]
*  See how they respond. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=299.3s)]
*  Now we can talk. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=300.3s)]
*  It's a strange welcome, Claire McCaskill, for one of our closest allies, for the president [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=301.82s)]
*  to say, I don't know why he's coming. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=305.94s)]
*  Apparently he wants to talk to me. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=307.58000000000004s)]
*  Everybody wants to talk to me. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=308.90000000000003s)]
*  I have your commerce secretary call it a socialist regime and attack Canada and our trading relationship [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=309.9s)]
*  with them. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=315.73999999999995s)]
*  So it's certainly, I guess, a different approach. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=316.73999999999995s)]
*  It remains to be seen if it works because for all the talk about this being a negotiation, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=319.58s)]
*  there haven't been many deals, if any, negotiated around these tariffs. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=324.85999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, well, maybe the reason he's coming is to thank him. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=328.85999999999996s)]
*  Carney has one person that he really needs to thank for getting elected, and that's Donald [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=333.38s)]
*  Trump. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=339.0s)]
*  It is the anti Donald Trump sentiment in Canada that saved Carney and his party. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=340.0s)]
*  They were like 20 points down until Trump decided he was going to pick a fight with [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=348.4s)]
*  our closest friend and ally. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=353.96s)]
*  And now we are very much out of favor with Canadians and Carney knows it. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=356.24s)]
*  So Carney is certainly not going to come in there and bend the knee. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=362.64s)]
*  That would be political suicide for him. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=366.6s)]
*  But I'll tell you who hasn't called. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=368.44s)]
*  She hasn't called. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=370.6s)]
*  China has not called and Donald Trump knows it. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=372.28000000000003s)]
*  And that is really telling, you know, the difference between Donald Trump and the guy [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=375.76000000000005s)]
*  who runs China is the guy who runs China doesn't care about polls. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=381.28000000000003s)]
*  And they're busy opening other markets and really coalescing a whole bunch of folks into [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=387.28000000000003s)]
*  trade agreements while Donald Trump is stubbornly waiting for somehow to call and say, yeah, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=392.7s)]
*  you're right. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyqM3q5HGys&t=399.46s)]
