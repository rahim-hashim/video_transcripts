# Trump's 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminum imports take effect, Europe retaliates
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [March 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE)
*  What a day yesterday. I mean, we had what was going on in Saudi Arabia with the negotiations. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=0.0s)]
*  That is very good news for the Ukrainians, especially they get the intel and they also [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=6.32s)]
*  get a big, and get the military. But the Wall Street Journal basically says it all, talking [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=11.36s)]
*  about stocks continuing to fall. Another volatile session, the headline, U.S.-Canada trade war [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=19.78s)]
*  hits, you know, twists and turns. And again, trillions of dollars wiped out. Front page [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=30.12s)]
*  of the New York Times, of course, talking about this important breakthrough yesterday [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=38.68s)]
*  in the Ukrainian-U.S. negotiations. And now we wait for Russia. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=43.16s)]
*  To see what happens. With us, we have the co-host of our fourth hour, John Van Lemeer. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=49.88s)]
*  He is a contributing writer at The Atlantic, covering the White House and national politics. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=54.72s)]
*  Columnist and associate editor for The Washington Post, David Ignatius is here, and writer-at-large [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=60.44s)]
*  for The New York Times, Elizabeth Buhmiller joins us this morning. Good to have you all. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=66.12s)]
*  President Trump's 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminum imports are now in effect. The [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=71.72s)]
*  taxes will affect Canada, Australia, and the European Union and others. The EU has [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=79.16s)]
*  already announced countermeasures, which will go into effect on April 1st. But Australia's [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=86.11999999999999s)]
*  prime minister said the country will not impose reciprocal tariffs on U.S. imports because [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=91.6s)]
*  it would only inflate prices for Australian consumers. Late yesterday, Trump backed off [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=97.84s)]
*  on raising tariffs on metals from Canada to 50 percent after the premier of Ontario [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=103.04s)]
*  said he would pause a surcharge on electricity exports to the U.S. The Canadian government, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=110.28s)]
*  however, has promised to retaliate against the 25 percent tariffs on its metals. The [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=117.16000000000001s)]
*  president's also reiterated his desire for Canada to become the 51st state. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=123.32000000000001s)]
*  We spend $200 billion a year subsidizing Canada. We don't have to do that. And frankly, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=130.8s)]
*  the way that gets solved is Canada should honestly become our 51st state. We wouldn't [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=137.28s)]
*  have a northern border problem. We wouldn't have a tariff problem. Canada would be great [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=142.66000000000003s)]
*  as our cherished 51st state. You wouldn't have to worry about borders. You wouldn't [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=148.06s)]
*  have to worry about anything. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=152.14000000000001s)]
*  And by the way, Canada is very highly taxed, and we're very low tax. We're considered a [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=154.52s)]
*  low tax nation because of me, because I cut the taxes so low. So the people of Canada [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=159.1s)]
*  would pay much less tax. It makes a lot of sense. And by the way, when you take away [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=164.42s)]
*  that artificial line that looks like it was done with a ruler, and that's what it was. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=169.1s)]
*  Some guy sat there years ago and they said, rah. Well, when you take away that and you [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=174.01999999999998s)]
*  look at that beautiful formation of Canada and the United States, there is no place anywhere [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=178.62s)]
*  in the world that looks like that. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=186.34s)]
*  Elizabeth, so many people have been thinking and saying, oh, Donald Trump's joking about [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=189.06s)]
*  Greenland. He's not really serious. This is opening negotiations are the Panama Canal [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=198.22000000000003s)]
*  are fill in the blank. But especially Canada, that was always dismissed as a joke. Prime [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=204.22000000000003s)]
*  Minister Trudeau caught in a hot Mike moment told his advisers and people close to him. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=211.26000000000002s)]
*  He's not joking. We have to take this threat seriously. And certainly yesterday in the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=218.62s)]
*  middle of an economic collapse, Donald Trump goes back to saying we wouldn't have this [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=225.62s)]
*  tariff problem if you all would just agree to be our 51st state. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=232.82s)]
*  It is very hard to believe, but he is he seems to be increasingly serious. The strange thing, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=238.02s)]
*  though, is what it's done. It's made the Liberal Party is one in Canada. And should Canada [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=245.94s)]
*  become part of the United States, there would never be a Republican president elected again, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=252.1s)]
*  because it's a very liberal country and they would all be Democrats. It's loopy. I you [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=256.26s)]
*  know, people still seem to think that he's doing this just for for effect, that he is [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=262.18s)]
*  trying to get major concessions out of Canada. But right now it has had the opposite effect [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=266.58s)]
*  in Canada. He is in America is increasingly unpopular in Canada, obviously. Same thing [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=271.94s)]
*  with Greenland. I think, although there seems to be, you know, Greenland wants to be independent [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=277.14s)]
*  from Denmark and but also there's but also welcome, you know, close relations with the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=282.1s)]
*  United States. So that is less crazy than Canada. But but right now that's where the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=286.58s)]
*  president is. And it's a whole big question about which also, you know, business executives [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=291.06s)]
*  are having is, you know, how they didn't take him seriously about this tariff on the tariffs [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=295.62s)]
*  he was going to impose. They didn't think he was going to do it. They thought it was [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=301.38s)]
*  just negotiations. And it turns out he is serious, at least for now. And they are very, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=304.65999999999997s)]
*  very rattled. And they're calling the White House in a panic. Well, I mean, it's I mean, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=310.1s)]
*  I just don't know how anybody could be surprised. This is something that, again, he's said he was [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=316.9s)]
*  going to do this for 40 years. And I've been hearing from people on Wall Street. I've been [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=321.94s)]
*  hearing talk to see other shocked. I can I can you believe where have you been for the last [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=326.18s)]
*  like year? He's promised to do all of these things. Oh, yeah. Well, and on tariffs, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=333.62s)]
*  he's been talking about it for 40 years. So again, the CEOs and you know, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=339.86s)]
*  found out. Yeah, I mean, he meant he meant he meant what he said. And and so I just I [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=348.34000000000003s)]
*  don't want to hear. Oh, I'm so shocked. Yeah, I'm losing money. There's a lot of gobsmacked CEOs [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=356.02s)]
*  and business leaders saying I didn't think he would do this. And I think increasingly people [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=362.18s)]
*  are understanding that he is serious about many of the ideas that he has put on the table that [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=366.5s)]
*  he did during the campaign. And I will say, well, tried our best. I mean, if if people are [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=373.7s)]
*  constantly watching news organizations that follow only what Trump says and not necessarily [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=383.62s)]
*  the facts, then they will find out the hard way. Well, I mean, again, it's just a Jonathan [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=392.5s)]
*  Amir. We've had people on this show regulars on this show that said, oh, my God, I'm surprised [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=398.42s)]
*  he actually did this. He's been saying he was going to do this since 1987. So if you were a CEO [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=402.5s)]
*  or if you've somebody that's invested in the market, we said it here repeatedly. He was serious. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=410.58s)]
*  Be careful with the economy. We have the strongest economy in the world. Don't screw around and find [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=416.74s)]
*  out. You have to be careful. Like we said it day in, day out, day in and day out. And you actually [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=424.82s)]
*  talk to CEOs and investors and people in Wall Street who are shocked that Donald Trump's actually [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=432.58s)]
*  doing what he said he was going to do on the campaign and for 50 years. Yeah, the Wall Street [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=438.5s)]
*  and business leaders sort of made a bet this past campaign that Trump would make these promises [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=444.02s)]
*  during the year and some things to pro growth, cutting taxes alike. They approved of like he'll [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=448.9s)]
*  do that. But he also talked about these tariffs. He talked about slashing immigration, things that [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=454.58s)]
*  these business leaders opposed. But the bet they made was, oh, that's just rhetoric. That's just [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=458.98s)]
*  bluster. That's just thing he says to get the crowd cheering at a rally. He won't follow through [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=464.1s)]
*  on that. Well, that's bet they're wrong. That's what's happened here. And we have learned, first [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=468.5s)]
*  of all, as you point out, tariffs, his belief in tariffs is one of his few really consistently held [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=472.58000000000004s)]
*  ideologies. He's done that since the 1980s. But more than that, this past we have learned from his [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=478.98s)]
*  first administration and particularly this past campaign, when he makes these promises, he tends [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=483.86s)]
*  to follow through. He tells us what he's going to do. He's actually far more transparent than people [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=488.58s)]
*  want to give him credit for. There's not a lot of hidden hand here. There's not a lot of, if ever, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=494.82s)]
*  a three or four dimensional chess. This Donald Trump, when he says he's going to do it more times [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=499.38s)]
*  than not, he does. And we're seeing the impact now. We have, as we'll get into in a moment, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=504.82s)]
*  you have markets again rattled by these policies. It's chaotic. It's inconsistent. It seems to change [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=510.65999999999997s)]
*  by the hour. And we know, Joe and Mika, that we've had business leaders, Steve Ratner, again, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=516.66s)]
*  joined us yesterday saying how much it's about consistency and predictability. That's what the [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=521.4599999999999s)]
*  markets need. That's what corporations need. Well, that's exactly what they're not getting. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=525.6999999999999s)]
*  And again, what everybody knew they were not going to get for the past year or what everybody [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=531.14s)]
*  should have known, that they're going to get these tariffs. And he negotiated. Again, there's no [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=535.4599999999999s)]
*  100 year plan. He's going to negotiate the way he negotiates, and it's going to take wild twists and turns. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ZvrdnxQSE&t=542.34s)]
