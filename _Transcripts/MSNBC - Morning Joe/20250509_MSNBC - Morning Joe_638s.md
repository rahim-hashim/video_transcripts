# 'Gift to a world on fire': Pope Leo's message of 'dignity' a great weapon, says Mike Barnicle
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0)
*  right now, MSNBC contributor Mike Barnacle. You know, Mike, we have seen too often over [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=0.0s)]
*  the past 30, 40 years in America some of those calling themselves Christian, the most high-profile, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  talking about, you know, prosperity gospels, lifting up the richest, the most powerful. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=13.36s)]
*  We've seen preachers and priests run to power and be obsessed by it. That's one of the extraordinary [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=21.48s)]
*  things about Francis, who of course focused on what Jesus focused on and who Jesus focused [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=29.44s)]
*  on, the poor. But here we have Leo also. And if you look at Leo's life and what he did [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=36.28s)]
*  in one of the poorest parishes in Peru and what he did as a missionary, what his work [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=45.36s)]
*  is focused on, it has been on those that Jesus said that Christians should focus on. The [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=57.6s)]
*  Matthew 25 example we've been talking about, it was Jesus that, of course, the lepers, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=65.36s)]
*  Zacchaeus, the woman at the well, those that were left out, those were the first that Jesus [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=73.92s)]
*  embraced throughout the gospels. And here with this new American pope, this pope who has taken [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=83.44s)]
*  the name Leo, we have someone who follows in that tradition instead of, unfortunately, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=90.72s)]
*  some examples we've seen not only in America but across the West where the poor, the disadvantaged, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=98.8s)]
*  those left on the margins of society are the ones ignored by religious leaders too often. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=106.4s)]
*  You know, Joe, you're absolutely right in that apt description of the new pope. And it's [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=113.6s)]
*  remindful of the fact that the Lord often moves in mysterious ways. And it is perhaps true that he [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=121.84s)]
*  has given us in Leo XIV a gift to a world on fire. This particular pope in his introductory [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=129.6s)]
*  remarks to the crowd at St. Peter's yesterday, he said, evil will not win. And he indicated that [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=138.32s)]
*  the church, the Catholic church, should remain and get stronger as a missionary church. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  And he said it ought to remain close to those who suffer. And that's what he's been talking about [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=152.56s)]
*  for years as a priest, as a cardinal, and now as pope. And one thing that he does, Joe, that I [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=158.64s)]
*  think is going to have a huge impact on the culture and the politics of this world of ours [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=165.6s)]
*  is, I think, going to speak out consistently with the use of the word dignity, dignity of the [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=171.12s)]
*  individual. We know, we live with it every day, that the world is surrounded, and we're surrounded, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=178.72s)]
*  by people in public life who use language as an assault weapon to damage others, to demean others, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=185.44s)]
*  because they disagree with them ideologically, not religiously, ideologically. That has got to end [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=193.2s)]
*  if we are to continue to thrive as a human race. And this particular pope, given his roots in [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=200.56s)]
*  Chicago, he is an American. It's incredible that we have an American pope. But given his roots, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=206.56s)]
*  and he chooses Leo XIV as his papal name, I don't think that's an accident, because Leo XIII, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=212.95999999999998s)]
*  we've referenced this yesterday and earlier today, I imagine you've talked about it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=220.48s)]
*  Leo XIII wrote an encyclical called Rerum Novarum in the late 1890s, right at the turn of the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=224.79999999999998s)]
*  century. And it was dedicated to people who work for a living, people like today who work for a [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=232.0s)]
*  living, people who come home from work and take a shower instead of taking a shower before they go [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=238.56s)]
*  to work, people with calloused hands and dangerous lives because they make minimum wage, people from [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=243.28s)]
*  other countries who came here looking for liberty, looking for affluence. And affluence to them [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=250.24s)]
*  is food on the table. This particular pope is their champion. And I think the way he behaves, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=255.84s)]
*  the way he speaks, the way he speaks to the world is going to be a powerful, powerful weapon, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=261.84000000000003s)]
*  a great weapon against what we're confronted with each and every day. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=267.52s)]
*  Well, and Pope Leo XIII came along at a time, the beginning of the industrial revolution, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=272.40000000000003s)]
*  when many Americans were being left behind. Here we have, hopefully, of the XIV also coming at an [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=280.64s)]
*  extraordinary time in our development as a global economy. And again, talking about the inclusive [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=288.40000000000003s)]
*  nature of not only Francis, but Willie, what we've heard so far about Pope Leo, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=302.8s)]
*  just some, you look at what Francis said, the church is for everyone. And yesterday, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=311.92s)]
*  it was Pope Leo who said, God loves everyone, all of us, again, all-inclusive, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=320.16s)]
*  just as we said before about Jesus, throwing his arms around the least among us, those very people [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=327.44s)]
*  on the edges of society. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=336.8s)]
*  Yeah, and if you read everything that this new pope has said, has written, if you hear everything [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=339.6s)]
*  he's said over the years, he keeps coming back to humility, and that is walking with the people, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=344.96000000000004s)]
*  as you say, suffering with the people. He believes that is the job, that is the role. And he's been a [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=349.76s)]
*  missionary in Peru for about 40 years now doing exactly that kind of work. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=355.12s)]
*  Let's bring to the conversation Father Robert Hagen. He is the 41st prior provincial at the [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=360.32s)]
*  Augustinian province of St. Thomas of Villanova and a longtime friend of Pope Leo XIV. Father, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=365.28s)]
*  thanks so much for joining us this morning. We really appreciate it. We can talk about the [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=371.91999999999996s)]
*  Villanova connection in a moment. We believe he has blessed our Nova Knicks right now with [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=375.59999999999997s)]
*  Jalen Brunson and the boys, but we'll put that to the side for a minute. This is a man you know, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=380.24s)]
*  a man you know very well. What was your reaction to the news yesterday? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=385.52s)]
*  Much like everybody else, we were flabbergasted. I think if you read any kind of speculation, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=390.48s)]
*  you saw maybe he was on a list or a short list, but to see him emerge from that balcony, it was [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=396.32s)]
*  as if a family member stepped up there, and we were just overcome by joy and gratitude. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=402.0s)]
*  To think of the man that we know, the humility, the intellect, the desire to help the poor, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=409.44s)]
*  and to see those gifts now be shared with the world as his Augustinian brothers, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=417.36s)]
*  we're incredibly proud and happy for the impact that he will have on our world. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=423.36s)]
*  Father, so much has been said and written in these last, what, 12, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=432.8s)]
*  16 hours or so about Pope Leo XIV, a man you know as Bob. What should we know about him that [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=436.16s)]
*  has not been said? People have parsed through his politics, his public comments, the way he's lived [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=443.36s)]
*  his life. What should our viewers know about him this morning? I think he really is a people person. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=449.36s)]
*  I think much will be made of his intellect, his capacity for languages, his study. He is a scholar, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=456.48s)]
*  but at the same time, he's incredibly relatable. He loves people, and I would not underplay his [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=464.32s)]
*  Augustinian roots that much of his formation and foundation comes from the life of Augustine. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=472.48s)]
*  Augustine was made a bishop. He didn't necessarily want that role, but he accepted it to serve the [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=479.76s)]
*  people, and he said, for you, I'm a bishop. With you, I'm a Christian. And so I think what people [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=485.92s)]
*  will find in Pope Leo is a leadership style that is very much with and among the people, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=492.8s)]
*  not so much to lord power over and above us. Father, good morning. Certainly much has been [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=500.24s)]
*  made of the fact the new pope is a White Sox fan, which I guess makes sense, being a champion of [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=506.15999999999997s)]
*  the downtrodden. But let's talk also about, it was striking to me that the way the Vatican framed [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=510.64s)]
*  his biography yesterday as not the first United States pope, rather the second American pope [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=517.52s)]
*  following Pope Francis, because so much of this time in Peru is so important here, and the work [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=522.96s)]
*  he did there as a parish priest among the very poor. Tell us more about that time, what you know [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=528.72s)]
*  of it, and how formulative it was for him. Once again, I think it could be safe to say that [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=534.32s)]
*  most people don't aspire to be pope. I think in the rule of St. Augustine, we're called to a very [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=541.76s)]
*  simple premise, love God and love your neighbor. And so I think for all of Father Bob's life, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=548.0799999999999s)]
*  that's simply what he was doing. And so we Augustinians have a mission, have missions around [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=556.24s)]
*  the world, one place being in Peru with the poorest of the poor. And so he went there for the sole [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=562.64s)]
*  purpose to love his neighbor and to help those who would need a hand. And so I think during the [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=569.04s)]
*  course of those 10 years there, he recognized, I think, what is a core value and maybe not so [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=576.4s)]
*  much celebrated in our country, we celebrate the value of independence, right, to be able to pick [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=582.8s)]
*  yourself up and move forward. And that's certainly a value. But the value of dependence, that we need [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=589.92s)]
*  each other. We need God and we need our fellow sisters and brothers to help one another move [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=596.64s)]
*  through life. And so I think Pope Leo will bring that value with him as a celebration of dependence [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=602.4s)]
*  and reminding all of the people how much we need each other and are called to help one another and [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=610.48s)]
*  love one another. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=616.64s)]
*  you [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY3TUXETJR0&t=626.64s)]
