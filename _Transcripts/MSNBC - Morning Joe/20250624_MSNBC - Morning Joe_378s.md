# 'Heartbreaking' but 'empowering': Abortion health care advocates gather in D.C.
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA)
*  Welcome back. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=0.0s)]
*  Abortion health care advocates are gathering in the nation's capital this morning for the [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=2.38s)]
*  free and just storyteller summit, marking three years to the day since the Supreme Court [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=5.64s)]
*  overturned Roe v. Wade. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=11.36s)]
*  One hundred patients, providers and advocates from 32 states are participating in the three-day [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=13.72s)]
*  event sharing personal stories about how they've been directly affected by abortion bans. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=18.2s)]
*  And then later today, they'll head to Capitol Hill to meet with members of Congress. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=24.84s)]
*  Joining us now is one of the abortion rights advocates participating in the summit, Amanda [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=29.92s)]
*  Zyrowski. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=33.88s)]
*  She was the lead plaintiff in the Center for Reproductive Rights lawsuit that challenged [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=34.88s)]
*  the abortion ban in Texas, a ban that the Texas Supreme Court ultimately upheld last [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=39.6s)]
*  year. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=45.6s)]
*  Amanda, good morning. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=46.6s)]
*  Thank you for joining us this morning. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=47.6s)]
*  Let's just start with this moment in time. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=49.68000000000001s)]
*  Your personal story, if you will, but also here three years since Roe v. Wade was overturned, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=53.36s)]
*  sort of the landscape that so many women, not just women, that so many people in America [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=60.16s)]
*  now face over reproductive health care. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=64.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=67.0s)]
*  First of all, thank you so much for having me. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=69.0s)]
*  So my story starts about three years ago when I suffered under the extreme abortion ban [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=71.66s)]
*  in Texas. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=76.86s)]
*  And in the three years since that, it's just been heartbreaking to watch what is happening [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=78.0s)]
*  in this country and how our restrictions are expanding all across the country. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=83.2s)]
*  And I'm here as part of this Free and Just Storytellers Summit because there are so many [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=88.60000000000001s)]
*  people who have been impacted in the last three years. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=93.04s)]
*  And so although it's a heartbreaking thing to commemorate, it's also very empowering [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=96.0s)]
*  to be in community with a hundred storytellers that are here advocating for our rights and [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=100.22s)]
*  standing up for what we believe in. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=105.54s)]
*  Amanda, this is Susan Page. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=106.84s)]
*  So it's been three years. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=109.24000000000001s)]
*  At the time of this decision, there was a sense among, I think, some abortion rights [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=111.48s)]
*  advocates that this was a silver bullet for Democrats, the issue of abortion rights, in [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=115.0s)]
*  some of the early contests after the decision that seemed to be true. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  But you don't get the sense that it's defining American politics or certainly didn't drive [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=124.52000000000001s)]
*  a winning coalition last November for Democrats and the presidential race. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=129.2s)]
*  Can you talk about what's happened to the impact with voters of this issue over these [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=134.08s)]
*  last three years? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=139.0s)]
*  Well, I think it actually was quite impactful in the last election cycle. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=140.48s)]
*  I think when we see abortion access on the ballot, we see it win. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=144.95999999999998s)]
*  And we see that time and again. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=149.0s)]
*  We had initiatives on ballot measures in 10 states and we won in seven of those 10 states. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  And we actually won in Florida as well with a majority, but we didn't reach this arbitrary [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=157.01999999999998s)]
*  threshold that we needed to. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=160.88s)]
*  So although we maybe didn't connect the dots between how the state of affairs that we're [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=162.76s)]
*  in today is connected to President Trump and his last administration, I think we do see [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=168.48000000000002s)]
*  that people vote for abortion access and we just have more work to do in connecting the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=174.20000000000002s)]
*  dots between showing folks that who they vote for ultimately is how we get here. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=178.04000000000002s)]
*  Amanda, it's Sam Stein. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  Just picking up on that, on the policy front, obviously I don't think anyone anticipates [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=184.86s)]
*  a sort of a federal right to an abortion passing through this Congress and being signed into [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=189.60000000000002s)]
*  law by this president who said, let's leave it up to the state. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=193.20000000000002s)]
*  So I'm sort of curious, where do you see the sort of biggest breakthroughs for the abortion [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=196.32s)]
*  rights community? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=201.42s)]
*  Is it going to be legislative? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=202.42000000000002s)]
*  Will it be in the state? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=203.42000000000002s)]
*  Will it be judicial? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=204.42000000000002s)]
*  And where are you focusing your resources? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=205.64s)]
*  I hope you're right. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=208.56s)]
*  I hope we don't see a federal abortion ban under this Trump administration. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=209.56s)]
*  Sorry, not an abortion ban. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=212.12s)]
*  A right to an abortion. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=213.84s)]
*  Sorry, my apologies. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=215.16s)]
*  Oh, sure. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=216.16s)]
*  Sure, yeah. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=217.16s)]
*  I don't think we're going to see that either. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=218.16s)]
*  So I think that where we're really going to see the initiatives and where we're going [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=219.52s)]
*  to see the most impact is at the local level. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=222.7s)]
*  And I've seen that in Texas firsthand. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=225.0s)]
*  We've been fighting so hard in our statehouse and we have been able to pick up some wins, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=227.35999999999999s)]
*  albeit they've been small ones, but they are important. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=232.23999999999998s)]
*  And we know that this is going to be a very long process and we're going to have to fight [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=235.27999999999997s)]
*  tooth and nail for every single crumb. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=238.88s)]
*  And while it's exhausting, I think that's where we're headed. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=241.23999999999998s)]
*  I think we're going to have to look at city council. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=244.11999999999998s)]
*  I think we're going to have to look at our statehouses. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=246.07999999999998s)]
*  And I'm seeing that not just in Texas, but across the country. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=249.11999999999998s)]
*  It's where folks are really plugging in and advocating and having a real impact. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=252.08s)]
*  Well, of course, we're watching the events of there in Washington. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=257.44s)]
*  Amanda Zyrowski, thank you very much for joining us this morning. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=260.76s)]
*  Sam Stein, thank thank thank you as well. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=264.36s)]
*  And Joe, certainly, you know, this is three years since Roe v. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=269.32s)]
*  Wade, still a seminal issue for so many Americans. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=274.56s)]
*  Well, it is. And you know, John, it's interesting. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=279.92s)]
*  So many people look at abortion and say it wasn't wasn't as big an issue as we thought [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=282.12s)]
*  it was going to be in twenty twenty four. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=286.44s)]
*  Well, people are just looking at the presidential campaign. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=288.84000000000003s)]
*  And obviously, that is extraordinarily important. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=291.36s)]
*  But you look at the Democrats winning in Nevada, a Senate seat in Nevada that that [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=294.44s)]
*  many predicted they were going to lose with a very pro-choice candidate there, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=300.44s)]
*  winning the Senate seat in the swing state of Arizona, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=305.72s)]
*  with a very progressive, very pro-choice candidate there. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=309.72s)]
*  The same thing happening in Wisconsin with Tammy Baldwin, the same thing happening, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=314.28000000000003s)]
*  of course, in Michigan. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=320.08s)]
*  So you look at the swing states, a lot of those Senate races, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=321.92s)]
*  the abortion issue made the difference between Democrats holding the seat [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=326.48s)]
*  or picking up new seats or losing the seat. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=330.84000000000003s)]
*  So I know for people who suggest that [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=333.24s)]
*  because Donald Trump won by one and a half percent, that somehow abortion didn't [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=337.71999999999997s)]
*  impact the race in twenty twenty four. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=342.11999999999995s)]
*  I think they're misreading the whole sweep of of of races in the twenty twenty four election. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyI61Ln4mhA&t=344.91999999999996s)]
