# The Trump 'baby bonus': Can WH convince more women to have kids with $5k reward?
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [April 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE)
*  If from the CDC shows the United States birth rate increased just 1% last year. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=0.0s)]
*  The number of American women having children has been trending downward for decades. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=6.12s)]
*  And now the White House is floating ideas for how to change that. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  One proposal includes a $5,000 so-called baby bonus to every mother after delivery. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=13.64s)]
*  Steve Ratner now over at the Southwest Wall with some charts on this. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=20.12s)]
*  All right, so you have more detail, Steve, first of all about the declining birth rates [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=23.72s)]
*  and then we'll get into why this is happening. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=28.24s)]
*  But why don't you start with those first numbers. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=30.08s)]
*  Yeah, I'm also going to get into why the White House is so focused on this because it dovetails [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=32.08s)]
*  with another very interesting issue that's going on. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=37.239999999999995s)]
*  But first let's take a look at what's been happening. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=39.96s)]
*  So birth rates have actually been dropping across the world for a long time and for various [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=42.26s)]
*  different reasons that you can imagine. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=47.12s)]
*  But we'll just focus on the U.S. down here. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=49.0s)]
*  So back in the 1950s, the so-called baby boomer era of which I was one, the birth rate peak [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=52.5s)]
*  did about 3.7 children per family. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=58.28s)]
*  I was born right over here, was a little over three then. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=60.92s)]
*  We had three kids in my family. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=64.36s)]
*  That was pretty typical. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=66.32000000000001s)]
*  But then it's come down, down, down, down, down. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=67.84s)]
*  And now we're sitting down here at 1.6 percent. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=70.4s)]
*  At 1.6 births per mother, sorry about that. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=74.2s)]
*  And Europe, China being even below us. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=78.7s)]
*  Now what are the implications of that? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=80.88s)]
*  The implications of that are actually quite serious, which is what happens to our population. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=82.36s)]
*  1.6 is well below what we call the replacement rate, the number of kids somebody has to, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=86.88000000000001s)]
*  a mother has to have in order simply to keep our population stable, let alone growing. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=91.64s)]
*  And of course keeping our population growing is really important because otherwise you [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  have fewer and fewer working people supporting more and more people who are elderly and that [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=101.84s)]
*  raises all kinds of fiscal and budgetary and cost issues for the economy and for the government. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=106.84s)]
*  So on present course and speed, without any immigration, our population would peak very, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=112.6s)]
*  very soon in the next 10 or so years, around 2038. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=118.52s)]
*  And then it would continue to decline and it will go from 330 million now down to 294 million. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=122.72s)]
*  The difference would, in a normal world, be made up with immigration. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=129.84s)]
*  We allow about this many people to immigrate, roughly about 900,000 people a year is the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=135.28s)]
*  average. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=142.44s)]
*  And so if you assume that the average of 900,000 continues, our population grows slowly to [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=143.68s)]
*  366 million. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=148.84s)]
*  And this is where you get into the whole question of immigration and we know this administration [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=150.72s)]
*  has a different policy on immigration, which is part of why they're talking about things [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=156.35999999999999s)]
*  like these $5,000 credits to try to get parents to have more kids. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=161.88s)]
*  Steve, it's an issue that Elon Musk in particular has been talking about a lot. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=166.6s)]
*  Pro-natalism is a popular movement, especially in some conservative circles. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=170.51999999999998s)]
*  Is that also tied to immigration? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=174.64s)]
*  Yeah, I think this whole narrative out of there, though JD Vance called women what childless [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=176.72s)]
*  cat ladies, the whole narrative out of there about children and so forth is a mix of Elon [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=183.76s)]
*  Musk, as we think, 14 children plus or minus, his belief in more children, but also the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  fact that without that you're going to have to have immigration and this is not an administration [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=195.48s)]
*  dying to have a lot more immigration. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=200.08s)]
*  All right, so let's you got the numbers. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=201.68s)]
*  That's a good backdrop for why this has been happening. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=203.64000000000001s)]
*  What's changed, Steve? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=206.28s)]
*  Well, it's interesting. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=207.28s)]
*  And there are polls and things and everybody on the set's opinion. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=208.28s)]
*  It would be as good as mine on this. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=212.24s)]
*  But here's one poll anyway, with a whole variety of reasons. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=213.96s)]
*  And these don't add up to 100 because people had multiple answers. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=217.44s)]
*  They had several different reasons. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=220.82000000000002s)]
*  Some say they just don't want to. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=222.86s)]
*  of a cultural shift going on out there about having kids and the relevance of a family [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=225.24s)]
*  to one's life. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=231.48000000000002s)]
*  Focus on other things, concerned about the world, can't afford to raise one. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=233.8s)]
*  We're going to come back to this because I think in these sort of more vague answers, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=237.60000000000002s)]
*  I suspect some of this can't afford is embedded up here somewhere. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=240.84s)]
*  Concerns about the environment, right partner, don't like children, 20% don't like children. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=245.56s)]
*  I don't know who those are. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=249.8s)]
*  And then roughly 20% had negative experiences with their own family growing up. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=252.78s)]
*  But the affordability thing is, I think, a big part of this and a big deal. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=257.86s)]
*  So let's take a look at something involving that. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=261.98s)]
*  So if you want to look at housing and healthcare, if you go back to 1984 and you divide the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=265.46s)]
*  country into five sections based on income, so top 20%, next 20% and so forth, let's see [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=271.26s)]
*  what's happened. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=277.14s)]
*  So average home prices have gone up like this, which meant that they have outstripped even [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=278.42s)]
*  people very close to the top. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=284.3s)]
*  Out-of-pocket healthcare also has gone up a lot, but not quite as much as incomes for [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=286.78s)]
*  people very much at the top. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=291.78s)]
*  But everybody else down here, the 80s, 60s, 40s, 20s, all these people below 80 have had [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=293.94s)]
*  to face much higher housing, much higher healthcare costs relative to their incomes. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=300.5s)]
*  And so affordability becomes a real problem for these families. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=306.18s)]
*  Steve, it's so interesting. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=310.02s)]
*  It sort of underscores these reasons on how individual the decision of whether or not [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=312.06s)]
*  to have children is. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=316.3s)]
*  Let's assume people who don't like children are not the target audience for this message. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=318.02s)]
*  But when you look at other people who have either chosen not to have children or have [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=323.34000000000003s)]
*  fewer children than they might have had in the past, to what degree can the government [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=326.94s)]
*  effectively encourage them to have more children through paid family leave or through improving [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=331.74s)]
*  housing prospects? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=337.98s)]
*  To what degree is this within the control of the government to do something about? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=339.26s)]
*  I think there is some control. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=343.42s)]
*  What I would say is that the $5,000 is not going to solve this problem. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=346.42s)]
*  It's a lot of money for some families, but relative to all this other stuff, are they [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=351.06s)]
*  really going to go have kids for $5,000? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=356.14s)]
*  In my own view, the only way to really solve this problem is to attack these kinds of issues. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=358.94s)]
*  We have to make people feel like they have the financial ability to afford a kid, or [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=364.14s)]
*  otherwise they're just going to say, I can't do that. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=368.78s)]
*  And so these are mega challenges that require big changes in government policy, lots of [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=371.78s)]
*  initiatives, not simply $5,000. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=376.7s)]
*  And at the moment, there does not seem to be any real impetus for doing that down in [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=379.7s)]
*  Washington. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=384.42s)]
*  Alright, so Steve, we're proving that you can bring us a chart on just about anything. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=385.90000000000003s)]
*  So separate topic, there have been obviously air tragedies, air disasters. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=389.62s)]
*  We saw an incident the other day where an engine exploded on a Delta flight and people [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=393.86s)]
*  had to jump out the slide and all this. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=399.3s)]
*  But as we're reminded every time we do one of these stories, flying is safer than it's [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=401.1s)]
*  ever been, broadly speaking. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=405.58000000000004s)]
*  What are the numbers there? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=407.34000000000003s)]
*  Well, I'm disappointed Mika's not here because I know that Mika is not that fond of flying, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=408.34000000000003s)]
*  shall we say, and I wanted to show Mika that she's got to deal with the world as it is, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=415.14s)]
*  not as she might imagine it is. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=419.94s)]
*  She's watching, Steve, don't worry, she's watching. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=420.94s)]
*  Yes, Mika, this one's for you. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=422.94s)]
*  So interestingly, contrary to sort of the perception that really started with that terrible [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=424.94s)]
*  Washington crash, flying this year has not been any less safe than in other years. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=430.82s)]
*  So this compares non-fatal accidents against all accidents from 2006 to 2024. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=436.26s)]
*  It includes private planes as well as commercial planes, and that's why this spikes up like [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=447.21999999999997s)]
*  this. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=451.21999999999997s)]
*  A lot of what we call weekend warriors in the flying business come out in the warm weather [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=452.21999999999997s)]
*  months and get themselves in trouble doing stuff they shouldn't do. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=455.46s)]
*  But nonetheless, the pace is no different this year than it's been over this long period [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=459.42s)]
*  of time that I show you here. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=463.62s)]
*  Non-fatal accidents are actually running below their historic rate, and so this year is not [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=466.06s)]
*  aberrational. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=470.86s)]
*  But here's the key point for anyone who's thinking that, worrying at all about flying. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=472.26000000000005s)]
*  So we compare the safety rate of flying versus other modes of transport. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=477.88000000000005s)]
*  Motorcycles, as you would imagine, are pretty dangerous. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=481.86s)]
*  These are injuries per 100 million passenger miles, so still not that many, but motorcycles [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=485.1s)]
*  are tough. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=490.42s)]
*  Buses, cars, trucks. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=491.42s)]
*  But here's air travel down here at .007. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=492.9s)]
*  So what does this mean? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=496.26s)]
*  This means that you are 67 times less likely to get injured flying on a commercial plane [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=497.58s)]
*  than getting on a train. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=505.41999999999996s)]
*  .007, that's right. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=507.58s)]

*  think it was 2008 or 2009. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=524.62s)]
*  So it has been an unbelievably safe mode of transport. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=526.86s)]
*  So to all those of you who take a Valium or worry a lot about getting on a plane, and [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=529.6999999999999s)]
*  for you especially, Mika, .007, that's your chance. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=535.14s)]
*  You can take the Valium if you need to, but just know you're going to get there safely. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=539.22s)]
*  Morning, Joe, economic analyst and pilot, and so much more. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=542.6999999999999s)]

*  Steve, thanks so much. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsNtdSEUCKE&t=548.18s)]
