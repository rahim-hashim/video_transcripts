# 'Trump wants the war to stop': Why the president is eager for quick conclusion
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0)
*  In between that, an extraordinarily important message for Israel, which is, if Benjamin [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=0.0s)]
*  Netanyahu is even thinking about upping the ante here and responding to last night's strikes, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=6.98s)]
*  the so-called spasms of violence that David Ignatius said comes at the end of every war, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=12.46s)]
*  and as you're moving into a ceasefire, Donald Trump letting Netanyahu and Israel know he [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=18.3s)]
*  will be very angry if they get in the way of this ceasefire. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=24.64s)]
*  Yeah, we got the full Trump experience just there. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=28.939999999999998s)]
*  Full Trump. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=31.98s)]
*  Full Trump. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=32.98s)]
*  360. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=33.98s)]
*  Full Trump. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=34.98s)]
*  He is certainly more, his language is much more colorful and private than he usually [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=35.98s)]
*  allows in public. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=39.82s)]
*  We're a little bit there too. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=40.82s)]
*  But you're right, it's interesting. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=43.32s)]
*  Covering Donald Trump for a long time, even in his remarks to reporters there, though [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=45.26s)]
*  angry Iran very clearly far more so at Israel, and then doubling down on that with that truth [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=49.94s)]
*  social post, that's the issue here. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=55.379999999999995s)]
*  We know that he and Benjamin Netanyahu used to be close allies. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=57.62s)]
*  There was a real frame of that in the previous months. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=60.98s)]
*  We know that the president did not go to Israel when he went to the Middle East a month or [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=64.75999999999999s)]
*  so back. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=68.25999999999999s)]
*  It did seem like they was working pretty well with Netanyahu in the last week or so during [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=69.42s)]
*  this campaign against Iran, but President Trump wants the war to stop. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=74.1s)]
*  He didn't want it to begin in the first place. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=78.25999999999999s)]
*  He went along with it. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=80.24s)]
*  He did help certainly with that strike at the facilities on Saturday, but now he's eager [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=81.5s)]
*  for it to come to a quick conclusion and he's furious that at least for now it hasn't just [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=86.7s)]
*  yet. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=91.46s)]
*  So joining this conversation, we have editor in chief of The Economist, Zani Mintz-Inbedos, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=92.46s)]
*  vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Corey Hinderstein. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=96.78s)]
*  She's credited with locating the denounced nuclear site in Iran back in 2002, as well [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=102.66s)]
*  as editor at The Insider, Michael Weiss. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=107.74s)]
*  So Joe, we've got a great group here to help us sift through the latest out of the Middle [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=110.46s)]
*  East, including the president's really remarkable anger directed at Israel. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=116.58s)]
*  There's a lot of incoming. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=121.41999999999999s)]
*  You can talk about, again, his media critique. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=122.86s)]
*  You can talk about the F-bomb. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=126.05999999999999s)]
*  I think we're going to focus on Michael Weiss instead on just a direct challenge of Benjamin [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=127.66s)]
*  Netanyahu and Israel saying, whatever happened last night, this is the morning. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=132.42s)]
*  I do not expect Israel to launch further attacks into Iran. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=138.62s)]
*  What can you tell us about where the situation is right now and what we can expect? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=144.5s)]
*  Well, I think, first off, Donald Trump is in a very triumphalist mode. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=148.18s)]
*  He was absolutely glorifying in the U.S. military operation to drop the massive ordnance penetrators [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=153.48s)]
*  on Fordow, praising the pilots of the B-2 bombers, the B-2s themselves, talking about [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=162.54s)]
*  how great and shiny the American military is and it can't be beat. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=168.9s)]
*  But then, as Jonathan and you have pointed out, he wanted to wrap this thing up. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=172.73999999999998s)]
*  So he backed Israel and took a lot of flak from his own coalition in MAGA world, using [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=177.5s)]
*  Steve Bannon, according to the New York Times, basically as a PsyOP to pretend like he wasn't [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=183.54s)]
*  about to engage in the strike. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=187.76s)]
*  He wants to basically put the pieces back together of his MAGA coalition and bring the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=189.8s)]
*  isolationists back on board. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=195.32000000000002s)]
*  So this ceasefire, which, as you note, is very tenuous to begin with, there was another [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=197.28s)]
*  rocket attack after the one that killed as many as four Israelis, which the Iranians [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=202.24s)]
*  claim that they launched prior to their commitment to the ceasefire. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=207.72000000000003s)]
*  And that rocket attack, which I think there were two missiles, both intercepted by the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=210.72000000000003s)]
*  Israelis, is what the Israelis said that they're going to respond to. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=214.92000000000002s)]
*  The defense minister said something like, we will respond very forcefully in central [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=217.8s)]
*  Tehran and highlighted that it was going to be the same kind of targets that Israel hit [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=222.0s)]
*  the other day, the Basij paramilitary headquarters and other security installations. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=226.60000000000002s)]
*  So no doubt they'd be aiming for other IRGC officials. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=231.0s)]
*  And I think what you're seeing here is Donald Trump telling him, don't even think about [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=234.4s)]
*  it. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=237.44s)]
*  His war is over. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=238.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=239.44s)]
*  And Zani, it is difficult to imagine either Iran at this point or Israel deciding to cross [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=240.44s)]
*  an angry Donald Trump. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=249.16s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu had said before our strike in Iran that Israel can go this alone. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=250.72s)]
*  I'm not so sure that many people in Israel believe that without the U.S. support. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=257.15999999999997s)]
*  What do you think happens next? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=262.56s)]
*  First of all, let's get your reaction. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=263.96s)]
*  First of all, not only to the extraordinary press avail in front of the White House at [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=267.32s)]
*  Marine One, but also put it up again, guys, and let's keep it up. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=272.71999999999997s)]
*  This tweet that the president made earlier this morning, just warning Israel, don't even [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=278.24s)]
*  think about responding to Iran. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=286.15999999999997s)]
*  So I think it's really welcome that he's done that. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=289.92s)]
*  I mean, perhaps not with the F word, but it is very, very clear that he's that clear to [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=292.24s)]
*  I think, actually, as David Ignatius said earlier in your show, this probably was the [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=298.0s)]
*  sort of final spasms of a 12-day war. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=303.28000000000003s)]
*  Often Middle East ceasefires have people trying to get one last bomb in. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=305.72s)]
*  But this very clear message from the president of the United States to Israel, do not do [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=309.40000000000003s)]
*  anymore, I think is not just good for the short term in that it means that this is likely [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=313.6s)]
*  to hold. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=317.48s)]
*  But I think if the president continues this overt pressure on Bibi Netanyahu, we are [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=318.48s)]
*  much more likely to get from this the longstanding diplomatic agreement that we need with Iran [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=322.68s)]
*  and, frankly, a more optimistic potential for a bigger deal in the Middle East. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=329.24s)]
*  The thing that President Trump has had to do is stand up to Bibi Netanyahu in public [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=334.8s)]
*  and say no more. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=339.92s)]
*  And I think if he starts saying no more a bit more often, the Middle East will be in [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=340.92s)]
*  a very good place. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=343.76s)]
*  Well, and Susan Page, obviously the president exerting pressure on Israel and Iran to move [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=345.8s)]
*  past again, as David Ignatius said, these spasms of violence that come at the end of [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=353.32s)]
*  most wars. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=358.56s)]
*  And as Annie said, the president exerting that pressure most likely will do more than [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=360.44s)]
*  not to help uphold the ceasefire. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=366.36s)]
*  So what's next? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=370.0s)]
*  So President Trump has enormous clout at the moment, both with Iran because of the United [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=371.48s)]
*  States joining the Israeli assault there with the bombing, also with Israel for undertaking [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=376.28000000000003s)]
*  this step that Benjamin Netanyahu had long sought the United States to take, other presidents [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=382.56s)]
*  unwilling to take it to drop those big bombs. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=387.76s)]
*  So he comes to this table with a lot of cards to play, not only with Israel and Iran, but [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=391.76s)]
*  on his way to NATO. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=397.6s)]
*  There are repercussions, I think, from what so far, I mean, you know, ceasefires are shaky, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=399.76s)]
*  we understand that, but what so far is a pretty good situation. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=406.2s)]
*  There are repercussions for Trump's power in other situations around the world, and [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=409.68s)]
*  I wonder if we're going to see some of that in the meeting he's heading to now with NATO. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=415.96s)]
*  Well, and Jonathan, we already are seeing that. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=420.92s)]
*  There is no doubt that Donald Trump throws sharp elbows, that he moves across the landscape [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=425.0s)]
*  on the world stage in a way of breaking stuff in a way that other presidents have not done. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=432.6s)]
*  But let's just take these two situations right now. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=439.56s)]
*  As Zanny said, him weighing in and him applying pressure to both Israel and Iran not to strike [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=443.56s)]
*  it more likely, I'm not saying that Israel's not going to strike, but make it more likely [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=451.92s)]
*  that this ceasefire holds. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=457.04s)]
*  And also, he's going right now to the Hague, and it was Donald Trump talking about 2 percent [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=460.36s)]
*  of NATO members' GDP being applied to military spending, that they needed to do that. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=466.92s)]
*  He was talking about that in the first term as we see Air Force One about to take off [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=474.52000000000004s)]
*  from Joint Base Andrews to go to the Netherlands for the NATO meeting. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=479.59999999999997s)]
*  But now we have European countries, we have NATO talking about 5 percent contributions [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=484.0s)]
*  of their GDP. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=490.12s)]
*  Yes, certainly a remarkable achievement there. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=491.12s)]
*  President Trump and his allies say to get NATO countries, most of them anyway, to agree [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=495.2s)]
*  to do up to 5 percent. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=499.15999999999997s)]
*  We're watching here as Air Force One soon to lift off. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=501.88s)]
*  We of course will be keeping an eye on whether President posts more on social media while [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=504.52s)]
*  in flight or if he comes back to talk to reporters as he so often does for the latest on the [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=509.71999999999997s)]
*  situation in the Middle East. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=515.84s)]
*  Corey, let's go to you now and talk about, as best you can, because this is your area [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=517.4s)]
*  of expertise, the Iran program that the United States hit Saturday night. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=523.04s)]
*  Tell us more about your instrumental in discovering pieces of it. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=528.52s)]
*  Tell us what you know as to what Iran had achieved. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=533.4s)]
*  And again, it's difficult. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=537.32s)]
*  The Pentagon itself has said they're still doing their damage assessment. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=539.0s)]
*  But what you think may have, what sort of blows may have been dealt to it in the last [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=542.76s)]
*  few days? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=547.5600000000001s)]
*  I think it's really interesting to look at how the conversation around Iran's nuclear [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=549.4s)]
*  capability has changed over the last few days. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=553.52s)]
*  What we've seen is a very clear, very targeted attack on some of the key facilities in Iran. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=556.36s)]
*  And those facilities were those that were prepared to take Iran up to the line of being [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=564.72s)]
*  capable of making a nuclear weapon. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=571.28s)]
*  So it's not just the uranium enrichment sites that we've heard so much about, but one of [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=573.52s)]
*  the early targets by Israel was a facility to turn that enriched uranium into metal, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=578.52s)]
*  which would be a key step on the progress towards a nuclear weapon capability. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=585.5200000000001s)]
*  So Iran had a lot of the pieces in place. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=590.8800000000001s)]
*  They did not have all the pieces in place. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=593.96s)]
*  So this was not an imminent nuclear weapons threat, but the nuclear weapons capability [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=596.3800000000001s)]
*  was walking right up to those lines. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=601.36s)]
*  And we've seen that be significantly degraded. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=604.0s)]
*  The key question is how degraded and for how long will that degradation last? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=606.6s)]
*  So if they were able to move not just the enriched uranium, but key pieces of manufacturing [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=612.48s)]
*  equipment and some of those other elements, then they may be able to reconstitute more quickly. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=617.36s)]
*  Suzanni, that is the great fear is we don't know what material still exists and how Iran [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=623.48s)]
*  may use it. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=630.72s)]
*  So talk to us about this moment here and just how challenging it is for the President of [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=632.52s)]
*  the United States, and we've heard him weigh in colorfully this morning, but as he heads [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=637.48s)]
*  to Europe and meets with allies, how is the rest of the world viewing this situation in [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=640.8399999999999s)]
*  the Middle East? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=644.5999999999999s)]
*  So I think the rest of the world was viewing it with quite a lot of trepidation. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=645.5999999999999s)]
*  But right now, you know, nothing breeds success like success. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=648.7199999999999s)]
*  And I think the fact that this looks like it's been a triumphant success, what the U.S., [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=652.04s)]
*  what President Trump has done in 12 days, Israel and then with President Trump's help [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=656.9599999999999s)]
*  has dramatically reduced Iran's nuclear capability to a degree that few before thought was possible. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=662.04s)]
*  No one expected that the U.S. would come in as it did and with relatively few consequences. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=668.68s)]
*  So the question is what happens now? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=673.3199999999999s)]
*  And I think the risk is that if President Trump does not stay engaged and put pressure [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=675.3199999999999s)]
*  on both sides, particularly on Israel, there is a risk that basically Iran makes a dash [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=680.16s)]
*  for a bomb. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=684.56s)]
*  We don't know how much material they have left. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=685.56s)]
*  We don't know if they'll try and leave the nonproliferation treaty and do it in secret. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=688.2399999999999s)]
*  That would be a very bad outcome. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=692.12s)]
*  But if he reaches out and turns now to diplomacy, gets some kind of deal with Iran, which for [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=693.12s)]
*  me frankly is in a very weak place and doesn't have much room, and then pushes Israel, and [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=698.66s)]
*  this I think is really important, if he now uses this leverage to push Israel to end the [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=703.26s)]
*  war in Gaza too soon, then I think you have the potential. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=707.64s)]
*  And I know David Ignatius said, you know, pessimism always pays in the Middle East. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=711.42s)]
*  But this may be a moment where actually we could be doing, having a turning point so [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=714.74s)]
*  that 2025 and President Trump becomes like, you know, a pivotal moment in the troubled [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=719.56s)]
*  history of the Middle East. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=725.4s)]
*  I don't want to sound Pollyanna-ish, but I do think that possibility now exists and President [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=726.48s)]
*  Trump is the one person who can make that happen. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RLuwEo9D0&t=730.4s)]
