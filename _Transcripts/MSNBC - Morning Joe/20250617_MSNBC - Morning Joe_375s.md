# Richard Engel: Iranians promised a night of fire and brimstone and it didn't really happen
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k)
*  Joining us now live from Israel is NBC News Chief Foreign Correspondent Richard Angle. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=0.0s)]
*  Richard, good to see you. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=5.24s)]
*  Obviously, at the G7 last night, you talked about what's happening there in Israel first [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=6.24s)]
*  and foremost. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=11.68s)]
*  The president flew all night. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  Doesn't look like he got any sleep on Air Force One. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=14.6s)]
*  He is just back in the White House. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=16.68s)]
*  He's gathering security officials this morning to talk about the situation. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=17.88s)]
*  Give us an update from the ground there. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=22.32s)]
*  So last night was a little bit quieter than it has been in recent days. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=27.36s)]
*  The Iranians had been promising a night of fire and brimstone. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=32.48s)]
*  They said that Iran was preparing the most intense bombardment by missiles against Israel [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=36.0s)]
*  that this country has ever seen. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=41.4s)]
*  And it didn't really happen. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=43.72s)]
*  There were a few explosions. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  There were a few missiles that were fired at this country, some at Haifa, some in the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  Tel Aviv area. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=51.0s)]
*  This is where one of them managed to get through the Israeli security net, through the air [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=52.78s)]
*  defenses. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=58.22s)]
*  And I can show you what it did. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=59.22s)]
*  When we talk about these ballistic missiles, they are extraordinarily powerful. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=61.58s)]
*  This is the crater that one of them caused just a few hours ago. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=65.22s)]
*  I heard the explosion. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=70.46000000000001s)]
*  It's probably 15 to 20 feet deep. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=71.7s)]
*  And it didn't cause any deaths, didn't cause any injuries here, but it did cause some damage, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=75.16s)]
*  mostly to this bus depot. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=81.7s)]
*  It charred all of these buses. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=84.46000000000001s)]
*  And luckily, nobody appears to have been here at the time. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=87.26s)]
*  Nobody was on these buses. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=90.74000000000001s)]
*  It was more or less a parking lot. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=92.34s)]
*  But had it hit an apartment building, as it did yesterday, also not very far from here, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=95.10000000000001s)]
*  a very different situation. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=99.74000000000001s)]
*  So Israelis are on edge. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=101.30000000000001s)]
*  The Israelis do feel that they have the upper hand. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=104.46000000000001s)]
*  They have the upper hand militarily, as you've been talking about. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=107.64s)]
*  The Israeli Air Force says it now has complete freedom of operation over Tehran. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=111.02s)]
*  But the Iranians are still firing some missiles at Israel, but last night on a relatively [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=117.86s)]
*  small scale, not this massive attack that they had been threatening. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=123.97999999999999s)]
*  And one thing, Joe, you mentioned earlier about the concern that these early military [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=128.66s)]
*  successes that Israel is having, will it give it a false sense of security? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=135.98s)]
*  Will it lead to more action? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=140.42s)]
*  Is there a 2002 dynamic here? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=143.18s)]
*  And that is exactly what many senior officials across the Middle East who I'm speaking to [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=145.92s)]
*  are worried about. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=151.22s)]
*  They're telling me that this all feels like 2002 all over again, that there's discussion [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=152.6s)]
*  of redrawing the map of the Middle East, changing the mentality of the Middle East, regime change [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=158.3s)]
*  in the Middle East, allegations of weapons of mass destruction imminently being ready [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=163.57999999999998s)]
*  and imminently going to be used in a variety of locations. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=169.18s)]
*  And not here necessarily in Israel, but across the Arab world. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=172.94s)]
*  I'm hearing this on a daily basis. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=176.98000000000002s)]
*  People are worried. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=180.22s)]
*  Are we back in 2002? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=181.22s)]
*  Are we back in 2003 all over again? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=182.70000000000002s)]
*  Richard, this is David Ignatius in Washington. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=185.9s)]
*  Just curious what you're hearing from Israeli officials and the people that you're talking [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=189.22s)]
*  to about this question you were just discussing. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=193.70000000000002s)]
*  How does this end? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=197.0s)]
*  Do Israelis see this conflict going on until effectively there's an Iranian surrender? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=198.16s)]
*  Would they be disappointed if President Trump moved into a serious negotiation with the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=204.28s)]
*  Iranians for some kind of new deal? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=210.1s)]
*  As you know, the Israelis are very divided on this subject. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=213.4s)]
*  They're very divided on Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=218.88s)]
*  I was speaking yesterday with a young Israeli woman who was more or less echoing the government [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=221.56s)]
*  line and it's the line you hear from government officials. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=226.95999999999998s)]
*  It's the one you see very often on state TV that Israel has no choice, that if it didn't [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=229.95999999999998s)]
*  do this action and if it didn't take advantage of this moment when Iran is weak, when its [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=235.56s)]
*  proxies around the region have been defanged, that one day it would be facing Iran with [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=241.11999999999998s)]
*  a nuclear weapon and the logic being better now than later. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=246.48s)]
*  So there is a significant portion of Israeli society that believes that. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=251.73999999999998s)]
*  People on the street believe that and that is the government's line. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=256.72s)]
*  But there are others who don't trust Netanyahu, who don't trust his intentions, who worry [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=260.52s)]
*  that he's acting for his own political motivations and they see scenes like this every day and [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=264.92s)]
*  they say enough is enough. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=270.64s)]
*  We're fighting in Gaza, they're fighting in Lebanon, they're fighting still or occupying [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=272.28000000000003s)]
*  parts of Syria in the Golan Heights and now in an open war with Iran with no apparent [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=277.92s)]
*  end in sight. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=284.44s)]
*  And the war in Gaza is often getting overshadowed by all of this. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=286.48s)]
*  It is continuing at a ferocious pace. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=290.68s)]
*  According to medical officials, just today more than 50 people were killed while they [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=292.92s)]
*  were trying to gather food. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=299.36s)]
*  A medical official told NBC News that they were hit by drones and artillery as Palestinians [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=300.96000000000004s)]
*  were waiting to collect basic supplies, food primarily, and that hospitals in the area, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=306.36s)]
*  because of this latest attack that is describing as a massacre, that the hospitals are overwhelmed. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=312.4s)]
*  So this country is at war on multiple fronts. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=319.23999999999995s)]
*  It is facing protests, it is facing international backlash. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=322.64s)]
*  Some airlines no longer fly to Israel, not just because the airspaces are closed right [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=326.0s)]
*  now, but for political reasons. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=330.03999999999996s)]
*  So there is a segment of the society that would like to wrap this up and see an exit [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=332.03999999999996s)]
*  strategy. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=338.23999999999995s)]
*  It is unclear to say which is in the majority, but the government is certainly saying that [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=339.24s)]
*  this is not a war of choice, but a war of necessity. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=345.48s)]
*  NBC News, Foreign correspondent Richard Engel, thank you very much for your reporting this morning. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2FXwAs86k&t=348.08s)]
