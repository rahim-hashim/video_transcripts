# 'Disinformation' from the top down is being used against judges, says Judge Salas
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI)
*  We should be concerned in this country about, as I've already indicated, the tone of our political discourse. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=0.0s)]
*  Identity politics are used so that a person is characterized by his or her partisan affiliation. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=12.0s)]
*  That's not what democracy and civil discourse is about. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=23.0s)]
*  What democracy and civil discourse are about are taking issues and discussing them. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=28.0s)]
*  And this is what judges do, and this is why judges are of central importance. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=33.0s)]
*  That was a rare public appearance yesterday by retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy speaking virtually at the nonpartisan Speak Up for Justice Forum. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=38.0s)]
*  He called for more stability amid the current hostility in American politics as a growing number of judges across the nation reported increase in threats against them. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=49.0s)]
*  Joining us now is another judge who participated in yesterday's forum, U.S. District Judge for the District of New Jersey, Esther Salas. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=60.0s)]
*  In July of 2020, her son Daniel was fatally shot by a disgruntled attorney posing as a delivery worker at her home while the family was celebrating Daniel's 20th birthday. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=68.0s)]
*  Her husband Mark was also shot but survived. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=79.0s)]
*  She has become a vocal advocate for increased security for judges and their families, leading to the passage of Daniel's law, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=82.0s)]
*  which aims to protect federal judges by safeguarding their personally identifiable information and that of their close relatives. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=90.0s)]
*  Thank you so much, Judge, for being here this morning. You, of course, have our condolences. I know the five year anniversary is on the horizon. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=100.0s)]
*  Let's speak to this current moment. The rhetoric is so heated and there's there have been violent incidents towards public officials. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=107.0s)]
*  There's been a real rise in threats against public officials, including judges. What do you see? How worried are you? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=116.0s)]
*  I'm worried. I'm worried. And I think that everybody that's watching needs to watch yesterday's show, Speak Up for Justice.Law. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=123.0s)]
*  Everyone should hear from Justice Kennedy. But there were panelists on that show, on our show that spoke to the real dangers. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=134.0s)]
*  A judge from Poland, a judge from Venezuela, a justice, Justice Goldstone from South Africa. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=143.0s)]
*  And they speak to what is really what we're really talking about here today. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=150.0s)]
*  And no one said it better than the chief justice in his year end report when he talked about the illegitimate attacks against the judiciary. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=157.0s)]
*  Four of them violence. I'm living proof of that. Right. My poor son, my baby, the light of my life and my husband Mark's life to intimidation. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=165.0s)]
*  You've covered this story, but we're seeing pizza doxing. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=176.0s)]
*  Over one hundred and three pizzas have been delivered to judges all across the United States of America. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=181.0s)]
*  And those pizzas are sent to send messages. We know where you live. We know where your kids live. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=187.0s)]
*  And now 20 of them have been sent in my Daniel's name. And that says you want to end up like Daniel, you want to end up like Judge Salas. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=193.0s)]
*  That's the intimidation the justice was talking about. But now let's talk about disinformation. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=203.0s)]
*  Jonathan, disinformation is being used. They used it in Poland to tell the public that the judges were corrupt. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=209.0s)]
*  They used it in Venezuela and it started from the top down telling the public that the judges were corrupt. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=217.0s)]
*  And now we see disinformation being used from the top down here in the United States. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=223.0s)]
*  Judges are monsters. We hate America. Judges are deranged, crazy leftist unconstitutional judges. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=229.0s)]
*  That's the type of rhetoric that is being used to spin a narrative that the justice system isn't working here. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=237.0s)]
*  And that's not true. And you know, the justice said it great yesterday. Say no to tyranny. Say yes to truth. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=246.0s)]
*  The truth is the justice system works. It's the best one, I believe, anywhere in the world. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=254.0s)]
*  And that is what we need to do, Molly. That is what we need to do is speak truth. The justice system works. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=260.0s)]
*  We have a system. If the government doesn't like our rulings, our orders, then by all means, appeal us to a higher court. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=268.0s)]
*  Appeal us to a higher court and allow that court to render. It is not the answer to threaten impeachment. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=276.0s)]
*  It is not the answer to sue us. It is not the answer to denigrate the entire justice system because you don't like a ruling. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=282.0s)]
*  And that's why I'm speaking up for justice. That's why. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=291.0s)]
*  Judge Salas, you have been through so much. I mean, just so much. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=295.0s)]
*  And I wonder how you get the strength to come out here and talk to us. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=300.0s)]
*  Listen, I lost my only child, my only child. Mark and I lost the love, the light of our lives. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=304.0s)]
*  But we're in danger. As the justice said yesterday, freedom can die. Democracy can die. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=310.0s)]
*  And that's why for me, I love my son and I love this country. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=317.0s)]
*  Listen, threats are up. The budget is down. The judiciary has been operating on a flat budget for two years and a lot of things are paying the price. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=322.0s)]
*  And so at this time, we need our third pillar of this government, our third branch to be supported by Congress. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=332.0s)]
*  We need them to fund the judiciary so we can continue to uphold the democracy that this country has thrived on. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=341.0s)]
*  Justice can die. Freedom can die. And that's why I'm here. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=350.0s)]
*  That's why Mark has blessed me to come forward and start talking. This is painful for us. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=355.0s)]
*  Oh, I'm sure. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=360.0s)]
*  You know, we're on our, you know, we're coming up on the fifth anniversary. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=361.0s)]
*  I just want people to understand that we need to tone down the rhetoric. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=365.0s)]
*  And by the way, it goes both sides. You know, when we call a judge, a Republican judge, a Democrat judge, a MAGA Supreme Court, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=370.0s)]
*  when you call us monsters and deranged and rogues and out of control, those words are inciting people to do us harm. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=378.0s)]
*  In our final like 30 seconds or so, what is the danger of particularly public officials with big platforms attacking judges? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=387.0s)]
*  Oh my gosh. It almost gives green light. It almost, you know, there's a representative in Congress that has a wanted poster outside his chamber, outside his room. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=393.0s)]
*  He is what do we say? Wanted means wanted dead or alive. What does wanted mean? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=404.0s)]
*  We have to start being responsible. We have to ask our political leaders to lead responsibly. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=409.0s)]
*  That is what we need to do in this country. Let's get back to kindness. Let's get back to agreeing to disagree. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=415.0s)]
*  Let's get back to civil discourse like the justice noted. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=421.0s)]
*  Very, very important message there. I know a deeply personal one. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=425.0s)]
*  U.S. District Judge for the District of New Jersey, Esther Salas. Thank you so much for joining us this morning. We really appreciate it. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=429.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdsvRGefOiI&t=459.0s)]
