# Biden warned Harris not to criticize him during 2024 campaign, book suggests
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [July 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk)
*  Which something differently than President Biden during the past four years? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=0.0s)]
*  There is not a thing that comes to mind in terms of, and I've been a part of most of [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=6.2s)]
*  the decisions that have had impact. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=11.68s)]
*  That moment on the view just a few weeks before the 2024 presidential election highlighted [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=14.96s)]
*  the struggle by Kamala Harris to either stay loyal to Joe Biden or to distance herself [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=19.72s)]
*  from him. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=24.32s)]
*  That may have contributed to her loss in November. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=25.32s)]
*  And now, new reporting shows Biden warned her not to criticize him as she carved out [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=27.5s)]
*  her own campaign against Donald Trump. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=32.66s)]
*  That is one of the bits of reporting from the new book, 2024, How Trump Retook the White [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=34.74s)]
*  House and the Democrats Lost America. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=39.42s)]
*  Joining us now, the book's co-authors, Wall Street Journal political investigative reporter [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=41.9s)]
*  Josh Dawsey, New York Times White House correspondent Tyler Pager, and Washington Post White House [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=46.22s)]
*  correspondent Isaac Arnstorf. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=51.34s)]
*  A murderer's row of White House correspondents. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=53.620000000000005s)]
*  Guys, good morning. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=55.66s)]
*  Congratulations on the book. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=56.66s)]
*  Just out today. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=58.059999999999995s)]
*  Tyler, let me start with you and ask about that moment because you guys have reporting [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=59.059999999999995s)]
*  the book where Joe Biden, when letting Kamala Harris know he's dipping out of the race saying, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=64.3s)]
*  you shouldn't run away from me entirely, though some people are probably going to tell you [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=69.46s)]
*  to do that. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=73.5s)]
*  I am popular in places like Pennsylvania, which you're going to need to win. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=74.5s)]
*  Yeah, what's remarkable about that moment, Willie, is that that call happens on the day [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=78.06s)]
*  of her debate with Donald Trump, which is in Philadelphia. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=82.1s)]
*  And Biden is calling ostensibly to wish her good luck on one of the most consequential [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=86.42s)]
*  nights of her professional life. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=90.7s)]
*  And then he says he's hearing from friends that she may be campaigning in a way that [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=93.1s)]
*  is disloyal to him. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=97.3s)]
*  And he suggests that could be a political mistake because he remains popular in Pennsylvania. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=99.66s)]
*  But remember, at this time, Joe Biden has basically been pushed off the ticket and Democrats [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=104.86s)]
*  do not want him running. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=109.66s)]
*  And many actually want her to separate herself from him. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=111.28s)]
*  That's not the only reason she didn't separate herself from him. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=114.1s)]
*  But that's a key moment in this campaign in which she's really trying to run her own race [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=116.69999999999999s)]
*  against Donald Trump. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=121.74s)]
*  So, Josh, you guys write a lot about this in the book, which is the relationship between [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=122.74s)]
*  President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris down the stretch there. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=126.82s)]
*  What was it like personally between them and between their two very separate camps of advisors? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=130.22s)]
*  Well, they had very different camps of advisors, but a lot of them stayed, actually, as we [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=135.42s)]
*  reported in the book. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=139.82s)]
*  The key campaign leadership stayed. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=140.82s)]
*  I think while they had a warm and friendly relationship, as the way Tyler was saying, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=143.9s)]
*  a lot of the folks around Kamala Harris wanted her to make some distance from Biden on various [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=147.62s)]
*  places. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=154.06s)]
*  They said, you know, he's an albatross, his numbers are so bad, the public really does [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=155.06s)]
*  not want him as president. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=158.62s)]
*  And to have a chance at winning this race, we have to have some distance. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=160.94s)]
*  And she was not willing to do that. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=165.70000000000002s)]
*  I mean, as you showed the famous clip there on The View, she gives that answer. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=167.38s)]
*  And our book reports her aides backstage, head in their hands. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=172.45999999999998s)]
*  They try to get the host to actually do the question again to hopefully revise her answer, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=175.5s)]
*  which she never does. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=181.7s)]
*  So what her team is contending with throughout the fall is, you know, his numbers, his problems. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=182.94s)]
*  And she doesn't want to create any public distance. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=191.17999999999998s)]
*  She thinks it won't be authentic. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=193.7s)]
*  She believes that it wouldn't work. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=195.85999999999999s)]
*  And her team is trying to get her to do that. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=197.85999999999999s)]
*  Even though he's not on the ticket, he's sort of looming large in the background of the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=199.82000000000002s)]
*  whole campaign. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=203.10000000000002s)]
*  And Isaac, fascinating to hear the other side of this dynamic from Donald Trump that you [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=204.82000000000002s)]
*  guys write about as well, which is he felt like he had defeated Joe Biden by the time [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=208.38000000000002s)]
*  that debate disaster happened. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=213.82000000000002s)]
*  He certainly thought the race was over. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=215.38000000000002s)]
*  And now he's got somebody new to run against. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=217.74s)]
*  What were his initial struggles to do that? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=220.22000000000003s)]
*  Well, there's a month there where he really couldn't deal with it. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=222.3s)]
*  I mean, he kind of goes off the rails and almost blows up his whole campaign, which [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=225.26s)]
*  had been running very successfully up until that point, because he took it out on his [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=229.46s)]
*  advisors who told him to do that debate, told them that he could beat Biden and he wasn't [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=233.38s)]
*  going to go anywhere. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=237.74s)]
*  And then he felt betrayed when actually they did yank Biden and put him up against Harris, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=238.78s)]
*  who was someone by his own account he couldn't respect. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=243.78s)]
*  And he didn't feel like he didn't respect how she got there. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=246.98s)]
*  He didn't respect her personally. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=249.1s)]
*  And he didn't feel like he could run against someone he didn't respect. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=251.02s)]
*  He couldn't get his head in that game. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=254.06s)]
*  And that was really the lowest point of the campaign for him. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=256.86s)]
*  So, Josh, Donald Trump, I think it's fair to say, scored one of the biggest political [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=261.26s)]
*  upsets in American political history in 2016. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=269.78000000000003s)]
*  And after January the 6th, several court cases, felony indictments and convictions, 2024 [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=275.18s)]
*  were also one of the great upsets. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=284.02s)]
*  I want to read something that you all wrote about the Carter funeral. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=287.62s)]
*  I think it's fascinating. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=294.62s)]
*  A day earlier, he had attended Jimmy Carter's funeral. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=295.62s)]
*  Walking into Washington, not as a scourge, but as a conqueror, he could ignore the speech [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=298.62s)]
*  on character by the outgoing president and the cold shoulder from the vice president [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=303.82s)]
*  he had defeated. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=308.09999999999997s)]
*  Instead, he sat next to Barack Obama and invited him to play golf, enticing him with [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=309.09999999999997s)]
*  descriptions of Trump courses around the world. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=313.42s)]
*  He was no longer an anomaly. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=315.90000000000003s)]
*  He was being treated like an American president. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=318.5s)]
*  He wanted to be remembered as a great one. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=321.5s)]
*  Josh, in your reporting, how did Donald Trump do it? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=324.54s)]
*  How do you do it in 16? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=329.82s)]
*  Shock the political world? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=331.5s)]
*  How did he do it in 2024? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=332.86s)]
*  And once again, shock the political world, shock official Washington and the media. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=335.82s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=342.02000000000004s)]
*  Well, one of it came to Suzy Wiles, his campaign manager. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=343.02000000000004s)]
*  She came in the beginning of 2021 when he's sort of a pariah. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=347.82000000000005s)]
*  He's down in Florida. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=352.5s)]
*  His friends have basically left him. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=354.36s)]
*  He's not there running the Republican Party at that point, the way he is now, and his [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=355.78000000000003s)]
*  power diminished. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=359.94000000000005s)]
*  And Suzy kind of helped to put together a team of people to bring his comeback. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=361.46000000000004s)]
*  And it wasn't always fait accompli, right? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=366.96000000000004s)]
*  The launch in 2022, as we reported in the book, they can't even get members of Congress [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=369.5s)]
*  to come to Mar-a-Lago for the club. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=374.58000000000004s)]
*  They're like using the guy who has like the brick suit as like a B-level Trump celebrity [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=376.74s)]
*  as like on the front row because they're not getting anyone else, right? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=381.26s)]
*  And the convictions really in 2023, 2024, the charges of him in the trial coalesced [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=385.74s)]
*  the Republican Party back around Trump. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=394.22s)]
*  I mean, one of the things we have in the book is when I interviewed him in Mar-a-Lago, he [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=396.26s)]
*  said even he was surprised at how quickly the Republicans rallied to his events in that [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=400.5s)]
*  case, right? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=404.90000000000003s)]
*  I mean, he gets charged in New York. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=405.90000000000003s)]
*  He gets all of these felony charges. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=407.66s)]
*  He ends up, you know, getting convicted. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=409.74s)]
*  They're appealing good now. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=411.3s)]
*  But what does the Republican Party do that immediately brings them, you know, around [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=412.78000000000003s)]
*  him? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=418.38s)]
*  And it really created problems for all of the other Republicans. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=419.38s)]
*  The DeSantis people joked, you know, maybe we need to get them arrested to get some attention. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=422.58000000000004s)]
*  They couldn't get any on air. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=426.70000000000005s)]
*  The base was turning back towards Trump. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=428.90000000000003s)]
*  And then if you look at how he did it in the general election, I mean, his instincts down [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=431.78000000000003s)]
*  the stretch, how they decided to cut ads for early voting, even though Trump had said the [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=435.86s)]
*  election falsely was stolen, you know, for so long. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=442.02000000000004s)]
*  Let's actually do early voting. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=444.82000000000005s)]
*  Let's do mail-in voting. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=446.14000000000004s)]
*  How he handled abortion, while they talked about the economy, how they talked about cultural [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=447.46000000000004s)]
*  issues. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=450.78000000000003s)]
*  And what their reporting in the book shows is that they just had a better sense of where [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=451.82s)]
*  the public was. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=455.58s)]
*  And Trump was willing to make some pretty shrewd, critics might say, cynical decisions [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=456.85999999999996s)]
*  to win. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=461.73999999999995s)]
*  And Tyler, talk about, you guys report that the search of Morillago really was the rocket [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=462.73999999999995s)]
*  fuel for this whole campaign. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=470.38s)]
*  Talk about that. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=472.38s)]
*  Yeah, that's where we start this book, because I think what's important is to understand, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=473.38s)]
*  as Josh was just outlining, this two-year process by which Trump comes back from a pariah [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=478.38s)]
*  status in the Republican Party. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=485.98s)]
*  So if you look at that search, he's actually, there's a dramatic scene in the book where [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=487.9s)]
*  he's meeting with his lawyers to prepare for a different legal issue in New York. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=492.82s)]
*  And he gets a call that there's been this search by the FBI at his private residence [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=497.62s)]
*  at Morillago. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=502.14s)]
*  And that really sets him off and begins this sort of campaign where he says not only he [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=503.74s)]
*  is the victim, but all of his supporters are the victims too. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=510.21999999999997s)]
*  And so he ties his own personal fate to the stakes of the election. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=513.86s)]
*  And he says he's not just running for his freedom, but he's running for his supporters [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=518.1s)]
*  too. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=522.38s)]
*  And sort of combining those two things is part and parcel to what was at the base of [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=523.38s)]
*  his campaign and really convinces him to run. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=528.1s)]
*  We have some really interesting reporting from people like Senator Lindsey Graham, who [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=531.02s)]
*  say when he was playing golf with Trump in 2022, he wasn't fully sold, that Trump was [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=534.38s)]
*  going to run again. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=539.9399999999999s)]
*  But the search and the charges really set him on this path. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=540.9399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=545.6999999999999s)]
*  And Isaac, let me ask you about just the Trump campaign, the people running it. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=546.6999999999999s)]
*  We talked about Suzy Wiles. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=553.5799999999999s)]
*  They always seem to be a step ahead of Democrats. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=558.14s)]
*  And I say this going back to 2016. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=560.7s)]
*  At 6.30 p.m. election night, I called somebody high up in the Clinton campaign and they said, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=563.98s)]
*  we're going to win six out of the seven swing states, maybe all seven. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=571.94s)]
*  Our numbers are looking great. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=576.74s)]
*  I called Jared Kushner right afterwards. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=578.7s)]
*  I said, what is your data show? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=580.7800000000001s)]
*  He goes, we're going to win. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=583.22s)]
*  And he went state by state by state, called the states he was going to win. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=585.4200000000001s)]
*  And the ones that they would lose. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=591.22s)]
*  And I hung up the phone because they've been told by Sean Spicer, the RNC, earlier that [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=593.26s)]
*  morning that they were going to lose in a wipeout. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=597.0600000000001s)]
*  Jared called the states and I just kind of shook my head. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=600.0600000000001s)]
*  I go, poor guy. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=602.9000000000001s)]
*  It hasn't hit him yet that they're going to lose. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=604.6600000000001s)]
*  I noticed the same thing this entire campaign, which I will say, shocking outcome to me. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=608.46s)]
*  I really, I didn't think Donald Trump was going to be able to do it this time. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=615.86s)]
*  But every time I talk to somebody close to Trump, it was we're up by one, one and a half, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=621.26s)]
*  two points, we're going to win. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=627.38s)]
*  Well, she's up by five in the public polls. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=629.5s)]
*  No, she's not going to win. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=631.54s)]
*  I've never seen such confidence. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=633.2199999999999s)]
*  And this confidence was going all the way back to June. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=635.42s)]
*  Which gets to the second part of your title. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=639.5799999999999s)]
*  I'm so sorry for the long question. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=641.54s)]
*  It's just so endlessly fascinating me that these disruptors that are outside of Washington [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=643.02s)]
*  actually know politics better than the people that run against them. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=647.74s)]
*  I love your title and how Democrats lost America. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=652.06s)]
*  How is it that Trump and his people understood where America was so much better than Democrats [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=657.86s)]
*  and the media and establishment Washington, not only in 2016, but throughout the entire [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=665.74s)]
*  2024 campaign? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=672.02s)]
*  Well, the Democrats understood the problems that they had. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=675.1800000000001s)]
*  It was it was the perceptions about Biden's age when Biden was on the ticket. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=678.98s)]
*  And then when Harris took over, it was outrunning Biden's shadow and the economy. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=682.7s)]
*  And they never came up with an answer on that. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=687.3000000000001s)]
*  There's a great scene in the book during Harris's debate prep where they're they're going [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=689.5s)]
*  through the main issues. She has to talk about what are the points she's going to hit. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=694.38s)]
*  They get to the economy. They say, oh, let's come back to that. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=697.1s)]
*  We haven't figured it out. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=699.9s)]
*  They never come back to it. They never come up with an answer. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=700.86s)]
*  The Democrats knew they had to have a winning message on the economy, and they just never [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=703.9000000000001s)]
*  came up with that. And part of that, honestly, is that these were the people who came up [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=708.9000000000001s)]
*  with those economic policies, that they were the people who implemented those policies. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=712.94s)]
*  They believed that they were successful. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=717.82s)]
*  They wanted to defend them. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=720.0600000000001s)]
*  And so they weren't in the best position to take accountability for how Americans weren't [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=722.5s)]
*  feeling that. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=728.7800000000001s)]
*  The Trump campaign, on the other hand, those issues played to his strength, the economy [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=729.74s)]
*  and immigration. He was playing the hits. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=735.1800000000001s)]
*  And the big insight that the that the Trump campaign had this year in particular was there [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=737.34s)]
*  was so much focus on the gender gap. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=742.78s)]
*  And they looked at that and they said, you know, the gender gap goes both ways. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=744.98s)]
*  And if they can run up the score with men, then it's OK if they don't do as well with [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=749.1800000000001s)]
*  women. And they really leaned into that strategy and it worked for them. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=753.94s)]
*  They recognize that because of how Trump had driven away so many traditional Republicans, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=757.8199999999999s)]
*  the regular electorate was moving toward the Democrats. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=764.22s)]
*  They needed to expand that electorate. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=768.1s)]
*  They needed to bring in people who didn't vote as consistently historically. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=769.76s)]
*  And there was a lot of reasons to be skeptical of that. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=774.38s)]
*  It's like going after the high hanging fruit. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=776.4599999999999s)]
*  But they did it. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=778.78s)]
*  You know, one of the hardest things in politics, bringing in new voters, and they did it. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=779.78s)]
*  And to your point, Democrats still struggling with the postmortem of how to talk about all [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=782.1s)]
*  these issues. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=785.4599999999999s)]
*  Josh, Joe mentioned earlier some of the new reporting you guys have about that Trump Obama [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=786.58s)]
*  conversation at the Carter funeral. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=792.5400000000001s)]
*  But you also have new reporting about the Trump Biden Oval Office meeting after Trump [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=794.7800000000001s)]
*  wins. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=799.6600000000001s)]
*  He's going to take office again. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=800.6600000000001s)]
*  Talk to us a little bit about what you learned and the surprise how Donald Trump felt afterwards [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=802.94s)]
*  about it. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=808.2s)]
*  So they have a fairly diplomatic 90 minute meeting where they go around the world, talk [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=809.2s)]
*  about all the things you would expect, the various configurations, what world leaders [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=812.6600000000001s)]
*  like to deal with. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=817.9000000000001s)]
*  Biden in the telling of Trump and his chief of staff, Suzy Wiles, who was there, was physically [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=819.1s)]
*  frail but mentally much sharper than they expected him to be. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=824.9000000000001s)]
*  And in fact, when Trump left, he said, you know, that's a totally different guy than [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=830.1800000000001s)]
*  we saw on the debate stage. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=834.1600000000001s)]
*  What happened to him there? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=836.1800000000001s)]
*  And I think both of them came away and were surprised in that moment that Biden, while [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=838.06s)]
*  physically frail, that was kind of noticeable that his gait had sort of gotten worse, but [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=844.02s)]
*  mentally was not sort of the adult, you know, struggling to come up with sentences like [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=849.6199999999999s)]
*  we saw in June. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=855.6999999999999s)]
*  All right. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=859.8599999999999s)]
*  The new book entitled Twenty Twenty Four, How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9skrom1cUUk&t=860.8599999999999s)]
