# 'Completely unclear' if Iran's dangerous nuclear program has been ended, says senator
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY)
*  Let's bring in now Democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=0.0s)]
*  He serves on the Foreign Relations Committee and is in The Hague on a congressional delegation [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=4.04s)]
*  to the NATO summit. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=8.76s)]
*  President Trump heading there as well later today. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=9.76s)]
*  Senator Coons, thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=12.58s)]
*  Obviously, the conflict with the Middle East now a major topic of discussion where you [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=16.12s)]
*  are there at NATO. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=19.88s)]
*  Give us your assessment. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=21.04s)]
*  What do we know so far about the damage that was indeed inflicted on Iran's nuclear sites? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=22.8s)]
*  As we heard from the president initially, total annihilation, but since then the administration [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=29.6s)]
*  has had to acknowledge that these assessments take time, they're less certain. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=34.6s)]
*  What's the latest intel the Senate's received? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=38.08s)]
*  Well, I'm here and have not received a classified update or a battle damage assessment, but [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=40.44s)]
*  you're broadly right that it inevitably takes days if not weeks to know exactly what a [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  strike accomplished or didn't accomplish. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=53.040000000000006s)]
*  And the talk of the town here at the NATO summit is the commitment of all 32 members [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=56.199999999999996s)]
*  to significantly step up their investment in defense, in joint support for Ukraine's [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=61.959999999999994s)]
*  fight for freedom against Russian aggression, and in our European allies and partners taking [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=68.22s)]
*  on more of the military burden of collective security here in Europe. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=74.56s)]
*  But we will have to wait for more days to know whether or not Iran's dangerous nuclear [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=79.46s)]
*  program has in fact been ended. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=85.69999999999999s)]
*  A number of the European leaders we've already met with, Senator Shaheen is leading this [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=88.33999999999999s)]
*  delegation, have said this morning that if we have accomplished the end of the nuclear [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=92.69999999999999s)]
*  program by Iran, that would be a great thing, a big accomplishment. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=98.1s)]
*  But it is today completely unclear whether the Iranians relocated some of their fissile [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=102.74s)]
*  material before the American strikes on Fordow and Isfahan and whether or not they retain [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=108.06s)]
*  or might gain from Russia or other partners a renewed capability to enrich. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=114.06s)]
*  Senator Coons, this is Susan Page. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=120.94s)]
*  So lots of ifs, but if the ceasefire holds, if there's significant damage to the Iranian [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=122.38s)]
*  nuclear program, if they return to the table, does that mean that President Trump was right [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=127.5s)]
*  to drop those bombs Saturday night? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=133.98000000000002s)]
*  Look, I will of course agree that ending Iran's nuclear program would be a real positive for [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=137.34s)]
*  the region and for the United States. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=144.06s)]
*  Exactly how we went about it, the lack of consultation with Congress, the lack of advance [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=146.54s)]
*  notice, I think was a mistake. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=151.34s)]
*  And we don't know for sure what the real objective of the administration is. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=154.42s)]
*  We had on the same day Vice President Vance on a Sunday show saying we are really only [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=159.22s)]
*  focused on ending the enrichment program and then the president tweeting about maybe [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=164.74s)]
*  regime change isn't such a bad thing. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=170.14000000000001s)]
*  I think it's important to move to diplomacy, to find a way to make the ceasefire hold and [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=172.58s)]
*  to get Israel and Iran, the United States and our European partners at the table to [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=179.3s)]
*  secure a permanent end to Iran's dangerous effort to enrich uranium, to bomb levels and [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=184.98000000000002s)]
*  develop a nuclear weapon. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=191.02s)]
*  And of course, the administration yesterday also saying after that tweet, they're focused [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=194.26s)]
*  not on regime change but the destruction of the program. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=201.22s)]
*  I want to ask you before we talk about what you're going to be discussing in The Hague [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=205.22s)]
*  today, I want to ask you about the Middle East and talking about the transformation [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=211.18s)]
*  there with David Ignatius. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=219.54s)]
*  How much safer is the Middle East with Hamas destroyed or nearly destroyed, with Hezbollah [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=222.86s)]
*  severely damaged, Islamic Shi'a severely damaged, with Iran the weakest militarily? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=233.02s)]
*  It's been since 1979. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=239.46s)]
*  Again, we don't know what's going to happen with the ceasefire. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=241.82000000000002s)]
*  But over the past several months, these enemies of Israel and America, their terror networks [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=245.9s)]
*  have been shattered. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=254.54s)]
*  How does that transform the Middle East and the world? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=256.34s)]
*  Look, it significantly transforms the Middle East to have Hezbollah and Hamas and the proxies [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=259.74s)]
*  in Iraq largely degraded. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=267.74s)]
*  The Houthis are still actively engaged. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=270.66s)]
*  As you know, they until very recently were firing at American ships in the Red Sea and [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=273.26s)]
*  interdicting commerce and firing on Israel. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=278.42s)]
*  And frankly, the ongoing war in Gaza, which gets too little attention in this moment, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=281.98s)]
*  also needs to come to an end. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=286.7s)]
*  Humanitarian relief needs to be delivered into Gaza. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=289.22s)]
*  Hamas needs to be removed from Gaza completely. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=291.9s)]
*  There needs to be a resolution to that piece of this that began with the brutal, aggressive [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=296.06s)]
*  attack on civilians by Hamas on October 7th. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=302.97999999999996s)]
*  So what Israel has accomplished in terms of their strikes on Hezbollah and their success [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=306.82s)]
*  in really tamping down the regional proxies of Iran that have posed so much of a threat [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=312.78s)]
*  to Israel for decades is nothing short of spectacular. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=318.34s)]
*  But the ongoing war in Gaza needs to be brought to an end. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=322.70000000000005s)]
*  If Prime Minister Netanyahu could find his way towards embracing a two-state solution, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=326.74s)]
*  he has right in front of him the possibility of reconciliation with Saudi Arabia, the end [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=333.78000000000003s)]
*  of the Arab-Israeli conflict, and full integration of Israel into the region. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=339.3s)]
*  That's something that a number of us, a bipartisan group of senators, went over to meet with [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=344.54s)]
*  the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, the leader of Egypt, and Prime Minister Netanyahu just [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=350.21999999999997s)]
*  a few weeks after October 7th. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=356.26s)]
*  It is clearly something that is still possible. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=358.5s)]
*  Israel has achieved security, but that security won't last until there's an end to the war [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=361.5s)]
*  in Gaza and a resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict now decades old. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=366.41999999999996s)]
*  But that may now be possible. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=370.97999999999996s)]
*  And so as you were discussing with David Ignatius just a moment ago, Joe, we can and should [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=373.02s)]
*  dream of the possibility of peace in the region, but it's going to require some significant [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=378.62s)]
*  changes and compromises and, I think, American leadership. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=383.02s)]
*  Sam Steinswood, this has a question. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=388.02s)]
*  Sam, just reading the news out of the hay yesterday and looking how Great Britain and [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=389.74s)]
*  other countries in NATO are pledging to get to 5 percent GDP for the military spending, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=398.82s)]
*  that is significant. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=405.36s)]
*  Is that something that, even when I was in Congress, I was hearing members on the Republican [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=406.44s)]
*  and Democratic sides saying that Europe needs to step up and do more for the military funding? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=411.92s)]
*  It looks like they're moving in that direction, a last-minute glitch from Spain, but we'll [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=419.48s)]
*  see how that gets ironed out at the NATO conference. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=424.36s)]
*  Yeah, I just want to take a second to marvel at what the senator just said, an end to the [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=426.84000000000003s)]
*  Arab-Israeli conflict within reason. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=432.32s)]
*  I remember being a student two decades ago at Dartmouth writing my thesis on the Arab-Israeli [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=435.44s)]
*  conflict, thinking there was never going to be a resolution, but I suppose all these dominoes [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=440.67999999999995s)]
*  are falling in a certain direction. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=446.03999999999996s)]
*  Perhaps we can dream big about that. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=447.67999999999995s)]
*  As for NATO, Senator, I do want to ask you about this gathering. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=449.94s)]
*  When the meeting was planned, obviously the Iran-Israeli conflict was not a thing. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=453.96s)]
*  Now it is, of course, but it clearly has impacts on other theaters. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=459.23999999999995s)]
*  I was watching an interview with Prime Minister Zelenskyy of Ukraine this morning, where he [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=464.35999999999996s)]
*  was talking about the way in which he was worried that the Iranian conflict might bleed [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=471.55999999999995s)]
*  into the Ukrainian conflict, and how it might hurt weapons supplies to Ukraine. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=475.76s)]
*  At the same time, of course, we have Russia, who has come out and said, look, the attacks [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=480.32s)]
*  on Iran we vehemently oppose, and that they're going to help facilitate Iranians' achievement [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=485.32s)]
*  of a nuclear weapon. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=490.64s)]
*  So can you talk about those two contributing factors to the Ukraine-Russia conflict, and [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=491.8s)]
*  how the current crisis in Iran might affect all that? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=497.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=500.36s)]
*  Well, Sam, as we all know, Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine, its aggression against [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=501.36s)]
*  Ukraine faltered as the Ukrainians stood strong and with Western help began to push back. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=506.44s)]
*  And so Russia now, a year and a half ago, brought in Iranian drones and Iranian resources [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=513.68s)]
*  to help bolster their fight against Ukraine. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=521.3599999999999s)]
*  They've also more recently brought in North Korean troops. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=525.04s)]
*  And so as the Ukrainian conflict, as Russia's aggression against Ukraine has changed, there's [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=528.4799999999999s)]
*  been dramatic modernization of drone warfare. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=534.88s)]
*  And there is now the very real risk that Russia, having lost one close partner in the region [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=538.4399999999999s)]
*  in Syria, will now decide to come to Iran's aid to repay their support for Russia's aggression [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=543.4599999999999s)]
*  against Ukraine by helping them with moving towards a bomb, or at least ensuring that [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=550.24s)]
*  their enrichment program does not come to an end. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=555.24s)]
*  We will be meeting with President Zelensky later today here. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=558.6s)]
*  And I think it's important that Americans realize that our adversaries around the world [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=562.04s)]
*  are coordinating and coalescing in critical and in threatening ways. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqsK0UT7WCY&t=566.6s)]
