# Republican megabill would cut critical research funding
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI)
*  Cutting-edge research into a potential cure for cancer could be severely impacted by the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=0.0s)]
*  Republicans' mega bill currently working its way through Congress. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=5.2s)]
*  NBC News correspondent David Noriega met up with a team of scientists who are on a quest [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=8.68s)]
*  for biochemical compounds that could hold the key to everything from a cure for brain [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=13.76s)]
*  cancer to non-addictive pain medications. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=18.88s)]
*  David joins us now. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=22.2s)]
*  David, good morning. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=23.2s)]
*  What did you hear from these scientists about the potential impact of this big bill? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=24.68s)]
*  Well, when these scientists look at the massive budget cuts that are buried in this spending [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=29.08s)]
*  bill on top of cuts already either enacted by Doge or attempted by Doge and in some cases [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=34.64s)]
*  tied up in the courts, what they see is an effort to dismantle the very system that has [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=40.72s)]
*  made the U.S. a world leader in scientific research. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=45.1s)]
*  That's the system where the federal government gives grants to scientists based at universities [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=48.4s)]
*  to do the kind of experimental, risky scientific research that nobody else will pay for. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=52.66s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=58.06s)]
*  On a cloudy San Diego morning, we set out to find treasure on the ocean floor. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=60.18s)]
*  We're with a team of researchers from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UCSD. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=64.06s)]
*  What they do is they come out here regularly, dive down to the bottom of the ocean and collect [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=69.25999999999999s)]
*  microbial life that could potentially be used for revolutionary medicines. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=72.9s)]
*  Microbiologist Paul Jensen thinks the ocean could hold the key to everything from non-addictive [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=77.86s)]
*  pain meds to a cure for cancer. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=82.02s)]
*  But first, he has to go down and find it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=84.5s)]
*  So what's happening right now is that Paul and his team are down on the ocean floor, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=89.42s)]
*  about 50 feet down, and they're setting these hoops. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=93.42s)]
*  They're literally like embroidery hoops that you buy at a craft store. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=96.38s)]
*  Those hoops hold a special resin that captures chemical compounds, many of them never observed [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=99.38s)]
*  before. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=103.82s)]
*  The only way I can describe it is that it's an embarrassment of riches. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=104.82s)]
*  Back at the lab, Jensen's team breaks down and studies what they gathered at sea. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=107.82s)]
*  The work shows real promise. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=112.46s)]
*  One of Jensen's discoveries is in clinical trials for treating brain cancer. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=114.3s)]
*  To develop that drug, he worked with biochemist Bradley Moore. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=118.13999999999999s)]
*  And like scientists around the country, Moore and Jensen fear their life's work might soon [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=121.5s)]
*  come to a screeching halt. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=126.46s)]
*  How much of the work that you do is funded by the U.S. federal government? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=128.54s)]
*  Pretty much the vast majority. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=132.78s)]
*  None of this would be happening without federal funding. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=134.06s)]
*  After President Donald Trump, the U.S. government has set out to aggressively cut funding to [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=136.78s)]
*  precisely this kind of scientific research. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=141.3s)]
*  Much of that comes from the National Institutes of Health, which for decades has been a science [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=144.74s)]
*  powerhouse backing the research behind countless medical breakthroughs. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=148.86s)]
*  But the budget bill already approved by the House would slash the NIH by 40 percent. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=153.06s)]
*  And that's on top of Department of Government efficiency cuts already underway that researchers [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=158.46s)]
*  say threaten to cripple projects funded by the agency. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=162.98s)]
*  Some of that is happening already. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=166.3s)]
*  The government has stopped payments on one of Moore's existing NIH grants, forcing him [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=167.9s)]
*  to find other ways to keep paying his staff. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=171.54000000000002s)]
*  We haven't been paid for three months. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=173.78s)]
*  Very soon we're going to have to make some really tough choices about letting people [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=175.94s)]
*  go just because our funding has been frozen. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=179.5s)]
*  The White House and the NIH did not respond to requests for comment. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=182.54000000000002s)]
*  But Republicans have said the cuts are meant to target waste and fraud. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=186.62s)]
*  And like many scientists, Moore and Jensen say you probably could make the system more [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=190.38000000000002s)]
*  efficient, but that the proposed cuts would do much more than that. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=194.22s)]
*  It's killing the goose that lays the golden egg. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=198.7s)]
*  And what the federal budget has done, it's allowed us to do the risky experiments where [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=200.7s)]
*  a lot of times we fail. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=207.88s)]
*  And during that failure, we make amazing discoveries that come out of it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=211.38s)]
*  What's at stake, they say, is nothing less than America's standing in the world. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=217.3s)]
*  It's been a hugely successful model, right? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=221.26s)]
*  It's why we have so many Nobel laureates. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=224.18s)]
*  It's why we have so many discoveries here. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=225.82s)]
*  Okay, it works. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=227.7s)]
*  Why do we want to break a system that's working so incredibly well? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=228.7s)]
*  I just can't understand it. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=232.57999999999998s)]
*  Something you hear a lot in the scientific community is that that system you just heard [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=236.5s)]
*  Paul Jensen talking about took decades to build. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=240.02s)]
*  And even if the next president or the next Congress wants to go back on these cuts, it's [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=242.7s)]
*  going to take a lot longer to rebuild it than it takes to break it down. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=247.06s)]
*  Back to you guys. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=251.5s)]
*  Fascinating. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=252.54s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=253.54s)]
*  And it's just one of a thousand stories you could find of impacts of this bill, potentially. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=254.54s)]
*  NBC News correspondent David Noriega, thanks so much for your reporting. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=258.82s)]
*  You know, Sam Stein, you look at that report, you look at slashing NIH or cuts to the VA [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=262.02s)]
*  by Doge or potentially to Medicaid and people's health care in this big, beautiful bill. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=268.1s)]
*  And it is maddening to a lot of people that they're looking to trim the fat in those places [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=273.54s)]
*  while giving tax cuts to extremely rich people in corporations. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=278.66s)]
*  That report is about as infuriating a thing you can see on TV. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=283.46000000000004s)]
*  What we are doing to science in America is blasphemous, honestly. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=287.38000000000005s)]
*  We've been a leader on the global stage on scientific development and research and investing [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=291.98s)]
*  in it. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=297.62s)]
*  And we are about to just absolutely sacrifice that for tax cuts for the rich. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=298.62s)]
*  And look, everything in that report was accurate. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=302.86s)]
*  I would say almost understated. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=307.38s)]
*  I've had conversations with people at universities across the country. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=308.94s)]
*  They are slashing budgets by tens of millions of dollars because of indirect cost caps. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=312.7s)]
*  You talk to people in the field, it's not that it's going to set us back and we'll have [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=317.56s)]
*  to rebuild and it's going to be really difficult to rebuild. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=321.34s)]
*  It's going to set us back and we may never rebuild. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=323.85999999999996s)]
*  We may never. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=325.94s)]
*  That's absolutely right. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=326.94s)]
*  And that's because, frankly, right now, Europeans, Canadians, Chinese are looking to take our [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=327.94s)]
*  scientists and bring them to their country, fund them, and they will stay there for 5, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=333.46s)]
*  10, 15 years because you need a 5, 10, 15 year ramp in order to do your research. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=338.9s)]
*  You're not going to come right back to America. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=343.18s)]
*  This is your life's work. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=344.94s)]
*  You feel you're on the verge of a breakthrough and your lab just got defunded. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=346.47999999999996s)]
*  And the University of Marseille or Lyon or in Bonn is asking and saying, hey, we'll fund [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=351.62s)]
*  your lab. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=360.62s)]
*  No, we'll give you more. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=361.78000000000003s)]
*  Come on over. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=363.98s)]
*  What are you going to do? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=364.98s)]
*  You're going to go over there because this is your life's work and you believe it's potentially [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=365.98s)]
*  important for medicine, for space travel, for whatever. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=371.74s)]
*  It's just, it's so stupid. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=377.22s)]
*  It's hard to really comprehend why we would surrender this massive advantage that we've [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=381.1s)]
*  had for a century. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=386.74s)]
*  It's like banning international students from Harvard, say, incredibly short-sighted when [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=389.86s)]
*  you look at all the benefits these programs give us. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=393.66s)]
*  Sam Stein, Eugene Robinson, thank you both as always. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uccnanj1NQI&t=395.94s)]
