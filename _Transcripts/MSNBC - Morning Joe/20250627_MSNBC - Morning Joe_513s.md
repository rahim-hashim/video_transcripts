# 'Fear and insecurity': Tom Nichols on Hegseth briefing, president's power to launch nuclear weapons
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I)
*  New piece for the Atlantic, our next guest poses this question. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=0.0s)]
*  Why does the power to launch nuclear weapons rest with a single American? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=4.16s)]
*  Staff writer Tom Nichols writes in part this. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=8.08s)]
*  At this very moment, a small plastic card of top secret codes, the president's [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  personal key to America's nuclear arsenal, is resting in one of President Donald Trump's [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=15.76s)]
*  pockets as he fixates on shows of dominance, fumes about enemies, real and perceived, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=20.88s)]
*  and allows misinformation to sway his decision-making, all while regional wars [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=26.56s)]
*  simmer around the world. And Tom joins us now. Tom, we'll shift to Iran in just a moment, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=31.52s)]
*  but let's start with your piece. I read it last night. It is chilling. I would not recommend [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=38.32s)]
*  others to read it right before bed. You know, it is to walk us through a little bit of the history [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=44.0s)]
*  here. Why this awesome power lies with one person and one person alone, and are there really any [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=49.2s)]
*  safeguards in place? To answer the last question first, there aren't any safeguards in place, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=58.0s)]
*  because the system is designed that way. The system is not designed to prevent the president [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=65.04s)]
*  from acting. The system, as our editor-in-chief Jeff Goldberg notes in a piece in the same issue, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=70.48s)]
*  has a bias toward action. And all of this is a function of the Cold War. When we had a massive [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=78.39999999999999s)]
*  nuclear arsenal, the Soviet Union had a massive nuclear arsenal, and what we were always expecting [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=86.88s)]
*  was that a crisis would escalate to a strike on the United States that would completely [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=91.91999999999999s)]
*  decapitate our leadership, wipe out our nuclear deterrent, obliterate our cities, and leave the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=97.28s)]
*  president with just moments to act. And at that moment, you don't want the president to have to [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=104.72s)]
*  call 14 members of Congress and schedule a hearing and make sure that the Senate parliamentarians are [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=108.96s)]
*  okay with it and all of that. So the system, really, the entire nuclear infrastructure of [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=117.84s)]
*  the United States, that we have bombers, submarines, land-based missiles, that we have a single person [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  in control, all of this comes from our experience during the Cold War when everything was organized [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=129.6s)]
*  around protecting the United States from a massive attack, possibly by surprise from the Soviet Union. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=135.12s)]
*  It's just, it's set up that way. It's not a flaw. It's not a bug. It's a feature. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=142.4s)]
*  And as you and Jeff both wrote, there have been some close calls over the years. Now talk to us [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=147.84s)]
*  about, if you will, fix this power that President, at this moment, President Trump has in the current [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=154.64s)]
*  global setting, where we have seen more and more countries race to develop these weapons [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=161.44s)]
*  that seems to maybe just raise the threshold for danger. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=167.11999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, former Secretary of Defense Bill Perry once said, you know, when you talk about chilling [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  quotes, he said, he thinks a nuclear war is less likely, but the use of a nuclear weapon somewhere [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=178.64s)]
*  is now much more likely. And the thing the system isn't really built to deal with is a president who [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=185.04s)]
*  wants to use nuclear weapons first for any reason he chooses. All of this command and control was [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  bounded by the existence of the Cold War. Every president knew that the key to hell that he carried [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=199.76s)]
*  in his pocket was there to, again, to protect the United States from a sudden attack. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=205.68s)]
*  With the end of the Cold War and the change in the international situation, that's still a good [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=211.68s)]
*  reason to have one person in charge of nuclear retaliation. You know, if Russia or China tomorrow [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=218.08s)]
*  decided for whatever reason to start attacking the United States, you'd still want one person [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=223.76000000000002s)]
*  being able to issue the order to retaliate. But what every president can do, including Trump and [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=229.52s)]
*  Biden and Obama before him, is use nuclear weapons at will for whatever reason. The first [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=234.72s)]
*  review that George W. Bush did on nuclear weapons included countries as possible targets that didn't [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=243.6s)]
*  even have nuclear weapons. And that is a problem. You know, the old Cold War system never really [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=249.44s)]
*  thought about what happens if a president decides he just wants to nuke, you know, somebody that's [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=256.24s)]
*  aggravating him or that he may want to use nuclear weapons because he thinks it's the only way to get [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=262.64s)]
*  a job done. Hi, Tom. It's Molly Johnfest. It's long been said that Trump 2.0 does not have grownups [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=268.24s)]
*  in the room, right, that there is a culture of sycophancy around the president. I wonder if you [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=276.08s)]
*  could speak to how that relates to this issue. If the president wants to use nuclear weapons, the [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  first thing we assume any president would do is to call his civilian and military advisors. And the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=287.6s)]
*  problem, as you say, Molly, there aren't any grownups in the room. Pete Hegseth is not a real [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=293.04s)]
*  secretary of defense. He has no qualifications for it. He's in way, way over his head. As you saw it, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=297.28000000000003s)]
*  his core competency is to stand behind the lectern and Hector reporters, including his old colleagues. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=304.0s)]
*  That's about the depth of—he probably would have made a good press spokesman, but he shouldn't be [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=311.84000000000003s)]
*  secretary of defense. And at that moment, if President Trump says, I'm thinking of using a [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=316.64s)]
*  nuclear weapon, you want someone with the fortitude and the courage and the independent standing to say, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=321.84s)]
*  look, we need to talk about this. You need to reconsider this. And with the possible [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=328.96s)]
*  exception of General Kaine, it's difficult to imagine who in the room is going to say, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=335.03999999999996s)]
*  let's think this through, Mr. President. Maybe this is a bad idea. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=341.52s)]
*  Donald Trump, speaking of things that are a feature, not a bug, Donald Trump intentionally [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=344.64s)]
*  stacked his cabinet with yes men. He doesn't want to hear that again. He heard that kind of stuff [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=349.59999999999997s)]
*  in his first term, and he learned from it. And so there won't be anybody in the room [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=357.36s)]
*  who's going to say to him anything but, great idea, sir, and that's a problem. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=362.24s)]
*  Tom, I was thinking, as you were talking about, also the reporting in the last few years about [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=367.44s)]
*  Trump asking repeatedly, like, why haven't we used a nuclear weapon and how terrifying [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=372.16s)]
*  those questions were to members of the Joint Chief in previous administrations. But I wanted [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=377.20000000000005s)]
*  to shift a little bit to Iran and this sort of, as you said, Pete Hegseth trying to manage what is [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=381.20000000000005s)]
*  clearly something above his capability. Even for people who supported potentially the strike on [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=387.28000000000003s)]
*  Iran, it feels like the administration is just not willing to speak kind of honestly about even [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=393.84000000000003s)]
*  what's obvious that we might not really know whether it was a success, whether the uranium [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=399.36s)]
*  had been moved, et cetera. What is the sort of press engagement and attacking from Hegseth, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=404.72s)]
*  say to you also about in even a heightened, more extreme context, what might happen and [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=411.52000000000004s)]
*  what the Americans could expect? Yeah, that's a great question. And what it really shows, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=417.76s)]
*  every time I see Hegseth behind the podium or any of this national security team, what comes out of [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=423.44s)]
*  them to me is fear and insecurity. They're afraid of the boss and they are deeply insecure, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=427.84s)]
*  which is why they don't talk to the American public like grownups, like adults who would say, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=433.91999999999996s)]
*  look, we did our best. We think we got most of it. We're still doing the assessment. Again, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=439.11999999999995s)]
*  with the exception of General Kaine, who as a career military person says, we have to do [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=444.4s)]
*  battle damage assessment. That takes a long time. We're working on it. That instead, it's this [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=449.44s)]
*  constant kind of TV show authoritarian bravado. We did it. We got them. It's over. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=456.8s)]
*  That's not how the real world works. That's how TV works. And they don't understand that, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=463.76s)]
*  or they don't want to understand it because nuance, they feel like nuance and speaking [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=469.04s)]
*  like adults to millions of Americans makes them look weak. And I think that's a tone set from the [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=474.24s)]
*  Oval Office staff writer at the Atlantic, Tom Nichols. Thank you. His important and terrifying [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=480.08000000000004s)]
*  new piece online now. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEf8eOWGe3I&t=485.36s)]
