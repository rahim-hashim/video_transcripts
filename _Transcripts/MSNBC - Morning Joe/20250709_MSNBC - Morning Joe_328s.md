# Emergency room visits for tick bites near record levels
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U)
*  Welcome back. Tick bite cases are approaching record highs this summer as emergency rooms [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=0.0s)]
*  have reported the largest number of tick related visits in nearly a decade. Residents of the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=6.4s)]
*  tri-state area face the most severe danger of bites according to Fordham University Tick [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=12.0s)]
*  Index, which is a rating system that estimates bite risk this week. It's at a nine out of [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=18.64s)]
*  ten. Yikes. Joining us now, director of the University of Rhode Island's Tick and Counter [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=26.08s)]
*  Resource Center, Professor Thomas Mather and director and associate research scientist for [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=32.0s)]
*  Vectory Ecology at the Lewis-Culder Center at Fordham University, Dr. Tom Daniels. Dr. Daniels, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=39.839999999999996s)]
*  I'll start with you. Is it more ticks or more deer? Where do you start at figuring out what the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=46.64s)]
*  reason is for the increase? And I feel like I'm reading a lot about ticks in cities. Please explain. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=55.84s)]
*  It is more ticks and it is a lot of deer. That's part of the equation that we don't talk about [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=63.68000000000001s)]
*  very often. The fact is that we don't have very high tick populations in the absence of white [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=69.76s)]
*  tail deer. And we've got more deer in the country now than we probably ever had in our history. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=76.08000000000001s)]
*  That being said, the tick numbers vary from year to year. Some years are relatively low, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=81.44s)]
*  some years are relatively high. This happens to be a high year. And reasons for that are not clear. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=87.2s)]
*  Tom Mather may have a different take on it. But my understanding is that, yeah, we see a lot of [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=94.08s)]
*  reference to global warming, for example, and that may be part of the picture. But the fact is, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=101.84s)]
*  it's a complicated life cycle this tick has. And there are a number of things that affect those tick [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=107.6s)]
*  numbers over time. And so we don't really have a good answer as to what the tick numbers are of. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=114.08s)]
*  Professor Mather, I'll let you take your best bet at also the reasons. And also, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=119.19999999999999s)]
*  where are they the worst? What can people do? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=126.56s)]
*  Yeah. So thanks for having me on. And I'd like to say hello to my colleague Tom there. I haven't [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=129.44s)]
*  seen him for a while. So I think that the deer issue is really important. But when we think about [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=138.0s)]
*  ticks in more places, it's that some of these ticks that cause problems, even black-legged ticks [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  that transmit the Lyme disease germ, are being found more and more often in peri-urban settings. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=152.24s)]
*  And that's because deer have sort of figured out how to habituate with people a lot. I think [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=158.24s)]
*  people have helped that a lot. They do a lot of feeding in their backyards and everything. And [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=164.0s)]
*  that just increases the deer numbers, but also increases sort of the reach of the deer into [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=167.92000000000002s)]
*  more and more populated areas where more people are being exposed to ticks. And so that's probably [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=174.48000000000002s)]
*  one of the driving factors right now. But when we think about tick encounters, basically, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=180.96s)]
*  we think about tick reproduction. And deer are important in tick reproduction. But we also think [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=188.56s)]
*  about tick survival. And so the weather conditions really are an important factor in all of this. And [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=193.52s)]
*  so this year, we just had in the early spring, when these ticks start to become active, we've had moist [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=203.52s)]
*  cool conditions. Now we have hot and drier conditions, especially in the areas where these [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=210.0s)]
*  ticks are abundant in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Upper Midwest. So their numbers will probably [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  be starting to drop a little bit, which is pretty typical for this time of year. But still, they're [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=221.20000000000002s)]
*  in urban settings more and more because I think the deer are allowing tick reproduction in those [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  areas. And anecdotally, this back up the stats, seeming like tick incidents on the rise, including [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=236.24s)]
*  on the sidelines of the aforementioned travel baseball tournaments. So Dr. Daniels, the question [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=242.88s)]
*  to you is, are we seeing an accompanying rise with some of the more dangerous diseases that come with [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=248.16s)]
*  ticks, particularly Lyme disease? What's the worry level here? Lyme disease is still the big one to [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=253.6s)]
*  be concerned about. It has a relatively high infection rate in the ticks, somewhere around [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=261.12s)]
*  30% of the nymphs are infected with the agent that causes Lyme disease. But the tick itself is [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=265.6s)]
*  something of a Pandora's box in terms of pathogens. And so in this area alone, we know that the tick [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=270.8s)]
*  can transmit at least five different agents. And so yes, we anticipate that those infection rates [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=278.24s)]
*  are also going to go up simply because there are so many ticks now potentially infected [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=286.08s)]
*  that are biting more people. All right, we'll continue to follow this Dr. Tom Daniels and [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=290.96s)]
*  Professor Thomas Mather. Thank you both very much for coming on the show this morning. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvFmEOL8W6U&t=297.03999999999996s)]
