# 'What was the imminent threat' to the U.S.? Leader Jeffries demands answers from Trump on Iran
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE)
*  Politicians need to lecture less and listen more. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=0.0s)]
*  And when we saw New York have the greatest swing towards Trump in the entire nation, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=3.08s)]
*  11.5 points, we saw that it took place in the hearts of immigrant New York. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  And so I went there to Fordham Road in the Bronx, Hillside Avenue in Queens. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=10.4s)]
*  I asked those voters, why did they vote for him? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=13.36s)]
*  And they told me they remembered having more money in their pocket four years ago. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=16.0s)]
*  I asked them what it would take to bring them back to the Democratic Party. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=18.96s)]
*  They said a relentless focus on an economic agenda. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=21.92s)]
*  And when I told them my plan to freeze the rent, make buses fast and free, deliver universal [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=24.82s)]
*  child care, they said that they would vote for me. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=28.76s)]
*  And I think ultimately that's what we need is a recognition that for too long our party [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=30.8s)]
*  has moved away from working class voters. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=34.44s)]
*  It's time we actually bring them back. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=36.96s)]
*  And it's time we do so with an agenda that is not only urgent, but possible. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=38.64s)]
*  It's just a question of political will. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=41.84s)]
*  That's Ron Mondani earlier this month on Morning Joe talking about Democrats who believe the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  party has moved too far away from voters in the stunning upset. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=49.44s)]
*  The 33 year old state assemblyman has declared victory over former Governor Andrew Cuomo [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=54.32s)]
*  in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=59.4s)]
*  Cuomo has conceded and leader Jeffries joins us now. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=62.76s)]
*  Leader Jeffries, thanks so much for being with us. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=67.4s)]
*  I'm wondering, do you consider his win last night in New York City, do you think it provides [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=69.68s)]
*  a roadmap for Democrats running in 2026 on how to energize the base? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=75.4s)]
*  I think what's clear is that the relentless focus on affordability had great appeal all [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=82.02000000000001s)]
*  across the city of New York. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=88.78s)]
*  He also clearly outworked, out organized and out communicated the opposition. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=90.44s)]
*  And when someone is successful in being able to do all three things at the same time, it's [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=97.82000000000001s)]
*  usually going to work out for them. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=103.18s)]
*  Yeah, the New York Times editorialized that he was not qualified to be mayor. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=105.18s)]
*  Of course, the Wall Street Journal and others say that he is far too extreme on economic [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=110.78s)]
*  issues and even issues involving Israel. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=116.46000000000001s)]
*  I'm curious what your thoughts are on him ideologically. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=119.18s)]
*  Is that, does he have an ideology that you would want your candidates in 2026 to have? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=123.1s)]
*  Well from the standpoint of House Democrats and what our focus has been, clearly we have [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=132.42000000000002s)]
*  an affordability crisis in the United States of America and our focus will continue to [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=139.34s)]
*  be on driving down the high cost living in this country. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=144.14000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump promised to lower costs on day one. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=148.54s)]
*  Costs haven't gone down, they're going up. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=151.94s)]
*  He's crashing the economy in real time. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=153.54s)]
*  His tariffs are going to impose thousands of dollars in additional cost on everyday Americans [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=155.98000000000002s)]
*  per year. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=161.94s)]
*  And he may even be driving us toward a recession. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=163.3s)]
*  The reason why Donald Trump has become so unpopular is because he's failed the country [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=165.42s)]
*  on the economy. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=170.57999999999998s)]
*  And so our vision is going to be for an affordable America, work hard, play by the rules, live [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=171.57999999999998s)]
*  the good life, provide a comfortable living for yourself and for your family. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=178.78s)]
*  That means being able to actually afford a home, educate your children, have access to [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=184.46s)]
*  health care, go on vacation with your children and your family every now and then. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=189.85999999999999s)]
*  And of course, Joe, one day retire with grace and dignity. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=194.86s)]
*  So Democrats look at Donald Trump's approval ratings and you have a lot of other Democrats [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=199.54000000000002s)]
*  and people on media asking the question, why is the Democratic Party's approval ratings, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=206.14000000000001s)]
*  why are they lower than Donald Trump's? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=211.46s)]
*  I take it that's something that you all grapple with every day. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=214.54000000000002s)]
*  Why has the Democratic Party over the past year found itself at sort of its lowest ebb [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=217.66000000000003s)]
*  in recent history? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=224.01999999999998s)]
*  And how did Democrats get out of that? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=226.42s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's a very important question. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=228.7s)]
*  And listen, institutions are unpopular right now in the United States of America. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=231.5s)]
*  And that includes, of course, the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=236.26s)]
*  The dynamics that we have to work through, of course, one, Donald Trump and Republicans [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=240.82s)]
*  have given the American people every reason to run away from them. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=247.26s)]
*  And it's going to be important for us to continue to make clear why this administration failed [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=252.17999999999998s)]
*  on the economy, failed foreign policy, trying to take away health care from tens of millions [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=257.09999999999997s)]
*  of Americans, ripping food out of the mouths of children and seniors and veterans. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=262.32s)]
*  Of course, all of that is problematic. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=267.06s)]
*  All of that is unpopular. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=269.46s)]
*  That's why the one big ugly bill has such a high disapproval rate in the United States [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=270.46s)]
*  of America. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=275.97999999999996s)]
*  We also recognize as Democrats that it's going to be important for us to articulate our affirmative [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=276.97999999999996s)]
*  agenda what we stand for. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=281.7s)]
*  This principle of working hard and playing by the rules, being able to live the good [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=284.3s)]
*  life, an affordable life for hardworking American taxpayers. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=287.53999999999996s)]
*  And that is something that we're going to have to lean into. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=293.21999999999997s)]
*  The other thing I'd note, Joe, as you know, perhaps the most important thing in terms [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=295.62s)]
*  of a midterm election dynamic is what's the generic ballot say to us? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=299.62s)]
*  Every single significant generic ballot poll has House Democrats beating House Republicans [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=306.38s)]
*  consistently, including a recent Fox News poll that had us up by about eight points. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=313.14s)]
*  And so at the end of the day, yes, we have to lean into improving the Democratic brand. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=319.1s)]
*  But at the end of the day, what will be most significant, most important is how our vision [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=324.42s)]
*  contrasts with the management of this president, which has been a failure in the United States [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=330.72s)]
*  of America. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=338.20000000000005s)]
*  Leader Jeffries, let's turn you now to the situation in Iran. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=339.20000000000005s)]
*  We played some sound from you earlier in the show, expressing unhappiness that the administration [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=342.8s)]
*  briefing was postponed. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=347.64000000000004s)]
*  The White House saying it's well, it's so Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=350.16s)]
*  can be part of it later this week. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=353.24s)]
*  Is that acceptable to you? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=356.28000000000003s)]
*  And do you have concerns the administration is not being fully forthcoming as to what [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=358.56s)]
*  actually transpired in Iran over the weekend? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=363.52s)]
*  Yes, there's every reason to be concerned. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=365.76s)]
*  There was this briefing that had been scheduled to take place in the House of Representatives [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=368.56s)]
*  and in the Senate. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=373.16s)]
*  There was absolutely no reason that we've been provided that it should have been canceled [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=374.16s)]
*  in terms of the important questions that need to be asked and answered by the Trump administration. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=379.52s)]
*  What was the imminent threat to the safety and security of the United States of America [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=385.76s)]
*  that justified this strike without seeking the congressional authorization required by [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=390.08s)]
*  the Constitution? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=396.84s)]
*  What is the assessment of the damage that was done to Iran's nuclear program? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=398.36s)]
*  Was it completely and totally decimated? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=402.84s)]
*  No evidence to date has been provided to suggest that that representation made by Donald Trump [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=405.0s)]
*  is accurate. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=410.8s)]
*  What is the plan to avoid another costly failed war in the Middle East? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=411.84000000000003s)]
*  Why was aggressive diplomacy abandoned by the Trump administration, notwithstanding the [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=419.64s)]
*  success that had taken place under President Obama's administration and actually pushing [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=424.40000000000003s)]
*  back Iran's nuclear aspirations? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=430.96000000000004s)]
*  These are questions that need to be answered by the administration and the fact that they [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=433.88s)]
*  continue to run away from confronting these situations on Capitol Hill is very problematic. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=438.48s)]
*  So leader Jeffries, to that point, you and many people have had your position in the [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=448.0s)]
*  decades before this, have expressed frustration when presidents don't seek congressional authority [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=453.12s)]
*  for military action like this. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=460.32s)]
*  Do you feel like that a greater good was achieved here if Iran's program was, if not destroyed, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=463.04s)]
*  at least significantly delayed? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=468.28s)]
*  What should be the next steps for this administration in this process? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=470.23999999999995s)]
*  Well, to be clear, Iran can never be allowed to become a nuclear capable power. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=473.15999999999997s)]
*  Iran is a sworn enemy of the United States, of Israel, of Jordan, of our allies in the [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=480.0s)]
*  Middle East, a sworn enemy of the free world. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=484.88s)]
*  But the question, of course, is was this strike successful in meaningfully pushing back Iran's [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=488.44s)]
*  nuclear aspirations or is it going to complicate things in the Middle East in ways that put [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=497.28s)]
*  our men and women in uniform, American troops and America in harm's way? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=502.96s)]
*  That's simply the reason that having an all-member briefing on Capitol Hill sooner rather than [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=508.52s)]
*  later is important so these answers can be obtained for the American people, the representatives [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=515.16s)]
*  of the American people in the United States Congress. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=521.28s)]
*  That is the reason, fundamentally, why it's been Congress that was given the power to [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=523.96s)]
*  declare war to authorize military force. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=528.6800000000001s)]
*  And when administrations act differently, they have an obligation and a responsibility [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=531.96s)]
*  to provide the facts, the evidence, and the truth justifying their actions to the American [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=538.0400000000001s)]
*  people. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=544.0400000000001s)]
*  Well, this has been the debate. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=545.0400000000001s)]
*  We talked about it yesterday with another member of Congress. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=546.64s)]
*  This has been the debate going back 30, 40, 50 years. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=548.88s)]
*  Obviously, Republicans were saying this after Barack Obama attacked Libya. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=552.76s)]
*  Republicans were saying this with Bill Clinton in the 1990s on Kosovo. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=557.88s)]
*  But if you're going to have a surprise attack with B-2 bombers that are going to be going [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=562.96s)]
*  over to Iran, striking their nuclear facilities, do you think it's a good idea to inform 535 [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=571.04s)]
*  before that operation takes off? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=580.04s)]
*  Well, the key here is what was the imminent nature of the threat that justified immediate [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=585.3199999999999s)]
*  military action and surprise military action if there was no imminent threat? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=595.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=600.4s)]
*  So the United Nations, I'm curious if you're concerned, the United Nations nuclear agency, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=601.4s)]
*  the IAEA had said that Iran had already enriched uranium up to 60 percent. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=606.72s)]
*  And as you know, the jump from 60 to 100 percent is negligible and had enough enriched uranium [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=614.24s)]
*  for several weapons. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=621.72s)]
*  Would you consider that to be a considerable enough, a considerable enough threat to strike [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=625.0400000000001s)]
*  Iran under those circumstances? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=631.52s)]
*  Well, certainly it's a challenging situation. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=633.8s)]
*  But one of the reasons why we need a briefing, Joe, is to have an understanding, was that [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=636.0799999999999s)]
*  enriched uranium even damaged or was it removed by the Iranians prior to the strike? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=640.52s)]
*  We don't know the answers to that question. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=645.68s)]
*  It certainly is something that should be talked about and the American people should be informed [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=647.76s)]
*  about the reality of whether it was a successful strike or not. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=653.56s)]
*  In terms of the Iranian nuclear threat, I think we've all been clear that Iran can [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=656.92s)]
*  never be permitted to become nuclear capable. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=662.96s)]
*  But the Constitution is not a mere inconvenience. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=666.36s)]
*  It's the reality. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=669.52s)]
*  And if members of the executive branch, if hawkish individuals across the country want [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=671.0400000000001s)]
*  to change things, it's Article 1, Section 8, Clause 11, they can put forward a constitutional [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=676.2800000000001s)]
*  amendment. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=681.12s)]
*  But the framers of this country saw fit to vest this authority within the House and the [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=682.12s)]
*  Senate, not the executive branch. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=688.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=691.32s)]
*  And at what point should that be triggered? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=692.6400000000001s)]
*  Should it be triggered by every strike, like, for instance, Barack Obama in 2011 in Libya, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=697.1600000000001s)]
*  or countless strikes by the Bush administration and the Obama administration after September [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=703.9200000000001s)]
*  11? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=711.7600000000001s)]
*  Is it every strike, or is it when you were going in, sending troops in? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=712.8000000000001s)]
*  When do you think that action is triggered? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=718.8s)]
*  Seems to me, and it's a great question, Joe, that it has to relate to whether the step [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=723.68s)]
*  that was taken, one, is in response to an imminent threat to American interests, and [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=727.8399999999999s)]
*  two, whether it's an act of war. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=732.52s)]
*  And part of the reason why, after the fact, it's important for members of Congress to [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=735.4s)]
*  be able to have a briefing with the administration that is comprehensive and that gives members [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=741.8s)]
*  the opportunity to ask questions so we can provide these answers to the American people [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=747.68s)]
*  who clearly do not want another failed, costly, deadly war in the Middle East. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=752.52s)]
*  All right. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=761.04s)]
*  Leader Hakeem Jeffries, thank you so much for being with us. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=763.3599999999999s)]
*  And may I just say, as a guy who had to walk to court in 100-degree weather time and time [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=765.92s)]
*  again in Northwest Florida, the choice of seersucker today in Washington, D.C., a very [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=774.2s)]
*  wise one, sir. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=780.4s)]
*  So thank you so much for being with us. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=781.72s)]
*  That's high praise from you, Joe. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=784.0s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=785.0s)]
*  It's hot there. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=788.08s)]
*  Stay cool. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=789.08s)]
*  Stay inside. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=790.08s)]
*  Thanks so much, Leader. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=791.08s)]
*  Greatly appreciate it. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=792.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1aypxbkdBE&t=804.0s)]
