# ‘People will start dying again’: Health officials fear Trump’s cuts put opioid recovery at risk
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0)
*  New data from the CDC shows opioid overdose deaths dropped by 27% last year. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=0.0s)]
*  That's the largest one-year decline on record. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=6.28s)]
*  But a growing number of health experts worry all that progress now could be lost. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=8.9s)]
*  NBC News correspondent, co-host of News Now Daily, Morgan Radford joins us with more on [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=13.52s)]
*  that. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=18.64s)]
*  Warning, you've been covering this crisis, Morgan, for a long time. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=19.64s)]
*  So what do health officials say? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  What are they worried about right now? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=23.64s)]
*  Yeah, the simple reason? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=24.8s)]
*  Funding cuts. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=26.28s)]
*  The Trump administration has proposed more than $6 billion in funding cuts to the CDC [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=27.28s)]
*  and other agencies, which deal directly with the opioid crisis. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=31.44s)]
*  And it's not just researchers and doctors who are sounding the alarm. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=35.84s)]
*  We went to a small town called Huntington, West Virginia, where we have been covering [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=39.400000000000006s)]
*  the opioid crisis for almost a decade now to see what they had to say. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=43.2s)]
*  That was me when I was sober, actually. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=47.72s)]
*  Rebecca Queen says she's been addicted to opioids for 17 years. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=51.88s)]
*  I probably use every three to five hours. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=56.56s)]
*  But four months ago, that addiction almost cost her her life. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=59.080000000000005s)]
*  They call it death dope. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  And this is how I'm saying it. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=65.32000000000001s)]
*  And the addiction is I sought it out. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=66.64s)]
*  You sought out the death dope? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=69.32000000000001s)]
*  Death dope. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=70.88s)]
*  Dope that would be so powerful it would bring you near death. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=71.88s)]
*  Correct. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=74.4s)]
*  I had died. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=75.4s)]
*  Two Narcans brought me back. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=76.4s)]
*  Now health officials here say that Narcan, a drug also known as naloxone that works in [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=77.64s)]
*  minutes to reverse overdoses, is in jeopardy. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=83.16s)]
*  What if I told you that there are proposed government spending cuts that make it harder [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=86.44000000000001s)]
*  for you to get Narcan? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=93.84s)]
*  I think they're trying to kill us off. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=95.84s)]
*  More nuisance. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=98.88000000000001s)]
*  We're like raccoons and pigeons. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=99.88000000000001s)]
*  The Trump administration is looking to cut $56 million in annual grants that fund naloxone [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=101.72s)]
*  distribution here in Huntington, West Virginia, which attorneys for the city have called ground [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=106.76s)]
*  zero for the opioid crisis. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=111.68s)]
*  You can't even walk your kids down the road without probably stepping on a needle. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=113.72s)]
*  Local health officials are taking drastic action. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=117.52s)]
*  So this is one of the closets that we keep the Narcan. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=120.44s)]
*  So you are stocking up on Narcan right now? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=123.68s)]
*  We are gathering as much as we can. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=126.16s)]
*  In case those funding cuts come. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=127.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=129.64s)]
*  Connie Pretty leads the Huntington Quick Response Team. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=130.64s)]
*  Is this the QRT headquarters? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=132.96s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=134.44s)]
*  Which deploys to overdose calls with specialists trained to save lives and to help guide people [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=135.68s)]
*  out of addiction. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=141.6s)]
*  When is the last time someone has used Narcan to save you? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=143.07999999999998s)]
*  About an overdose. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=146.16s)]
*  About a year ago? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=147.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=148.16s)]
*  Pretty met with First Lady Melania Trump to discuss the opioid crisis in 2019, three [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=149.16s)]
*  years after our team visited Huntington when the city was overwhelmed by overdoses. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=154.4s)]
*  Now what is the bleach for? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=159.88s)]
*  To clean dirty needles. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=161.64s)]
*  We went back in 2020 during a pandemic spike. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=163.28s)]
*  This is a track mark. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=167.04s)]
*  And now the city has finally managed to get overdose calls down by more than 70% from [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=168.35999999999999s)]
*  their peak. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=173.88s)]
*  And there's a lot of people here that... [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=174.88s)]
*  A hard fought battle that Pretty fears they may have to fight again. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=176.04s)]
*  The Trump administration is looking to cut more than $6 billion to the CDC and other [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=180.92s)]
*  federal agencies that directly address the opioid crisis. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=185.62s)]
*  We're a small community. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=189.51999999999998s)]
*  The funding is just so important, I can't even tell you. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=191.2s)]
*  I wonder how you wage a war on drugs without paying for it. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=194.6s)]
*  You can't. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=197.76s)]
*  You've just got to decide are lives important enough to save? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=198.76s)]
*  Is the money more important than the good that you will do? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=203.64s)]
*  Do you think voters understand that decision? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=206.67999999999998s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=209.12s)]
*  Am I trying to stand here and say there's no government waste? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=210.28s)]
*  No. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=213.12s)]
*  But lives, saving lives is not government waste. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=214.12s)]
*  Cuts that would affect people like Silly McElfresh, who says Pretty's team saved her life after [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=217.16s)]
*  years of addiction. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=222.2s)]
*  I was on fentanyl for many years, died so many times. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=223.76s)]
*  So many times. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=230.39999999999998s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=231.39999999999998s)]
*  Take your time. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=232.39999999999998s)]
*  But I tried to go to treatment. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=234.79999999999998s)]
*  Most people did not care about me at that point. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=238.28s)]
*  Did the quick response team save you? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=241.07999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=243.0s)]
*  Multiple. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=244.0s)]
*  With Narcan? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=245.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=246.0s)]
*  Now three years sober, she uses her experience as a certified peer counselor to help others [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=247.0s)]
*  escape addiction once and for all. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=251.18s)]
*  What happens if funding goes away? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=254.22s)]
*  People start dying again. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=258.02s)]
*  People will start dying again. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=261.90000000000003s)]
*  NBC News reached out to the White House for a comment, but officials did not respond by [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=265.14s)]
*  deadline. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=269.66s)]
*  The president did sign an executive order in February aimed at disrupting the synthetic [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=270.66s)]
*  opiate supply chain from China. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=275.46000000000004s)]
*  Saving lives is not government waste. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=277.96000000000004s)]
*  That is a powerful line there. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=279.58s)]
*  Let's talk about fentanyl. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=281.90000000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump, the president, has talked about it a lot. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=283.76000000000005s)]
*  Now doing something. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=287.0s)]
*  What is it exactly? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=288.28000000000003s)]
*  He's always talking about the supply side. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=289.28000000000003s)]
*  He's always talking about stopping the influx of fentanyl from abroad. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=291.52000000000004s)]
*  When you talk to people who are doing the work, where the boots meet the ground every [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=296.40000000000003s)]
*  single day, they say, look, the supply chain isn't the total issue. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=299.96000000000004s)]
*  It may not even be the bulk of the issue. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=303.6s)]
*  People like Connie said, we got the numbers down. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=305.64000000000004s)]
*  In the last five years, we've seen this influx of fentanyl. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=308.56s)]
*  We still managed to get the numbers down, but we did that by focusing on demand. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=311.32s)]
*  The only way you can focus on demand is with those cuts, excuse me, with those government [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=315.16s)]
*  programs that are funded by federal state dollars. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=319.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=322.28000000000003s)]
*  What you hear there is a cry for help. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  We need this funding and we need it badly. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=324.84000000000003s)]
*  Please don't stop the progress that we've started to make. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=326.8s)]
*  Fascinating look at this. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=329.36s)]
*  NBC News correspondent, co-host of News Now Daily, Morgan Radford. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=330.6s)]
*  Morgan, thanks. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=334.32s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYMO_HMJh0&t=335.32s)]
