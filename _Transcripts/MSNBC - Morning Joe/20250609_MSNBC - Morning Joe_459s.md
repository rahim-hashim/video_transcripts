# Trump wants a fight, not trying to calm tensions: Senator slams president's handling of protests
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8)
*  When they spit at people, you know, they spit. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=0.0s)]
*  That's their new thing. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=3.64s)]
*  They spit, and worse, you know what? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=5.04s)]
*  They throw at them, right? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=7.3s)]
*  And when that happens, I have a little statement. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=8.3s)]
*  They say, they spit, we hit. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=11.3s)]
*  And I told them, nobody's going to spit on our police officers. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=13.98s)]
*  Nobody's going to spit on our military, which they do is a common thing. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  They get up to them this far away, and then they start spitting in their face. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=24.14s)]
*  When this happens, they get hit very hard. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=27.96s)]
*  All right, that brings us to our next conversation. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  Joining us now, Democratic Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=33.68s)]
*  Thank you very much for coming on this morning. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=37.96s)]
*  Focusing on Los Angeles and the Marines that are standing by, what's your take on where [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  this is headed? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=46.08s)]
*  Well, I think it's first important to point out that Donald Trump is just not telling [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=47.88s)]
*  the truth. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=52.8s)]
*  There's been property damage, but these are pretty isolated protests. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=54.64s)]
*  There's just no doubt that the local law enforcement can handle them. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=58.0s)]
*  And we've all listened to Donald Trump's affection for martial law. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=62.16s)]
*  We've watched him try to destroy our democracy and the rule of law over the last six months. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=66.36s)]
*  And so, of course, it's incredibly concerning to see him threatening a federal takeover [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=70.88s)]
*  here. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=76.0s)]
*  This is the first time in 60 years that you've had a president deploy the National Guard [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=77.0s)]
*  without a request of the local governor. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=80.44s)]
*  But it can also be true that everything that's happened in the last seven days between the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=83.8s)]
*  fight with Elon Musk and now the deployment of the National Guard is probably also a distraction [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=89.24s)]
*  from the main story, which is that right now, Donald Trump is trying to pass probably the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=94.83999999999999s)]
*  most unpopular piece of legislation that he will attempt to move through Congress in his [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=100.16s)]
*  first term. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=104.28s)]
*  He's going to throw 15 million people off their health care in order to fund a massive [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=105.28s)]
*  tax cut for the wealthy. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=109.60000000000001s)]
*  It's going to add two trillion dollars to our deficit. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=110.8s)]
*  We're probably going to head into a recession. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  And so I do also think he's probably doing everything he can to try to get the entire [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=114.92s)]
*  political world to be talking about anything other than a piece of legislation that's going [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  to fundamentally change this country. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=125.16s)]
*  So, yeah, we have to point out the danger of what he's proposing to do in Los Angeles [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=126.76s)]
*  while also keeping our eye on the ball, which is a bill that's going to transform our economy [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=131.4s)]
*  and ruin a lot of lives. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=138.04s)]
*  Many things can be true at the same time. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=140.6s)]
*  Having said that, people are very upset about these ICE raids in Los Angeles for these poor, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=143.0s)]
*  terrified families. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  The initial promise was that these deportations would be for criminals only. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=153.23999999999998s)]
*  That's clearly not what's happening here as they're trying to make certain numbers. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  What's your message to protesters? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=163.92s)]
*  And also, what can elected officials do at this point? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=166.84s)]
*  And your take on how Gavin Newsom is doing? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=169.76000000000002s)]
*  Well, I mean, my first message is to keep it peaceful. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=174.32s)]
*  I mean, obviously, this is a moment where we have to be on the streets all over the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=176.76000000000002s)]
*  country to protest what's happening to our immigrant community, but more broadly, to [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=179.76000000000002s)]
*  protest what's happening to our democracy. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  This is the most corrupt administration in the history of the country. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  And we are going to rise to this moment by being out there on the streets. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=190.16s)]
*  But, you know, ultimately, I think the country sees what Donald Trump is trying to do here. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=195.32s)]
*  He's looking for a fight. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=200.92000000000002s)]
*  There's nothing in what he is doing that is about peace or about restoring order. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=202.24s)]
*  He's taking a protest that is relatively isolated. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=206.96s)]
*  You know, people in Los Angeles over the weekend would tell you that 99 percent of them [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  went about their day. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=214.52s)]
*  And it was pretty normal because this is not an invasion that has taken over the entire [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=216.32s)]
*  city. And he's trying to turn a protest that is pretty small into something that involves [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=220.84s)]
*  an even bigger confrontation so that he might actually be able to invoke the Insurrection [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=226.0s)]
*  Act. That would be a defining story of the week if he were to do it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=230.16s)]
*  And I just don't think we have to make sure that we understand to not take him at his [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=236.48s)]
*  word. He's looking for a fight. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=240.79999999999998s)]
*  He's not trying to calm tensions. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=242.2s)]
*  Senator, we'll turn to the bill in just a moment. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=244.2s)]
*  One last beat on this. Is there any peril you see for Democrats, though, to be [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=246.0s)]
*  dismissive of what is happening there? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=250.76s)]
*  If there is an image of a burning car, let's say if there is some violence, even if it's [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=252.84s)]
*  isolated, what are the political risks here? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=256.59999999999997s)]
*  How do you talk about that? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=259.56s)]
*  Well, listen, I think you make it clear that we only are for peaceful protest. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=263.0s)]
*  But I don't think the American public wants martial law. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=267.71999999999997s)]
*  I think the American public knows that local law enforcement can handle these protests. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=272.48s)]
*  You know, what we also have to talk about is that Donald Trump only cares about protests [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=277.44s)]
*  when they're opposing him. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=281.64s)]
*  I mean, every single day we should be reminding the American public that there were [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=284.08s)]
*  protesters at the Capitol fighting for Donald Trump to install him in power permanently [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=287.56s)]
*  on January 6th of 2021, who beat the hell out of police officers with metal poles and [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=292.52s)]
*  tasers and are out on the street today. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=298.8s)]
*  So Donald Trump only cares about quelling violent protests or quelling protests at large [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=301.2s)]
*  when it's protest against him. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=306.72s)]
*  That's fundamentally undemocratic. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=308.12s)]
*  And it's frankly an invitation for more violence on the streets. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=310.52s)]
*  The message is simply if you're violent in service of a Republican cause, you'll get [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=314.32s)]
*  a get out of jail free card. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=319.12s)]
*  But if you're engaged in protest against the administration, well, then we're sending [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=320.72s)]
*  in the National Guard. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=325.12s)]
*  So Senator, you were just on Twitter a few moments ago suggesting that, look, you got [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=326.32s)]
*  to be able to do things at once to talk about this. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=329.68s)]
*  But keep your eye on the ball. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=331.28s)]
*  In your estimation, that is indeed the legislation that's now in the Senate. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=332.48s)]
*  Give us a sense as to what you see. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=336.92s)]
*  And also, what you're hearing from your Republican colleagues there, who a week or so [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=338.56s)]
*  back as it was finishing up in the House, made clear they had some reservations. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=342.92s)]
*  Well, of course they have reservations. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=348.96000000000004s)]
*  This is a bill that will ruin people's lives all across the country. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=350.68s)]
*  You're talking, as I mentioned, about a bill that would throw 15 million people off of [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=354.96000000000004s)]
*  their health care. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=360.84s)]
*  And for what? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=362.0s)]
*  In order to fund a new massive tax cut for the wealthy and corporations, the richest [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=363.08s)]
*  Americans would get reportedly a two hundred and seventy thousand dollar tax cut from [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=368.23999999999995s)]
*  this bill. And the bill would actually make 40 percent of the American public poorer [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=373.52s)]
*  because the tax cuts for the poor in the middle class are like table scraps. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=378.32s)]
*  But they'd lose their nutrition benefits for their kids. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=382.35999999999996s)]
*  They'd lose their health care. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=384.59999999999997s)]
*  They lose a whole bunch of services. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=386.32s)]
*  Yes, I think Republicans are taking a look at this and wondering whether they can [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=388.24s)]
*  survive reelection. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=391.76s)]
*  And so there is a chance that we can get the four votes in the Senate we need to stop [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=394.04s)]
*  this abomination of a bill. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=399.96s)]
*  But it does require us talking about it. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=401.76s)]
*  There was a CBS poll in the last week that suggested only about 30 percent of Americans [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=404.2s)]
*  know that there's a piece of legislation in front of the Congress that would do this [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=408.71999999999997s)]
*  much damage to the economy. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=411.71999999999997s)]
*  So that makes sense. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=413.08s)]
*  Donald Trump's going to distract you with a fight with Elon Musk. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=414.48s)]
*  He's going to distract you with National Guard troops because he knows that if only 30 [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=417.28000000000003s)]
*  or 40 percent of the American public know that he's about to throw 15 million people [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=421.68s)]
*  off of their health care, working families, then maybe Republicans won't be under the [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=427.08s)]
*  kind of pressure that they should be under to stop it. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=431.32s)]
*  Democratic Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, thank you, Senator, for joining us this [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=434.76s)]
*  morning. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iumfo8ZKn8&t=438.2s)]
