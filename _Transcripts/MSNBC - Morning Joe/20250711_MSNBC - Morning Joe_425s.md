# 'Incredibly cynical': Governor shreds Trump law for potential to cause 138,000 to lose Medicaid
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [July 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE)
*  Governors across the country are rushing to determine how President Trump's spending [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=0.0s)]
*  law will impact their own states. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=5.12s)]
*  For instance, in Connecticut, the Congressional Budget Office estimates about 138,000 residents [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=8.08s)]
*  there could lose Medicaid coverage as a result of the legislation. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=14.64s)]
*  Joining us now, Connecticut's Democratic Governor, Ned Lamont. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=19.88s)]
*  Good to have you back on the show, Governor. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=24.52s)]
*  Governor, thank you so much for being with us. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=26.0s)]
*  I'm so concerned, Governor, you look at the people that are going to be impacted. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=29.52s)]
*  Now, that number, the low end is 138,000. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=33.72s)]
*  The high end goes up to about 175,000 people in Connecticut. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=36.68s)]
*  Families could lose health care coverage because of this bill. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=41.36s)]
*  I'm also concerned, and I want you to know, I want you to tell us, like for instance, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=44.76s)]
*  let's say for vets who are 100% disabled, you know, they could lose SNAP coverage. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=49.84s)]
*  There are a lot of veterans that are saying they're not going to be able to afford groceries [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=57.6s)]
*  after serving this country honorably, having honorable discharges and having 100% disability. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=62.36s)]
*  I mean, talk about what's the impact of this bill on veterans and others in Connecticut [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=70.56s)]
*  who are going to possibly lose their health coverage and also lose critical food assistance. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  Hey, good morning, guys. It's incredibly cynical, this bill. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=87.56s)]
*  You know, I thought that Trump was going to go after waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=90.8s)]
*  No, he's just shoving these things onto the backs of the states. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  And then, as you point out, 100,000 people could lose health insurance. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=97.76s)]
*  How does that accomplish? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=103.04s)]
*  Today, they cut $50 million out of after-school programs for our kids in our poorer cities. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=104.28s)]
*  Is that waste, fraud, abuse? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=109.68s)]
*  They're taking fresh produce off the shelves of our food share, our food bank. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=111.4s)]
*  This is an incredibly cynical enterprise. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=116.16s)]
*  At the same time they're doing that, they're jacking up the deficit by $3, 4, 5 trillion. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=118.4s)]
*  Yeah. Tell me about the impact. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=126.04s)]
*  Let's just really drill down here and talk about who this is going to impact. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=129.95999999999998s)]
*  And when. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=137.51999999999998s)]
*  In your home state. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=138.16s)]
*  Like, what health care services are going to be taken away from residents of Connecticut and every other state? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=140.27999999999997s)]
*  Starting almost immediately, Joe, we have tens of thousands of people who get expanded Medicaid. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=148.39999999999998s)]
*  That's at risk right now. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=154.76s)]
*  Something we call Covered Connecticut. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=156.72s)]
*  We're proud. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=158.32s)]
*  We have more of our people insured than just about any state in the country. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=159.28s)]
*  That's a good thing. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=162.44s)]
*  I want everybody to be insured. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  As I mentioned, why are you going after our schools? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=166.04000000000002s)]
*  Why are you going after daycare? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=168.4s)]
*  We have an electronic portal. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=170.24s)]
*  That's how you get paid. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=171.56s)]
*  All of a sudden you wake up one day and the portal is shut down. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=172.68s)]
*  Governor, we were talking about rural hospitals and the potential closure of them across the country. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=177.68s)]
*  Some in Connecticut as well. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=183.12s)]
*  But also, let's talk about some of these urban health care centers, community health care centers in a city. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=184.4s)]
*  Like Hartford. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=189.23999999999998s)]
*  I was reading a piece just yesterday about one that says we are reimbursed almost entirely by Medicaid. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=190.11999999999998s)]
*  We already operate on a shoestring budget. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=195.76s)]
*  This is the place because we pay, we take care of people regardless of their ability to pay. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=198.11999999999998s)]
*  This is the hospital in this community and we may have to shut our doors or cut back staff and services. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=204.44s)]
*  So what would be the impact there in terms of health care in Connecticut? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=211.12s)]
*  Look, Medicaid is directly impacting our urban hospitals, where a lot of our poor folks are, and our rural hospitals. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=215.92s)]
*  You know, I tried to work with red state governors and said, hey, come on. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=223.04s)]
*  This Medicaid is going to hurt you even worse with your rural hospitals. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=226.44s)]
*  But they got $50 billion for their hospitals. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=229.76s)]
*  We in the blue states are sort of on our own. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=232.56s)]
*  But cutting back on health care doesn't solve anything. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=234.92s)]
*  It means people wait and get sick, then they go into the emergency room, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=237.88s)]
*  and then we all pay for what they call uncompensated care, which is hospitals have to get reimbursed for the money they're spending. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=241.68s)]
*  So, Peter Baker, this connects to our earlier conversation, right, about how so much of the next handful of months, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=249.48s)]
*  maybe even year and a half, is politically is going to be dictated by how both parties message this bill and its effects on on voters. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=254.32s)]
*  And we we've heard some in the govsey, some in the Senate have expressed concerns even after many of them voted for it anyway. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=264.16s)]
*  Now we have a Democratic governor saying, hey, this is how it's going to impact my state. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=270.52000000000004s)]
*  What's your sense of how Republican governors might have to handle this? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=274.56s)]
*  Because so many of these cuts are going to fall on the backs of their own constituents, many of whom voted for President Trump. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=278.56s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that's the interesting thing, right, is that President Trump kind of scrambled the electoral calculations of old. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=286.20000000000005s)]
*  In fact, he brought over to his side of the political equation a lot of people who now depend on Medicaid, who depend on SNAP benefits. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=291.96s)]
*  It's a different coalition politically than Republicans are used to. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=301.15999999999997s)]
*  So what they're going to see in their states, the Republican governors are people who normally might not be, you know, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=305.4s)]
*  what have been affected in the past are going to be affected this time. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=312.64s)]
*  And they're going to have to figure out ways to either kind of fill that need or, you know, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=315.32s)]
*  find a way to explain away why this decision was made this way. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=320.08s)]
*  And it's it's that's why you didn't see a lot of Republican governors out there clamoring for this bill. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=323.35999999999996s)]
*  I didn't see many Republican governors saying this is something that they wanted at all. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=327.88s)]
*  I think that the it reminds us that that the working class people who have supported President Trump are now going to see, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=332.47999999999996s)]
*  you know, the consequences of some of the policies he's put in place and he's got to convince them that it was right. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=340.03999999999996s)]
*  Even if they're affected. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=344.92s)]
*  Yeah. So so so let me ask you, Governor, what what can you do? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=347.92s)]
*  What can the Connecticut legislature do to provide a safety net that's been taken away from so many working and middle class Americans? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=352.72s)]
*  Well, Joe, we've set aside about four billion dollars. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=362.48s)]
*  We call it a rainy day fund. It's there to protect people. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=366.16s)]
*  Usually in the case of a recession, so we don't have to raise taxes or cut education spending. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=369.84000000000003s)]
*  My instinct is we'll use some of that. I can't use much of it. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=374.88s)]
*  I use some of that to help the most vulnerable, you know, especially when it comes to people getting kicked off of Medicaid, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=377.6s)]
*  when it comes to some of our schools that need that support because it's being yanked almost overnight. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=383.2s)]
*  Wow. Democratic governor of Connecticut, Ned Lamont, thank you very much for coming on the show this morning. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=389.08s)]
*  Governor, we appreciate it. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBrJX1RybE&t=396.12s)]
