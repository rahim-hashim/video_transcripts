# Ukraine has cards and they are long term cards, says senator after meeting with Zelenskyy
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI)
*  All right, now let's get to the very latest in Ukraine. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=0.0s)]
*  Delegations from Ukraine and Russia met in Turkey yesterday for the second time in a [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=3.0s)]
*  month to discuss peace negotiations, but left without a major breakthrough. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=8.68s)]
*  Their meeting lasted barely an hour. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=14.36s)]
*  Citing Russian media, Reuters reports that Moscow put forward terms that would see Ukraine [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=17.76s)]
*  surrender large chunks of its territory and accept restrictions on the size of its army [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=24.12s)]
*  in the future. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  Kiev has repeatedly said those terms are unacceptable. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=31.400000000000002s)]
*  Ukraine's defense minister, who led his country's delegations, said he believes only a meeting [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=36.2s)]
*  between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin can effectively [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=40.36s)]
*  settle the major areas of dispute. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=47.08s)]
*  Russia and Ukraine did agree to another prisoner swap, however, which will focus on the youngest [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=51.04s)]
*  and most severely injured soldiers. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=56.64s)]
*  Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently hosted Republican Senator Lindsey [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=60.6s)]
*  Graham of South Carolina and Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut for talks [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=65.92s)]
*  in Kiev. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=72.24s)]
*  The meeting happened just days before Ukraine launched that series of drone attacks targeting [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=73.56s)]
*  Russian warplanes. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=80.39999999999999s)]
*  And Senator Blumenthal joins us now. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=82.08s)]
*  He's a member of the Homeland Security Armed Services and Judiciary Committees. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=84.27999999999999s)]
*  Also with us, the host of Way Too Early, Ali Vatali. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=90.72s)]
*  Good to have you. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=93.88s)]
*  So, Senator, tell us what your takeaway was from your trip, especially given the fact [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=94.88s)]
*  that it was just before this massive drone attack and the status of the talks between [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=99.72s)]
*  Russia and Ukraine. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=106.24s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Mika. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=108.91999999999999s)]
*  It's always uplifting and inspiring to spend time with Volodymyr Zelensky, my seventh trip [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=110.2s)]
*  to Ukraine, most of them with Senator Graham. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=118.03999999999999s)]
*  But I've met with him on numerous other occasions. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=123.28s)]
*  And sadly, one of my main takeaways was that peace, even a ceasefire, are nowhere in sight. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=125.88s)]
*  Obviously, Putin is launching, even as we speak, a major offensive, mobilizing forces [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=135.16s)]
*  in the east, Donetsk and Luhansk and other territories. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=144.8s)]
*  But the Istanbul proposal that he made yesterday shows how unserious he is about peace talks. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=149.12s)]
*  He's mocking Trump, playing him. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=156.48s)]
*  And my visit to Ukraine confirmed for me that that country is in it for the long run. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=160.67999999999998s)]
*  They're planning for the future. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=169.2s)]
*  They've pioneered and championed the revolution of ground warfare through the use of drones. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=171.51999999999998s)]
*  They're ahead of the United States, which produced 100,000 last year. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=177.88s)]
*  Ukraine will produce 4.5 million of these small drones. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=184.44s)]
*  I've visited the plants where they do make them. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=187.32s)]
*  But I also had a chance to see the sites in Ukraine that have been bombed. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=190.20000000000002s)]
*  Putin has escalated his attack on civilians to a order of magnitude that is just brutal [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=196.04000000000002s)]
*  beyond words. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=203.28s)]
*  Whole neighborhoods destroyed. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=204.28s)]
*  And so he's going to retaliate, probably, again, in response to this attack on his airfield. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=206.3s)]
*  But the combination of the attacks in the east, the offensive there, and the attacks [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=212.88s)]
*  on civilian populations are in no way deterring the people of Ukraine or Zelensky. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=219.88s)]
*  They are absolutely determined. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=226.18s)]
*  And Trump may have told them they have no cards, but they beg to differ. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=228.28s)]
*  They have cards, and they're long-term cards. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=233.16s)]
*  18 months is what it took to plan this attack on the airfield. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=235.4s)]
*  And they have other measures in the works. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=240.26s)]
*  Senator, good morning. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=242.62s)]
*  I'm curious if President Zelensky told you any more about that breathtaking attack where [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=243.62s)]
*  they smuggled all those drones in onto trucks. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=247.73999999999998s)]
*  The tops of the trucks came off, and they went and attacked those bombers. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=250.54s)]
*  If you can shed any more light on that, and more broadly, how unserious President Zelensky [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=253.34s)]
*  must think Russia is about peace, given what was offered in Istanbul, which is give us [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=258.3s)]
*  a bunch more of your country and also limit the size of your army Ukraine going forward. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=263.9s)]
*  How is he viewing these negotiations with Russia? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=269.46000000000004s)]
*  Even before yesterday, there was intelligence about what Putin was going to offer, which [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=273.22s)]
*  is, in essence, more of the same. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=278.3s)]
*  Disarm Ukraine, new elections to displace Zelensky, secession of territory, no security [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=281.98s)]
*  guarantee. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=291.66s)]
*  It's what Putin has called eliminating the root causes of the conflict. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=293.14s)]
*  And it's just totally mocking the people who think peace is possible with Putin at this [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=298.74s)]
*  point. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=307.74s)]
*  But he indicated nothing. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=308.94s)]
*  And I mean not a hint of what was to come. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=311.38s)]
*  And that is one of, I think, the very noteworthy aspects of that attack that nobody knew about [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=315.26s)]
*  despite the very substantial amount of planning and preparation that had to go into it. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=322.98s)]
*  Zelensky sat in the Oval Office with Donald Trump as the president demeaned him and insulted [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=329.1s)]
*  him by saying he had no cards and kept secret these plans. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=338.1s)]
*  I think it will go down with the United States Osama bin Laden raid and the Israeli pager [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=343.46000000000004s)]
*  One of the great special operation maneuvers of all history. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=350.98s)]
*  And the more we learn about it, the more incredible it seems. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=356.5s)]
*  But he kept it under wraps from everyone, including many in the Ukrainian government [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=360.44s)]
*  itself. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=367.1s)]
*  Senator, you got a chance to see what's happening firsthand there on the ground. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=368.1s)]
*  Now, of course, you're coming back to Washington and there are some actions that you are involved [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=372.14000000000004s)]
*  in that the Senate might take up, specifically that bipartisan sanctions package there that [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=376.22s)]
*  would make it very costly to do oil and gas business with the Russians. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=380.54s)]
*  We heard from leader Thune yesterday that he could see that move this month. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=385.42s)]
*  What's your expectation of how that will fare in the Senate where it has wide bar partisan [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=389.46000000000004s)]
*  support, but then the House as well? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=393.34000000000003s)]
*  Good question, Ali. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=396.02000000000004s)]
*  It's crunch time in Ukraine, but it's also a pivotal moment here in Washington. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=397.38000000000005s)]
*  Our sanctions bill would make a tremendous difference in stopping the flow of revenue [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=403.18s)]
*  to Putin's war machine. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=409.82s)]
*  Five hundred percent tariffs on any country buying energy products, oil and gas from Russia [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=411.82s)]
*  would target India and China. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=417.58s)]
*  They buy 70 percent of it. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=419.46s)]
*  And the message to China would be we are choking off the revenue flow. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=421.38s)]
*  We're putting Putin's economy on a trade island. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=425.9s)]
*  And if you continue to support that war machine, you will do no business with the United States [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=430.82000000000005s)]
*  or Europe. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=437.74s)]
*  And the reaction and support in Europe is absolutely astonishing. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=438.74s)]
*  We spoke to President Macron when we were in Paris, and he is 100 percent on board. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=443.98s)]
*  Germany is as well, which is significant because you'll remember that Europe used to buy a [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=450.34000000000003s)]
*  lot of oil and gas from Russia. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=454.94000000000005s)]
*  It has weaned itself away from it, and that support is critical. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=457.42s)]
*  And of course, President Zelensky believes that these sanctions are a critical source [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=461.58000000000004s)]
*  of support, along with more air defense, which he needs desperately to fend off the rain [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=466.7s)]
*  of terror from the skies that Putin is imposing on his people. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=472.02000000000004s)]
*  And I also want to say, Ali, that while I was there, I visited for the first time with [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=476.38s)]
*  some of the kidnapped children. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=481.34000000000003s)]
*  And I will tell you, my heart was in my throat. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=483.82s)]
*  There are tears in my eyes now as I think about those children who were abducted, 20,000 [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=487.26s)]
*  of them, 20,000 of them still in Russia, taken from their families by Russian soldiers who [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=493.46s)]
*  called them orphans because their parents were either shot or imprisoned. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=501.74s)]
*  They became orphans. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=507.98s)]
*  And I met with two of them about that experience. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=510.3s)]
*  And the trauma and the pain are going to be with them, I'm afraid, for their whole lives. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=513.78s)]
*  So, Senator, let me ask Joe Scarborough here. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=519.8199999999999s)]
*  Let me ask you, are Republicans going to stand up and defend those children? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=523.06s)]
*  Are Republicans going to stand up for the people of Ukraine who continue to get indiscriminately [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=528.8199999999999s)]
*  killed by Russian missiles? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=536.66s)]
*  Are Republicans that you're with, when the time comes, will they stand up to Vladimir [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=540.26s)]
*  Putin, do what's right, and pass a sanctions bill that you and Lindsey Graham have put [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=546.4599999999999s)]
*  together? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=552.26s)]
*  Will they push it to the floor and get a vote on it? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=553.26s)]
*  Key question, Joe. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=557.14s)]
*  I'm very encouraged. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=559.66s)]
*  What's your best guess? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=560.66s)]
*  My best guess is yes. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=562.4599999999999s)]
*  My best guess is probably 75% yes. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=564.42s)]
*  And here's the reason. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=569.34s)]
*  First of all, Speaker Johnson yesterday said he was in favor of sanctions. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=570.34s)]
*  Very good sign, because he wouldn't say it if the White House were telling him that [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=575.9s)]
*  it would oppose it, which I think is the critical fact. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=580.74s)]
*  The White House can stay neutral, it can stay hands-off, and Republicans will stand up to [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=584.02s)]
*  Putin. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=590.54s)]
*  Also, remember, in the United States Senate, we have 82 cosponsors, and we will be adding [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=591.54s)]
*  more. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=597.86s)]
*  Lindsey Graham and I have worked tremendously hard to build this coalition, 41 Democrats, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=598.86s)]
*  41 Republicans. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=604.1s)]
*  And Donald Trump himself has mentioned sanctions as a potential remedy. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=606.06s)]
*  The mystery to me is why Donald Trump is taking these insults, the degradation of Putin, in [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=610.54s)]
*  effect, playing him in this very overt and demeaning way. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=619.54s)]
*  So I am hopeful that Putin's continued resistance to any kind of serious ceasefire proposals. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=625.22s)]
*  Zelensky's done everything, literally everything Trump has asked him to do. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=632.86s)]
*  He's come to the table, he is ready to do a ceasefire, and of course, it's in his interest [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=637.5s)]
*  because his people are being murdered by the missiles and drones. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=642.5s)]
*  But he has come around to do what Trump wants him to do. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=647.58s)]
*  So I think, yes, Republicans will stand up as long as they're given a chance to vote. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=651.98s)]
*  All we need is a vote. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=656.86s)]
*  We have 82 cosponsors in the Senate, which is a super veto-proof majority, and I believe [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=658.4200000000001s)]
*  they'll stand up. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=666.22s)]
*  Well, and if Mike Johnson is saying in the House that he supports the sanctions, and [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=667.62s)]
*  that is Donald Trump basically giving him the go-ahead because he would never do it [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=672.86s)]
*  unless he didn't. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=676.98s)]
*  That's, of course, most likely his response to Vladimir Putin. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=677.98s)]
*  Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, always good to see you. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=682.98s)]
*  Thank you very much for coming on the show this morning. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-BmGVyXrRI&t=686.22s)]
