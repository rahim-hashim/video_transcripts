# Trump's extreme Jan. 6 apologist pick for watchdog role won't end well: Barbara McQuade
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs)
*  New opinion piece, MSNBC.com, is highlighting President Trump's recent pick of a vocal January [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=0.0s)]
*  6th apologist for a key watchdog role. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=6.24s)]
*  The author of the piece, Barbara McQuade, predicts that decision will not end well. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=8.96s)]
*  Barbara writes this, quote, picking Paul Ingracia to lead the U.S. Office of Special Council [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=13.16s)]
*  is not like putting the fox in charge of the hen house. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  It's more like setting fire to the whole farm. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=21.2s)]
*  His views on the January 6th riot are extreme, even by MAGA standards. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=23.56s)]
*  In December, Ingracia called for not only pardons of the January 6th defendants, but [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=28.12s)]
*  also for $1 million per family in reparations. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=32.660000000000004s)]
*  He advocated for Trump to expressly name in a public proclamation any judge and prosecutor [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=37.36s)]
*  involved in the J-6 scam, his words, and call on them to resign from their offices and pressure [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=42.74s)]
*  Congress to undertake impeachment proceedings against them if they do not cooperate. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=48.66s)]
*  Ingracia also urged Congress to make January 6th a national holiday to place the day's [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=53.72s)]
*  events in their proper historical context, he wrote, as a peaceful protest against a [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=59.2s)]
*  great injustice affecting our electoral system. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=64.68s)]
*  Again, those are all the words of Mr. Ingracia. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=67.52s)]
*  And Barbara joins us now. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=70.32s)]
*  She's an MSNBC contributor, former U.S. attorney, her New York Times bestseller, Attack From [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=71.56s)]
*  Within, How Disinformation is Sabotaging America, a huge hit, now out in paperback. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=76.68s)]
*  Barb, great to see you. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=82.68s)]
*  I want to talk a little bit more about the book in a minute, but can you tell us more [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=83.68s)]
*  about Paul Ingracia, his experience, who he is, and how he got to the doorstep of this [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=86.68s)]
*  key role? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=92.48s)]
*  Well, this is a man who graduated from law school three years ago. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=93.48s)]
*  He has worked at the Claremont Institute as a research fellow, and he has been a Trump [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=97.4s)]
*  loyalist since the term began. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=103.0s)]
*  He first started as the White House liaison at the Department of Justice. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=104.72s)]
*  He ruffled feathers there, even with the very pro-Trump leadership they have there, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=109.6s)]
*  and moved recently to be the liaison to the Department of Homeland Security. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=114.03999999999999s)]
*  But one of the things that's so disturbing to me about this appointment, you know, certainly [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=118.0s)]
*  they're political loyalists throughout any administration, but the Office of Special [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=121.8s)]
*  Counsel is the federal agency that is created post-Watergate to ensure that there are not [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=125.8s)]
*  politics in the federal workplace. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=132.2s)]
*  This is the agency that protects whistleblowers and enforces prohibited personnel practices [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=135.12s)]
*  so that employees are insulated from politics when they work in the federal workforce. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=141.88s)]
*  It is, in my view, the absolute worst possible kind of match between a person and a professional [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=146.92000000000002s)]
*  responsibility. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=155.64000000000001s)]
*  So a 30-year-old three years out of law school gets this huge job in the government. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  What are your specific concerns about what he may or may not do in that role? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=161.0s)]
*  So if you have a problem in the federal workforce, a federal employee, you want to be a whistleblower [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=165.52s)]
*  about fraud, waste, or abuse in your agency, this is where you go. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=172.24s)]
*  If you are an employee and you're concerned that people are engaging in politics on taxpayer [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=176.16s)]
*  dollars, you would complain to the head of the Office of Special Counsel. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=182.12s)]
*  If you have someone there who is a loyal Trump supporter more than they care about [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=186.78s)]
*  the professional workplace, those complaints are going to fall on deaf ears. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=192.16s)]
*  And in fact, I think whistleblowers are going to be concerned that if they raise the issue [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=197.14s)]
*  and it is something that would be opposed to the president's agenda, it will fall on [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=202.3s)]
*  deaf ears or maybe even bring retaliation to them. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=206.66s)]
*  You probably saw recently that there's this new questionnaire that federal employees have [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=209.94s)]
*  to respond to when onboarding about what's your favorite executive order and why and [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=214.58s)]
*  how are you going to execute it. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=219.46s)]
*  I worry that our federal workforce, which for more than 100 years has promoted professionalism, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=221.34s)]
*  people who can do these jobs based on competence, will instead be turned into just one more [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=226.9s)]
*  political arm of the Trump administration. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkU6-kzjwxs&t=231.54000000000002s)]
