# 'Not a smart guy': Trump rails against 'stupid person' Fed chair while calling for rate cut
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U)
*  Now, want to stay with it for one more beat? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's see what he has to say. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=3.12s)]
*  We're listening in now. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=5.84s)]
*  President Trump with the White House line. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  A little before that, just a tad. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  And I've always said, why doesn't it have a flagpole [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=10.84s)]
*  from the grass? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=13.96s)]
*  They go to flagpole from the grass. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=14.56s)]
*  They have a little one on top, a very little one. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=15.92s)]
*  This is about the largest you'll ever see. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=18.64s)]
*  And it's tapered. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=23.28s)]
*  It's an equality that you guys rarely get to even put up. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=24.88s)]
*  They do that for a living. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=28.52s)]
*  They're incredible people. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=30.12s)]
*  I don't know them, but I love them. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=31.76s)]
*  And I would bet that they all voted for Trump. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=34.32s)]
*  I mean, I don't know for a fact, but I think so. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=36.44s)]
*  But we're about to lift it. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=39.28s)]
*  And we also have one going on what's [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=40.88s)]
*  called the front or the north. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  We have one going there, identical. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=44.32s)]
*  So we'll have one on this side of the building. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=46.6s)]
*  We'll have one on that side of the building properly placed. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  In this case, we had a lot of choices putting it on that hill, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=52.0s)]
*  putting it different places. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=54.68s)]
*  It's such a beautiful pole. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=56.68s)]
*  We thought we'd put it near. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=57.76s)]
*  I mean, it always looks best when it's near. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=58.84s)]
*  A derail, I put it right near. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=62.0s)]
*  I have a similar pole. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=63.24s)]
*  And these are the best poles anywhere in the country, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=65.56s)]
*  or in the world, actually. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=68.8s)]
*  They're tapered. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=70.56s)]
*  They have the nice top. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=72.24s)]
*  I don't know if you people are aesthetic. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=75.0s)]
*  You know, they're the fake news. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=76.92s)]
*  I don't know if I'm. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  I don't know if they are. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=79.44s)]
*  But it's a very exciting project to me. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=80.16s)]
*  And then at 11 o'clock, we're lifting the flag. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  But we're going to lift the pole now. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=84.92s)]
*  And then they're going to the other side, get that. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=86.28s)]
*  And then we're going to do, I think, two flag liftings. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=88.04s)]
*  We'll be putting it up at 11 on here. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=90.44s)]
*  And a couple of minutes later on the other side, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  we'll start here at 11. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=94.88s)]
*  So that'll be very nice. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=96.68s)]
*  They're very patriotic. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  We're doing well as a country. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=98.84s)]
*  If the Fed would ever lower rates, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=100.92s)]
*  you know, we'd buy debt for a lot less. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=102.72s)]
*  It's a shame. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=105.32s)]
*  This guy, I have a guy. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=105.8s)]
*  Do you ever have a guy that's not a smart person, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=106.68s)]
*  and you're dealing with him, and you have to deal? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=108.8s)]
*  He's not a smart guy. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=110.8s)]
*  He's worried about inflation. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=111.84s)]
*  I said, that's right. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=113.08s)]
*  If there's inflation in six months or nine months, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=113.76s)]
*  you lower the rates or you raise the rates. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=115.92s)]
*  You can do whatever you want, Brian, right? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=118.2s)]
*  So let's say there's rampant inflation, which there's none. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=120.48s)]
*  You know, there is a success. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=123.88s)]
*  I got a call from Congress last night, sir, there's a problem. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=126.04s)]
*  I said, what is it? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=128.96s)]
*  Money is pouring in. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=130.16s)]
*  We don't know how to account for it. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=131.2s)]
*  I said, check the tariffs. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=133.24s)]
*  $88 billion came in from tariffs. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=135.0s)]
*  No inflation. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=137.4s)]
*  And it's going to get even more so. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=138.92000000000002s)]
*  I know what I'm doing. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=141.4s)]
*  So we have a stupid person, frankly, at the Fed. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  He probably won't cut today. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=145.68s)]
*  Europe had 10 cuts, and we had none. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=147.36s)]
*  And I guess he's a political guy. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=151.36s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=152.96s)]
*  He's a political guy who's not a smart person. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=153.48000000000002s)]
*  But he's costing the country a fortune. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=156.20000000000002s)]
*  So what I'm going to do is, you know, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=158.52s)]
*  he gets out in about nine months. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=160.8s)]
*  He gets fortunately terminated. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=162.72s)]
*  I would have never reappointed him. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=165.64000000000001s)]
*  Biden reappointed him. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=166.96s)]
*  I don't know why that is, but I guess maybe he was a Democrat. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=168.0s)]
*  You know, I got great advice from Mnuchin on this one. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=171.24s)]
*  Great advice. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=174.16s)]
*  But he's done a poor job. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=175.96s)]
*  So we have no inflation. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=178.44s)]
*  We have only success. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  And I'd like to see interest rates get down. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=181.76s)]
*  Now, Biden did a lot of very short-term debt. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=183.6s)]
*  So we have short-term debt coming to him. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=187.44s)]
*  And because of this guy's rates, you know, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=189.76s)]
*  if he'd lowered a point, I'd pay about a point less. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=192.56s)]
*  Then if he'd lowered two points, I'd pay about two points less. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=195.56s)]
*  And that's for 10 years, 12 years, 15 years, five years. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=199.04000000000002s)]
*  It's hundreds of billions. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=203.2s)]
*  It's even trillions of dollars that we're going to lose [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=205.48s)]
*  because of this too late. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=208.76s)]
*  I call him too late pal because he's always too late. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=210.48s)]
*  I mean, if you look at him, every time I did this, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=213.16s)]
*  I was right 100 percent. He was wrong. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=215.44s)]
*  Maybe I should go to the Fed. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=218.12s)]
*  Am I allowed to appoint myself, Doug? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=219.84s)]
*  I don't know. Am I allowed to appoint myself at the Fed? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=221.44s)]
*  I'd do a much better job than these people. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=224.04s)]
*  So anyway, we should be two points lower. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=226.72s)]
*  It'd be nice to be two and a half points lower. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=228.8s)]
*  We'd be saving $800 billion, $700 billion. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=231.12s)]
*  That's a lot of money. Thank you. For nothing. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=236.32s)]
*  For absolutely nothing. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=239.08s)]
*  We'd save six, seven, $800 billion. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=240.56s)]
*  We have, I think we're 38th now in interest, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=244.92000000000002s)]
*  and we should be number one. We should be the lowest. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=248.12s)]
*  But, and by the way, if he's worried about inflation, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=251.08s)]
*  that's okay. I understand that. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=253.88s)]
*  I don't think there's going to be any. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=255.76s)]
*  So far there hasn't. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=256.88s)]
*  I mean, we have almost no inflation. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=258.24s)]
*  We've done a great job. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=259.76s)]
*  We had, when I came in, we had a lot of inflation. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=261.36s)]
*  We went through four years of the highest inflation [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=264.28s)]
*  in the history of our country with Sleepy Joe Biden. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=266.84s)]
*  And Sleepy Joe, and he didn't know what the hell he was doing. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=270.88s)]
*  And so we had the highest inflation [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=275.56s)]
*  we've ever had in the history of our country. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=278.76s)]
*  And then it came down because when I got elected, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=281.76s)]
*  it started dropping because people understood [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=283.76s)]
*  that I knew what I was doing. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=285.59999999999997s)]
*  But now we have a man that just refuses to lower the Fed rate, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=287.36s)]
*  just refuses to do it. And he's not a smart person. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=291.52000000000004s)]
*  I don't even think he's that political. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=295.8s)]
*  I think he hates me, but that's okay. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=297.08000000000004s)]
*  You know, he should. He should. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=298.56s)]
*  I call him every name in the book, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=300.32s)]
*  trying to get him to do something. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=301.56s)]
*  I've been nice to him. I do it always. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=302.84000000000003s)]
*  I don't know how to sell. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=304.8s)]
*  I've been so nice to him, fellas, you wouldn't believe. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=306.08000000000004s)]
*  Let's have dinner. Too late. I'd call him too late. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=308.08000000000004s)]
*  Come on, too late. Let's have dinner. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=311.68s)]
*  I do it every way in the book. I'm nasty. I'm nice. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=313.56s)]
*  Nothing works. He's like just a stupid person. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=316.56s)]
*  But I don't expect anything. Maybe he does a little bit. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=320.48s)]
*  But we should be two and a half points. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=323.48s)]
*  Remember, Europe had 10 cuts. We had none. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=325.56s)]
*  We're paying more rate, more interest [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=329.64000000000004s)]
*  than a lot of European nations that can't carry our suitcase. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=331.76000000000005s)]
*  I'm going to be nice. It's another expression. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=337.08000000000004s)]
*  You know what the other expression can't carry. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=339.48s)]
*  You know what it is. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=341.32000000000005s)]
*  But I shouldn't use it in front of the fake news. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=342.40000000000003s)]
*  So it's very sad to see it. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=345.12s)]
*  And what I'm going to do is I'm going to go very short. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=346.64000000000004s)]
*  President Trump first with some lots of thoughts about flagpoles, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=349.6s)]
*  now attacking Fed chair Jerome Powell [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=352.44s)]
*  while standing on the White House lawn [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=355.32s)]
*  looking for interest rate cuts. Let's keep listening. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=356.72s)]
*  We have to give him this appetite for our debt [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=358.52000000000004s)]
*  because our country is doing well. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=360.40000000000003s)]
*  But think of it. I got a call from Congress three nights ago. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=361.76s)]
*  Sir, we can't account for the money coming in. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=365.08000000000004s)]
*  I said, that's a good problem. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=367.88s)]
*  You know, the bad problem is we don't have any money. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=369.28000000000003s)]
*  They can't account. There's so much more money [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=372.16s)]
*  than we thought is coming into the Treasury. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=374.04s)]
*  We don't know where it's coming from, sir. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=377.12s)]
*  I said, check out the tariffs. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=379.16s)]
*  He calls back about a day later. Wow. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=380.40000000000003s)]
*  I think you were right. Yeah, I was right. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=384.44s)]
*  That's nothing. You haven't seen anything yet. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=386.28000000000003s)]
*  More importantly than the money coming in, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=387.8s)]
*  we have factories being built, AI, auto factories. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=389.98s)]
*  Two of them stopped yesterday in Mexico, you read. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=393.84000000000003s)]
*  And they're coming here [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=397.84000000000003s)]
*  because they don't want to pay the tariffs. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=399.0s)]
*  They can't pay the tariffs. Doesn't work. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=400.40000000000003s)]
*  So I just want to wish you a lot of luck with the new flagpole. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=402.72s)]
*  We have two of them. And we're going to do this one now. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=407.32000000000005s)]
*  Then we're going to do the other one. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=409.8s)]
*  At 11 o'clock or so, we're going to have a flag raising, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=410.88000000000005s)]
*  which would be great. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=412.96000000000004s)]
*  And I got to get these guys back to work. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=414.44000000000005s)]
*  They're making a fortune. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=416.68s)]
*  They're standing around making a fortune. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=418.40000000000003s)]
*  But remember, there's somewhere in this group, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=420.96000000000004s)]
*  there's somebody that is going to captivate some movie producer. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=423.36s)]
*  Not Harvey Weinstein, but somebody else. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=428.34000000000003s)]
*  Harvey's seen a better day. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=431.20000000000005s)]
*  So it won't be Harvey, but it will be somebody. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=433.36s)]
*  And they'll say, that guy is perfect for a movie. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=435.12s)]
*  And you're going to become a star, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=439.20000000000005s)]
*  and your friends are going to call you, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=440.48s)]
*  and you won't even return their phone call anymore. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=441.68s)]
*  You know? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=443.6s)]
*  Because you say, what do you do for a living? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=444.64000000000004s)]
*  I put up flagpoles. I'm not even going to talk to you. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=446.08000000000004s)]
*  I'm a big movie star. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=449.24s)]
*  So some way or the other, you have that. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsgGTJBl-9U&t=450.68s)]
