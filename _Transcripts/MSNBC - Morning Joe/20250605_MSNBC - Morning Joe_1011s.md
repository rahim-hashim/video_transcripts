# Trump's bill will pass, U.S. headed for recession if tax cuts not enacted, says senator
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo)
*  Let's bring in Republican Senator John Kennedy, also of Louisiana. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=0.0s)]
*  He serves on the banking and the budget committee. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=5.36s)]
*  Senator, thank you so much for being with us. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  Greatly appreciate it. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  I want to ask you about the two issues that we're hearing from Republican senators the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=11.68s)]
*  most, both of which I think you're concerned about. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=17.48s)]
*  Let's start with the one that will affect your constituents, and that is Medicaid. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=21.36s)]
*  The concern about Medicaid cuts. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=26.32s)]
*  You know there's always been this belief in the past, 20 years ago, 30 years ago, that [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=28.52s)]
*  Medicaid was mainly for hospitals and urban centers. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=32.96s)]
*  But a lot of your constituents in Louisiana and also in red state America are also concerned [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=38.6s)]
*  about Medicaid cuts. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=44.72s)]
*  We've heard it from Josh Hawley and others. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  What are you going to be looking at during this process on the issue of Medicaid to protect [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  your constituents? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=54.44s)]
*  Well, certainly Medicaid's important. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=56.32s)]
*  Medicaid is one of the issues we're spending a lot of time on. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=60.2s)]
*  Salt, the salt deduction as well. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=64.28s)]
*  The phase out of the climate tax credits and deductions. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=68.12s)]
*  How quickly we ought to do that. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=74.64s)]
*  How we can reduce more spending. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=77.92s)]
*  Look, I've been through this before, Joe. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=80.64s)]
*  You have to. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=83.88s)]
*  We're at the lively discussion stage. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=85.83999999999999s)]
*  This thing will go one or two directions. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=89.47999999999999s)]
*  It'll either go to, we'll come up with something we can support, or it'll turn into a crime [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=91.32s)]
*  scene. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=97.72s)]
*  I think we'll end up passing a bill, and if you want to talk about it, I'll be glad to [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=98.72s)]
*  tell you why. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=104.0s)]
*  I think a lot of folks are missing the larger issue here. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=105.0s)]
*  But certainly Medicaid's important. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=108.0s)]
*  And the other issue, obviously, that other senators have been talking about, Republican [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=111.92s)]
*  senators, that I've been talking about a good bit, is the debt, the federal debt with $37 [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=115.44000000000001s)]
*  trillion. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=119.80000000000001s)]
*  This adds, CBO says $2.4 trillion. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  There's some quibbling about that, whether their projections are too static or not. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=124.12s)]
*  I'm curious, are your concerns about the spending levels in the bill that the House sent over [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=130.20000000000002s)]
*  to you, is that going to be part of the deliberations in the Senate? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=135.88s)]
*  Is it something that concerns you? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=139.68s)]
*  Yes, sure. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=141.76000000000002s)]
*  I mean, I've said, and will continue to say, because I believe it, that I'm for cutting [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=142.76000000000002s)]
*  spending, unproductive spending, until we run out of votes. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=150.16s)]
*  But we can't do everything that everyone wants. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=157.20000000000002s)]
*  And some people are just going to have to accept a ham and egg sandwich without the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=161.96s)]
*  ham. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=168.8s)]
*  We have some members of the Senate that will not get all the spending reductions they want. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=170.28s)]
*  Here's what's driving this, Joe, and this is ultimately why I think the bill will pass. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=176.24s)]
*  We're in uncharted waters here with the tariffs. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=182.20000000000002s)]
*  I think the market should tell us that. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=185.36s)]
*  We don't know what impact they're going to have on the economy. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=187.04000000000002s)]
*  But if we don't extend those tax cuts, we're going into a recession. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=190.64s)]
*  And our economy is going to be on a journey to the center of the earth. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=195.72s)]
*  And ultimately, I think that's why the bill will pass. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=199.0s)]
*  We're in uncharted territory, as you say, on the tariffs. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=202.95999999999998s)]
*  We're also in uncharted territory on our national debt, $37 trillion. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=206.83999999999997s)]
*  It's just exploded exponentially over the past 20 years or so. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=214.72s)]
*  Do you have any hope that Congress can be responsible, that the House and the Senate [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=219.23999999999998s)]
*  can somehow figure out how to at least bend the line where we start moving back toward [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=226.6s)]
*  a balanced budget? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=231.95999999999998s)]
*  Sure. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=233.39999999999998s)]
*  I mean, I'm an optimist. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=234.39999999999998s)]
*  I'm a paranoid optimist. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=235.92s)]
*  But in the last year, certainly the last 100 to 150 days, the conversation up here has [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=238.22s)]
*  changed. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=245.67999999999998s)]
*  With President Biden, the conversation was basically who needs to pay more in taxes. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=246.96s)]
*  The conversation now, really on both sides of the aisle, quietly more of the Democrats, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=251.28s)]
*  is what the hell happened to the money? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=256.16s)]
*  Elon Musk makes a valid point. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=259.48s)]
*  We have become or will become, if we don't do something about it, debt slaves. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=261.66s)]
*  Mr. Musk says that we need to relearn the magical healing power of no. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=266.84000000000003s)]
*  He's right. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=272.44s)]
*  But you're not going to be able to do it in one bill. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=274.08s)]
*  You're just not. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=276.28s)]
*  That's just practical, political, and frankly, economic reality. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=277.28s)]
*  Let me turn it over to your fellow Louisiana and Walter Isaacson for a question. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=283.03999999999996s)]
*  Walter. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=288.23999999999995s)]
*  How you doing, Senator? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=289.23999999999995s)]
*  Fine, Walter. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=290.23999999999995s)]
*  I wanted to ask you, you say, you can remember the old days when we used to have grand bargains [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=292.0s)]
*  and stuff. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=297.59999999999997s)]
*  Most of the deficit coming out of this bill is because of the extension of the tax cuts. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=299.23999999999995s)]
*  And you say it's important to do that. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=304.08s)]
*  But are there any of those tax cut extensions that are less important than others and could [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=306.44s)]
*  be part of a bargain? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=312.84s)]
*  Sure. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=314.8s)]
*  I don't know if they'll be part of a bargain, Walter. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=316.08s)]
*  I mean, I don't think there's any way that Senator Schumer lets any of his colleagues [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=318.88s)]
*  vote for this bill. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=323.82s)]
*  That's a topic for another day. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=326.56s)]
*  But would there be some of those tax hike extensions? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=328.36s)]
*  I mean, some of those tax cut extensions? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=333.12s)]
*  Do some of them make sense to you to maybe trade off? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=335.48s)]
*  Yeah, we're looking at it right now. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=339.0s)]
*  I mean, we're discussing very seriously what ought to be in the bill. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=341.28000000000003s)]
*  Look, I'm labor, not management. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=345.76000000000005s)]
*  But if I were management, what I'd do is I would tell the Republican senators, we're [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=347.88s)]
*  going to work every weekend until July 4th. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=352.84000000000003s)]
*  And what helps a lot is when we can get together and everybody who wants to have it can have [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=356.44s)]
*  a meltdown. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=362.0s)]
*  Meltdowns are OK. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=363.68s)]
*  You just can't unpack and live there. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=364.68s)]
*  And the sooner people get this out of the system, the better. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=367.08s)]
*  And that's one of the things we're looking at. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=370.72s)]
*  It's a smart play. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=373.04s)]
*  Senator Kerry, good morning. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=374.04s)]
*  You mentioned the tariffs yesterday. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=376.12s)]
*  You grilled Commerce Secretary Lutnick about what seemed to be some ideological inconsistencies [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=378.68s)]
*  as to why this administration is doing these tariffs, for several and the like. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=384.04s)]
*  Talk to us about that moment and whether, frankly, you have faith in the Commerce Secretary's [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=389.26s)]
*  ability to lead the president's tariff plan. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=393.88s)]
*  Well, it's clear that President Trump listens to Secretary Lutnick. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=397.9s)]
*  So I spent the time I had trying to figure out where he's coming from. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=402.98s)]
*  And I don't understand. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=407.48s)]
*  I ask him point blank. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=408.76s)]
*  I mean, my vision of reciprocity, which I think is a good thing, is to lower tariffs, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=410.53999999999996s)]
*  on both sides and let there be a free exchange of goods and services. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=416.58s)]
*  May the best product and the best service win. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=421.5s)]
*  And I thought that's where Secretary Lutnick was going. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=424.09999999999997s)]
*  But I asked him yesterday, if Vietnam, for example, removed every tariff and every trade [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=427.41999999999996s)]
*  barrier, none, zero, not odd, would we remove ours? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=432.18s)]
*  And he said, no, that would be silly. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=436.65999999999997s)]
*  So the obvious question is, who's on first? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=438.52s)]
*  What's on second? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=441.82s)]
*  Why are we having these trade talks? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=442.82s)]
*  And I don't understand, based on his answers. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=444.94s)]
*  I'm going to try to have a conversation with him. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=447.94s)]
*  Well, you lead me to a follow-up question here. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=450.46s)]
*  That same uncertainty is clearly reflected in the markets. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=454.82s)]
*  Business leaders aren't sure where this is going. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=458.86s)]
*  Foreign governments aren't sure where this is going. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=461.38s)]
*  What is the... [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=464.62s)]
*  Can you get a sense as, what is the point of these tariffs? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=465.62s)]
*  Are they creating more chaos and harm than any revenue they may be bringing in? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=468.94s)]
*  Well, I know what the point is for me. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=474.26s)]
*  It's reciprocity. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=475.9s)]
*  But clearly, the markets haven't figured it out yet. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=477.73999999999995s)]
*  I mean, you know that. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=481.26s)]
*  Unless you have an opium habit, you can see that every businesswoman, every businessman, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=483.73999999999995s)]
*  everybody who has money in the market, the bonds or stocks is just going, we don't know [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=490.09999999999997s)]
*  what to do right now because we don't know the impact of the tariffs. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=494.9s)]
*  And what I was trying to do with Mr. Lutnick was sort of flesh out, where are we going [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=498.71999999999997s)]
*  here? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=502.65999999999997s)]
*  And I don't know whether he doesn't know. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=504.66s)]
*  I'm going to assume he was being purposely evasive. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=507.38000000000005s)]
*  But the uncertainty is hurting us, and that's why we don't pass these tax cut extensions. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=511.18s)]
*  Aside from the political ramifications, Congress will do great damage to its 10% approval rating, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=518.86s)]
*  but more importantly, it'll tank this economy, man. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=525.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=529.1800000000001s)]
*  I want to ask you, I want to circle back, because you brought up the salt deductions. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=530.5s)]
*  It's always irritated people that represent states like Louisiana, and back when I was [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=534.42s)]
*  a member of Congress in Florida, it always irritated me when people from high tax states [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=541.8599999999999s)]
*  would push for a salt deduction and an increase of a salt deduction. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=548.9799999999999s)]
*  Because doesn't it say even, and I know there's a leading question, but I think I'm allowed [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=554.14s)]
*  to ask you this leading question, Michelle, but doesn't it seem like it's just encouraging [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=560.1s)]
*  bad behavior? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=565.9s)]
*  It's encouraging state governments to continue to raise taxes if the federal government is [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=567.1800000000001s)]
*  increasing the salt deductions? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=573.4200000000001s)]
*  Well, yes, and that's the point. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=575.62s)]
*  But the salt states have a fair counterpoint, if we're being fair. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=578.5s)]
*  They say, look, we contribute more to the federal government than we get back. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=583.58s)]
*  And a lot of that goes to the states that are complaining about the salt deduction. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=588.9399999999999s)]
*  And that's a fair point. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=594.18s)]
*  But the truth of the matter is, it's $300 to $400 billion, the salt deduction. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=595.3s)]
*  We have to have pay-fors. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=600.98s)]
*  Everybody's screaming, like Congress stole Christmas, about reducing the deficits they're [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=604.3s)]
*  right. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=610.9s)]
*  And the salt deduction is just a low-hanging proof. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=612.04s)]
*  Can I ask you what we have here? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=617.5799999999999s)]
*  I want to move on to another subject that concerns me. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=619.26s)]
*  And I know you probably hear a lot about it as well. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=623.06s)]
*  And I'd love for you to give us some perspective on what we're doing and whether the Senate's [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=626.66s)]
*  going to go along with this. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=633.06s)]
*  There have been a lot of cuts to research and development. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=634.06s)]
*  The president talking about cutting grants to universities where the best and brightest [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=638.3s)]
*  students from across the world come. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=645.0999999999999s)]
*  Obviously, you can look at the founders of Silicon Valley and our biggest startups over [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=647.3399999999999s)]
*  the past 20 years. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=651.4599999999999s)]
*  A lot of them actually are immigrants. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=652.4599999999999s)]
*  I'm wondering, what should the Senate, what do you believe the Senate should do on National [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=656.3s)]
*  Institute of Health cuts and some of the other cuts in research and development, whether [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=662.14s)]
*  it's inside the federal government, are funded the way we've done it since 1945 through our [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=668.76s)]
*  universities? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=675.2399999999999s)]
*  What's your general attitude on that? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=676.2399999999999s)]
*  And where do you think we're going to go in resolving this current standoff? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=678.7199999999999s)]
*  Well, look, I'm a big fan of NIH. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=682.76s)]
*  I think they do breathtakingly innovative work. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=686.3599999999999s)]
*  They've saved millions of lives. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=691.3599999999999s)]
*  One point that NIH needs to get its head around, and I know they're resistant, same for the [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=694.36s)]
*  universities. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=701.36s)]
*  We shouldn't be giving grants where the receiving institution can spend 50 percent on overhead, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=702.84s)]
*  and they're doing that. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=709.16s)]
*  Many of the universities are taking money off the top that's supposed to go to research, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=710.28s)]
*  and they're using it to operate their universities, and that's just a fact. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=715.32s)]
*  We need to do what the Gates Foundation does and say, look, you can spend 10 percent, maybe [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=718.78s)]
*  15 percent on overhead, but we're no longer going to let you spend 50, 60 percent. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=722.88s)]
*  Number two, I think Congress eventually will go through those NIH grants and restore a [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=730.4799999999999s)]
*  lot of them, because a lot of them are good work. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=735.56s)]
*  In terms of the universities, there's a way out of this for the universities. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=738.0799999999999s)]
*  Maybe we can talk about some time that would get the federal government off their back. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=742.5999999999999s)]
*  I'm not saying federal government shouldn't be on their back, because a lot of them deserve [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=747.4399999999999s)]
*  it. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=750.84s)]
*  But universities are important, but they're not the only institution that can do research. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=753.28s)]
*  Frankly, Harvard isn't, nor Columbia, nor Princeton. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=758.28s)]
*  We've got a lot of great universities in America that follow the American Association of University [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=763.08s)]
*  Professors Statement of Principles and practice viewpoint diversity that could do some of [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=770.36s)]
*  this research. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=775.4399999999999s)]
*  I honestly believe, I know people, I'm well aware that President Trump exists loudly, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=776.96s)]
*  but honestly believe that in the case of Harvard, Harvard is in many respects violating federal [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=783.08s)]
*  law. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=788.12s)]
*  They just are. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=789.12s)]
*  And they say, but we're entitled to the money anyway. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=790.12s)]
*  And they're not. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=793.6s)]
*  And it'll be interesting and impactful to see how it turns out. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=794.6s)]
*  And what federal law is Harvard violating? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=802.6s)]
*  Well here's what I think Harvard is doing. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=807.36s)]
*  Harvard practices ideological capture. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=811.28s)]
*  They don't practice viewpoint diversity. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=815.0s)]
*  I think among the sciences, but the humanities, Harvard teaches, for example, that the world [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=816.88s)]
*  is divided between oppressors and the oppressed. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=823.6s)]
*  And oppressors should be punished and they're evil, like America, Israel. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=827.28s)]
*  The oppressed are victims and they should be helped at any cost. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=831.56s)]
*  I think that leads Harvard to support racial quotas. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=836.04s)]
*  I think they're still using racial quotas. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=840.4799999999999s)]
*  I think that supports Harvard to believe in diversity, equity, inclusion, and the right [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=843.3199999999999s)]
*  to harm the Jewish people. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=849.52s)]
*  And I think that violates most of the civil rights laws. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=851.8s)]
*  The way out of this, the federal government said, look Harvard, are you doing this? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=856.16s)]
*  Harvard says no. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=863.16s)]
*  The government says, well how do we know that? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=865.72s)]
*  And Harvard says, I give you a pinky promise. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=868.04s)]
*  Maybe we were at one time, but we're not anymore. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=870.4s)]
*  What Harvard needs to agree to is a monitor. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=873.36s)]
*  A monitor that they pick. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=876.56s)]
*  And Trump has offered this to them. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=879.04s)]
*  Harvard pick a monitor to verify that they're not breaking federal law. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=881.0s)]
*  Now the federal government would have a veto power over the monitor, and that to me is [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=886.36s)]
*  the short way home. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=890.8s)]
*  But I don't think Harvard's going to do that. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=892.12s)]
*  I think they're trying to wait out President Trump. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=894.88s)]
*  They figure a Democrat will come in and they can go back to normal. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=899.52s)]
*  So you're saying almost like an Ombudsman. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=903.76s)]
*  Newspapers used to have Ombudsman's. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=907.48s)]
*  You're saying somebody that Harvard appoints themselves that the government can agree on [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=910.56s)]
*  and that can act as sort of an Ombudsman between Harvard and the federal government. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=916.8s)]
*  Yeah, I don't want to run Harvard University. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=923.4399999999999s)]
*  I mean, and I don't think any fair-minded person wants government to run a university. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=925.88s)]
*  Hell, we can barely run the post office. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=933.8s)]
*  But the truth of the matter is that I honestly believe Harvard is violating federal civil [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=938.24s)]
*  rights laws. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=943.44s)]
*  I mean, I've seen what you've seen. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=944.44s)]
*  And the fair way out of this is a monitor, not a censor, a monitor that's acceptable [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=946.08s)]
*  to federal government. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=952.64s)]
*  If Harvard's telling the truth and they say pinky promise, we're not doing it anymore, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=953.64s)]
*  then you know, what's the old saying? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=959.04s)]
*  I say it a lot. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=961.88s)]
*  You know, trust in God but tie up your camel. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=962.88s)]
*  Let a monitor come in, both sides acceptable, and report back to everybody. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=965.84s)]
*  Republican Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana, thank you very much for coming on the show [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=973.08s)]
*  this morning. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ2jXSrCXwo&t=978.64s)]
