# 'Insane': Joe Rogan slams ICE arrests of migrant workers
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [July 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4)
*  22 past the hour, as I mentioned earlier, the U.S. deported eight men to South Sudan [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=0.0s)]
*  on Friday after the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Trump administration's effort [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=7.68s)]
*  to deport migrants to third countries. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=13.42s)]
*  The men from six different nations were held for weeks at an American military base before [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=17.68s)]
*  a federal judge denied a request from their lawyers to stop their relocation over fears [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=24.44s)]
*  of torture. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=30.040000000000003s)]
*  U.S. administration officials said all eight men had been convicted of serious crimes in [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=31.040000000000003s)]
*  the U.S. prior to their deportation. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=37.32s)]
*  That comes, as Axios notes this morning, quote, the MAGA movement is reveling in the creativity, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=40.88s)]
*  and accelerating force of President Trump's historic immigration crackdown, and that once-fringe [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  tactics and alligator-moted detention camp, deportations to war zones, denaturalization [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=58.28s)]
*  of immigrant citizens are now being proudly embraced at the highest levels of the U.S. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=66.80000000000001s)]
*  government. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=72.60000000000001s)]
*  The report continues, and it's an extraordinary shift from Trump's first term, when nationwide [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=73.6s)]
*  backlash and the appearance of cruelty forced the administration to abandon its family separation [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=79.83999999999999s)]
*  policy for unauthorized immigrants. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=86.3s)]
*  And now the newly signed spending law will provide the administration an influx of billions [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=90.03999999999999s)]
*  of dollars in new funding for immigration enforcement. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=96.28s)]
*  Meanwhile, Joe Rogan is once again speaking out about President Donald Trump's immigration [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=101.04s)]
*  policies. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=105.72s)]
*  During an episode of his podcast last week, Rogan criticized the president's immigration [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=107.44s)]
*  enforcement tactics that have seen nonviolent immigrants swept up in ICE raids. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=112.52000000000001s)]
*  We were told there would be no, well, there's two things that are insane. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=120.44s)]
*  One is the targeting of migrant workers, not cartel members, not gang members, not [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=125.08s)]
*  drug dealers, just construction workers showing up in construction sites and raiding them, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=134.0s)]
*  gardeners. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=140.48s)]
*  Like, really? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=141.48s)]
*  Rogan first criticized Trump's immigration policies earlier this year, after a Venezuelan [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=145.0s)]
*  asylum seeker was deported to El Salvador despite having no gang affiliations. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=150.52s)]
*  The co-host of MSNBC's The Weekend Primetime, Elise Jordan, is back with us. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=158.0s)]
*  Also joining us, opinion writer at The New York Times, Mara Gay. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=163.68s)]
*  And Mara, I'm first of all wondering, I'm trying to think of the limits that might be [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=168.60000000000002s)]
*  pushed with this new funding coming in from the bill. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=175.4s)]
*  Limits? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=179.08s)]
*  I think, unfortunately, what we're seeing is that these ICE raids have now, it's going [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  to just be turbocharged and without any kind of accountability. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=188.60000000000002s)]
*  Congress has not shown an appetite under Republican control for any kind of oversight. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=193.28s)]
*  And we're talking about spending dollars for ICE and ICE raids and DHS that rival some [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=200.28s)]
*  countries, the entire budget of other countries. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=207.8s)]
*  So there's a lot of concerns about just wantonness, I would say. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=211.96s)]
*  We already don't actually have much insight at all into what's happening on America's [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=218.6s)]
*  streets, where these raids are happening, the way they're being conducted. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=225.2s)]
*  I think that Americans should be asking their congresspeople to take a far more active role [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=231.07999999999998s)]
*  in oversight. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=240.0s)]
*  And I think there's just an underlying tragedy here. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=241.0s)]
*  We were told for years, I'm not even 40 years old, I remember being told there's no money [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=246.2s)]
*  in America for healthcare, for public education, for new parks, all kinds of initiatives that [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=252.92000000000002s)]
*  we were told there's no money for this. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=262.72s)]
*  But suddenly there's money to deport farm workers, there's money to sweep up people [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=264.32s)]
*  who worked with our troops in Afghanistan, there's funding to separate families, people [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=271.88s)]
*  who have really not committed crimes but have come here to work to be a part of this country. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=278.92s)]
*  And I just think that the cruelty underlying this really shows that this isn't about immigration [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=285.92s)]
*  policy for this White House. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=292.4s)]
*  This is about a policy of othering people who are not seen as American enough. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=294.96s)]
*  And I think that is chilling. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=304.52s)]
*  You see that through line with this Alcatraz. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=308.08s)]
*  It's so disturbing, it's honestly hard to get my words around it. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=311.08s)]
*  Mara, I do think you hit the nail on the head though talking about the cruelty. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=318.08s)]
*  It sounds like the migrants who are being deported to South Sudan have committed some [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=322.08s)]
*  pretty unsavory crimes. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=327.8s)]
*  How is it within humanitarian law to send people to a war zone, to an active war zone? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=330.96000000000004s)]
*  Okay, Mika, I just think it sounds insane and I just can't believe we're doing this [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=339.96000000000004s)]
*  as a country. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=345.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcnx3kAa9J4&t=360.04s)]
