# 'Serious and dangerous' for the economy: Trump's messaging scares some of his own advisers
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [March 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc)
*  All right, President Trump's trade policy has even rattled some of his own allies, as [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=0.0s)]
*  both Republican lawmakers and business executives have flooded the White House with calls of [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=4.7s)]
*  concern. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=10.92s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal reports senior officials, including White House Chief of Staff Suzy [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  Wiles, have received panicked calls from chief executives and lobbyists who have urged the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=16.66s)]
*  administration to calm jittery markets by outlining a more predictable tariff agenda, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=23.580000000000002s)]
*  according to people familiar with discussions. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=29.52s)]
*  Many in the business community have abandoned efforts to get the president to reverse course [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=31.88s)]
*  on trade, instead pleading with the White House for clarity on his approach, the people [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=36.6s)]
*  said. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=42.4s)]
*  The paper continues, the mixed messages from the president and his advisors have raised [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=43.4s)]
*  concerns among some Republicans that Trump lacks a cohesive economic plan. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal's editorial board is asking, how do you like the trade war now? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=55.72s)]
*  Its piece reads in part, commerce secretary Howard Lutnick said over the weekend that [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=61.559999999999995s)]
*  the president's tariffs would make some foreign products more expensive, but American products [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=67.08s)]
*  will get cheaper. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=72.36s)]
*  Huh? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=74.0s)]
*  Companies that use foreign components will have to raise prices or swallow narrower profit [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=75.0s)]
*  margins. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=81.24s)]
*  Does Mr. Lutnick understand? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=82.24s)]
*  Well, commerce, the trouble with trade wars is that once they begin, they can quickly [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=84.6s)]
*  escalate and get out of control. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=89.84s)]
*  All the more so when politicians are nearing an election campaign, as Canada now is, or [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  when Mr. Trump behaves as if his manhood is implicated because a foreign nation won't [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  take his nasty border taxes lying down. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=104.52s)]
*  We said from the beginning that this North American trade war is the dumbest in history, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=108.36s)]
*  and we were being kind. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=115.08s)]
*  That's Wall Street Journal editorial page, obviously. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=116.64s)]
*  The conservative voice, really, the intellectual conservative voice and the voice of most conservatives [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=119.6s)]
*  and traders on Wall Street. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=128.28s)]
*  Joe mentioned the coverage yesterday on CNBC. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=129.64s)]
*  Here's some of the reaction from senior economics reporter Steve Leesman. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  What President Trump is doing is insane. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=137.6s)]
*  It is absolutely insane. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=140.18s)]
*  It is about the eighth reason we've had for the tariffs, and now he's saying he's putting [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=141.92s)]
*  50 percent tariffs on Canada unless they agree to become the 51st state. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=146.95999999999998s)]
*  That is insane. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=152.2s)]
*  There is just no other way of describing it. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=153.2s)]
*  And the trouble, Kelly, is that it shows there are no bounds around President Trump. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  This is very different from the first administration, where there were people around him who seemed [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=161.28s)]
*  I don't know what the word is, but smooth over some of the edges now. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=166.35999999999999s)]
*  And the other thing that's not talked about, Kelly, is what's going on within the administration [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=170.51999999999998s)]
*  in terms of how they're treating the Constitution and laws. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=174.28s)]
*  I think all of that is bad for the attraction of capital. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  David Ignatius, we actually turned on CNBC yesterday, something that I can't say I've [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=181.64s)]
*  ever done in the middle of the day. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=187.88s)]
*  Not a trader. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=189.54s)]
*  Not a day trader. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=190.54s)]
*  Yesterday, in fact, we don't usually watch news during the day. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=192.36s)]
*  You know, we read it more. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=198.32000000000002s)]
*  But we said yesterday, why, hmm, let's turn on CNBC. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=202.04000000000002s)]
*  And it was remarkable. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=208.72000000000003s)]
*  And one of the reasons we wanted to turn on CNBC is because, you know, most people that [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=210.16000000000003s)]
*  watch CNBC voted for Donald Trump. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=215.60000000000002s)]
*  It is a conservative network. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=217.96s)]
*  And it's just conservative with a small C as it pertains to business. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=221.28s)]
*  They want to make money. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=227.16s)]
*  That's why they're watching CNBC. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=228.16s)]
*  But we were shocked by what we heard on it. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=231.88s)]
*  It really does parallel a lot of what the Wall Street Journal editorial page said. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=234.52s)]
*  Again, bedrock conservatives, again, warning against these moves that are draining trillions [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=238.56s)]
*  of dollars from the economy. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=247.92s)]
*  And as Mr. Ducey said at Fox News yesterday, making people's 401Ks go, I think he said, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=250.0s)]
*  down, down, down, down, down. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=258.56s)]
*  And let me just tell you, that is something that a member of Congress hears about on the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=260.84s)]
*  campaign trail or in his district office. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=265.71999999999997s)]
*  You know, Joe, I think we're all watching CNN or CNBC figuratively, if not literally, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=268.28s)]
*  because we're all implicated in this. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=275.72s)]
*  You know, the financial market slide is something that's going to affect all of us in our savings, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=277.84000000000003s)]
*  our retirement plans. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=283.32000000000005s)]
*  And I think there is a sense of shock. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=285.76000000000005s)]
*  The standard business view of Trump was, well, he's a disruptor. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=288.92s)]
*  You know, he loves to come in and shake things up. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=294.16s)]
*  He has his big bowl proposals for tariffs or whatever. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=295.96000000000004s)]
*  But he'll back off. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=298.90000000000003s)]
*  That's the way he negotiates. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=300.08000000000004s)]
*  He's the dealmaker. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=301.08000000000004s)]
*  So he'll shake things up, and then the deal will come. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=302.68s)]
*  And what we're seeing in these first six, seven weeks is that Trump is more determined. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=306.16s)]
*  He's more confident, more insistent. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=313.36s)]
*  I was thinking there's a little bit of Captain Ahab in him pursuing the white whale. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=316.48s)]
*  He just won't stop. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=320.64s)]
*  He won't pull back from some of these ideas. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=321.8s)]
*  And I think as people watch CNBC or whatever, there's a dawning sense this is really going [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=325.76s)]
*  to be serious and dangerous for our country's economy. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=332.08s)]
*  And I think it's that fear factor that leads us to watch the financial news. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=336.0s)]
*  In truth, we're making a bit of a joke about it, but it's deadly serious for the American [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=341.68s)]
*  people. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=347.2s)]
*  And the political reaction, I think, is going to be very significant. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=348.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=350.52s)]
*  And for our national security. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=351.52s)]
*  It's a financial sort of version of what we do in Florida every time a hurricane weather [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=352.52s)]
*  channel goes on. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=357.96s)]
*  Oh. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=358.96s)]
*  The weather channel is in the background for days. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=360.12s)]
*  But it's certainly in the background in a lot of Americans' homes right now in a way [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=362.68s)]
*  that's not usually there because, again, their retirement accounts are 401Ks. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=368.64s)]
*  I mean, so much depends on the volatility of the markets. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=372.28s)]
*  Jim Cramer also talking about how this could be a manufactured recession. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=376.96s)]
*  This is what I will say. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=384.08s)]
*  This is one thing that most of the analysts who were talking yesterday deeply concerned [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=385.21999999999997s)]
*  about tariffs and what was going on. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=393.0s)]
*  They say, we don't have to have a recession. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=395.0s)]
*  And Jim Cramer called it a manufactured recession. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=398.96s)]
*  But I think what they're concerned about mainly, well, they're concerned about a manufactured [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=403.03999999999996s)]
*  recession, but not even a manufactured recession. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=408.2s)]
*  Wall Street Journal says hard landing fears start to grow. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=411.47999999999996s)]
*  You know, we've been talking about this remarkable soft landing that the United States has been [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=416.15999999999997s)]
*  going through over the past six to nine months. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=419.88s)]
*  Now that landing is not quite so soft. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=423.44s)]
*  It's a hard landing. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=426.15999999999997s)]
*  And as Jim Cramer at CNBC says, it's not because of natural market forces. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=427.47999999999996s)]
*  It's because it is manufactured by policy. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=431.21999999999997s)]
*  So a lot more to talk about there and also make a great breakthrough for the Ukrainian [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=434.84s)]
*  people yesterday in Saudi Arabia. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=439.68s)]
*  We can only hope. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=441.32s)]
*  I'm still ahead on Morning Joe. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=442.32s)]
*  We'll get to that possible breakthrough when it comes to the war in Ukraine. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=443.8s)]
*  Kyiv has agreed to a 30 day ceasefire proposal from the United States. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=447.84000000000003s)]
*  But where does Russia stand on it? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=453.8s)]
*  Morning Joe is back in 90 seconds. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=456.52000000000004s)]
*  I don't think we'll have a recession. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=460.0s)]
*  Like I said, it's manufactured. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=461.0s)]
*  It's a manufactured. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=462.0s)]
*  Well, that doesn't mean there won't be. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=463.0s)]
*  I'm not sure I understand. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8h0hN4Nuc&t=465.68s)]
