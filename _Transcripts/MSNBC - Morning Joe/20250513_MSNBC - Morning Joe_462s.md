# Trump arrives in Riyadh hoping to make big deals
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY)
*  Other news, President Trump is kicking off his four-day visit to the Middle East. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=0.0s)]
*  This is a live look at the royal court in Riyadh, where the president and Saudi Crown [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=5.08s)]
*  Prince Mohammed bin Salman are meeting key members of each country's delegation. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=10.48s)]
*  The two leaders are set to hold more formal meetings in which they'll discuss a variety [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=16.36s)]
*  of issues, including the war in Gaza, efforts to dismantle Iran's nuclear program, and ways [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=22.36s)]
*  to keep oil prices down. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=29.68s)]
*  But the primary focus of the president's trip is to shore up business deals. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=31.84s)]
*  Late this morning, the president will attend an investment forum with Saudi officials. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=36.32s)]
*  It comes as the kingdom has committed to a $600 billion investment in the U.S. over the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=40.88s)]
*  next four years. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=48.56s)]
*  But the president is pushing for a full trillion dollars. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=50.8s)]
*  David Ignatius, if you could break this down for us. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=55.32s)]
*  So, Mika, it's fascinating to see Trump arriving in a kingdom where the wealth and splendor [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=58.92s)]
*  dazzle him. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=67.32000000000001s)]
*  This was his first stop when he became president in 2017. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=69.72s)]
*  It's not surprising that it's his second stop in this second term. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=73.56s)]
*  It's a place where he, I think, feels a kind of kinship with the Saudi royalty. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=78.72s)]
*  I would also note that Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates have been very [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=84.64s)]
*  active in the past. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=91.64s)]
*  They've been very active in the past. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=93.64s)]
*  They've been very active in the past. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=95.64s)]
*  They've been very active in the past. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=97.64s)]
*  They've been very active in the past. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=99.64s)]
*  They've been very active in the past. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=101.64s)]
*  They've been very active in the past. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=103.64s)]
*  They've been very active in the past. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=105.64s)]
*  They've been very active in the past. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=107.64s)]
*  They've been very active in the past. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=109.64s)]
*  I would also note that Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, the other destinations [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=111.64s)]
*  on this trip, have become increasingly important strategically for the United States. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=117.64s)]
*  These are the places now where meetings take place that are intended to resolve conflicts. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=122.64s)]
*  In the Ukraine War, Russia and Ukraine sent their representatives to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=131.64s)]
*  then to Riyadh for key talks. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=136.64s)]
*  Qatar has hosted almost all the key negotiations to free the Israeli hostages in Gaza [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=138.64s)]
*  and have a resolution of the war there. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=145.64s)]
*  The UAE was said to be helpful to the United States as it tried to de-escalate tensions [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=148.64s)]
*  between Pakistan and India. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=153.64s)]
*  So these are not just economic friends, wealthy and able to invest in the U.S. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=155.64s)]
*  They're strategic partners. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=160.64s)]
*  And that, to me, that's a big difference from what we saw eight years ago during the last trip. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=162.64s)]
*  And I think that all the time, you know, Saudis dreamed of having influence today. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=167.64s)]
*  They really do have it, thanks to their role as a mediator. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=172.64s)]
*  Well, and you know, David, also you have, again, the Saudis in the role as a mediator [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=176.64s)]
*  and the other countries in the middle also because they've been talking for some time, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=183.64s)]
*  certainly the Saudis and the UAE, about the rebuilding of Gaza, if that were to ever happen [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=187.64s)]
*  and taking a more active role in that, of course, those plans seem to be on the sidelines right now. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=193.64s)]
*  But it is remarkable how much, as you've said, over the past eight, 10 years, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=199.64s)]
*  the center of power has shifted in the Middle East. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=204.64s)]
*  And again, you have a trip here, as many people have noted, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=209.64s)]
*  where an American president is going to the Middle East and not stopping in Israel. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=213.64s)]
*  What do you read into that? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=218.64s)]
*  So I think we see in President Trump a growing frustration with Israel, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=220.64s)]
*  with Prime Minister Netanyahu, who's been slow, seemingly unable to end the war in Gaza. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=225.64s)]
*  Trump sent his emissary Steve Wittkopf finally to have negotiations separately [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=234.64s)]
*  that led to the freeing of the American Israeli hostage, Edan Alexander. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=240.64s)]
*  I think Trump is similarly uneasy, unhappy about the pressure he's getting from Israel [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=245.64s)]
*  to consider a military strike on Iran. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=251.64s)]
*  Trump would rather go for the big deal to cap Iran's nuclear program, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=254.64s)]
*  even though it doesn't look very different from what he scuttled in 2018 in the so-called JCPOA. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=259.64s)]
*  But when Trump says America first, he means it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=267.64s)]
*  And he means that even in the case of our historically closest ally in the region, Israel, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=272.64s)]
*  Israel's interests, while powerful, do not in Trump's mind supersede those of the United States. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=278.64s)]
*  An extraordinary example published by The New York Times last night, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=288.64s)]
*  it's one of the best stories I've seen in weeks, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=292.64s)]
*  details Trump's frustration with the campaign against the Iranian-backed Houthis. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=294.64s)]
*  That his decision after 30 days, that's it, let's declare a victory. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=300.64s)]
*  He was given a plan for eight months of military campaign, decided this isn't going anywhere, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=305.64s)]
*  it's not worth the money, and did it without talking to the Israelis who were directly threatened by the Houthis. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=310.64s)]
*  That's a very different command and control environment than I've ever seen. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=316.64s)]
*  I've been covering the Middle East for 40 years. This really surprised me. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=322.64s)]
*  John, let's talk a little bit about the pageantry we're watching on the other side of our screen, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=325.64s)]
*  this long receiving line of, frankly, rich guys coming to get their 30 seconds with President Trump [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=329.64s)]
*  and with the Crown Prince. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=336.64s)]
*  The Crown Prince greeted President Trump at the airport a short time ago, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=338.64s)]
*  an honor he did not offer President Biden in 2022 when he arrived. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=342.64s)]
*  The President's limousine, the Beast, was exported to the royal court by Arabian horses. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=347.64s)]
*  The Saudis know how to put on a show, they know how to welcome President Trump. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=352.64s)]
*  I think people remember in that visit in 2017 when they projected his face onto the side of the Ritz-Carlton hotel there. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=356.64s)]
*  Yeah, the Saudis created a template that was his, Trump's first trip was May 2017. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=362.64s)]
*  I was on that trip traveling with the presidential pool. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=367.64s)]
*  The images of the President and the King were draped on every building, as the motor kid went down the highway on his hotel. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=370.64s)]
*  The Ritz-Carlton, they put up his face, as you say, in digital imagery. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=378.64s)]
*  The same hotel, by the way, that Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince, usually later used to detain his political prisoners. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=383.64s)]
*  That was the trip of the orb, where the President and the King and the head of Egypt all stood with it. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=388.64s)]
*  Yes, they created, the Saudis figured out early the trick for President Trump is to flatter him, to treat him like royalty, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=395.64s)]
*  which is what he wanted, and we saw that on that trip. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=401.64s)]
*  We are seeing it again now. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=403.64s)]
*  And yes, the White House has said, look, this is about business, we're trying to get deals, the trillion dollar mark, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=405.64s)]
*  although that seems unlikely, but of course there are geopolitics that are going to creep in here. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=410.64s)]
*  The situation in Gaza, the Gulf states will push him to come up with some sort of plan there for the Palestinians, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=414.64s)]
*  the Iran deal as well, they're going to want some sort of solution there. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=421.64s)]
*  But right now, as we're seeing the President a short time ago with the Crown Prince, he is strengthening ties to the region, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=426.64s)]
*  and it's really about economic and business development rather than strategy, Mika. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=433.64s)]
*  All right, we'll be continuing to follow this. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSuhOWQxVY&t=438.64s)]
