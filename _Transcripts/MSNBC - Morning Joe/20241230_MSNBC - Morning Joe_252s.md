# Black male voters and the 2024 election
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [December 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ)
*  A look at the 2024 election and the emergence of an unexpected group of voters. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=0.0s)]
*  NBC News correspondent Tremaine Lee explains. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=6.08s)]
*  The 2024 presidential election year was a roller coaster, marked by politics not as usual. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=12.48s)]
*  And the remarkable new focus on an unexpected group of voters. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=21.52s)]
*  Blackmail voters could prove to be a key swing voting block. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=24.88s)]
*  As primary season kicked off, some voters seemed unenthused. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=28.16s)]
*  What is missing from like the election cycle? What is missing? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=33.12s)]
*  Ah, a good candidate right now. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=36.88s)]
*  What's the word that you think when you see these two candidates running for president? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=39.6s)]
*  Oh hell no. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=43.44s)]
*  And Democrats worried about their base. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=46.24s)]
*  The president's support among black voters is slipping. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=48.72s)]
*  The recent NBC News poll shows just 61% would now choose him over a Republican. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  He's about to lose me. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=57.68s)]
*  While former president Donald Trump eyed a potential opening. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=59.84s)]
*  Donald Trump's campaign is targeting young black men, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=63.44s)]
*  believing that this year the GOP can win them over. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=66.4s)]
*  I love the black population of this country. I've done so much for the black population of this [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=69.76s)]
*  country. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=74.88s)]
*  As this long overlooked voting block made it clear what mattered most to them. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=75.44s)]
*  Anything that's going to directly affect my community. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=80.64s)]
*  We are entrepreneurs and we are business persons and we are homeowners and we [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=83.36s)]
*  want some real discussions around economic matters in the community. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=87.52s)]
*  Some felt ignored. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  We haven't heard anything from a Democrat or a Republican. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=94.16s)]
*  Some felt empowered. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=98.8s)]
*  And I want to make a decision that is going to be impactful. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=100.16s)]
*  We need to save ourselves. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=104.39999999999999s)]
*  If we're looking for somebody to save us, it's not going to happen. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=106.24s)]
*  A tug and pull between the status quo and the hope for something new. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  People come to our communities and pander for our votes. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=113.12s)]
*  And then an 11th hour candidate shakeup. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=116.0s)]
*  It's not about me. It's about you. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=118.88s)]
*  President Biden bowed out of the race. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=121.52s)]
*  Are you ready to make your voices heard? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=123.68s)]
*  And vice president Kamala Harris became the nominee. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  And when we fight, we win. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=129.68s)]
*  And suddenly there was something new along with new energy for candidate Kamala Harris. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=133.76s)]
*  Looking to make history as the country's first Indian, black and woman president. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=139.76s)]
*  Let's get out and make Kamala Harris the 47th president. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=144.16s)]
*  A slew of black celebrities showing their support. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=148.96s)]
*  Our black men, we got to get them out to vote. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=151.6s)]
*  While the Trump campaign had its own endorsements. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=154.4s)]
*  Let's vote for Trump, baby. Make some noise for the president. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=156.72s)]
*  The former president courted controversy with his version of black voter outreach. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  They're taking black jobs. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=164.4s)]
*  You see black people walking around with my mug shot. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=165.76s)]
*  And a lot of people said that that's why the black people like me, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=168.64s)]
*  because they have been hurt so badly and discriminated against. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=172.16s)]
*  But for some black men, there was an appeal beyond Trump being Trump. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=175.68s)]
*  He has good folks around him and good policy. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=179.52s)]
*  And so that's all I'm looking for. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=184.56s)]
*  In the end, the vast majority of black voters, including black men, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=186.48s)]
*  stood by VP Harris, many dreaming of a new way forward. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=190.96s)]
*  I voted for Kamala. I think it's time to try something new. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  But there were unforecasted shifts and a surprising realignment of voters, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=198.64s)]
*  including growth with Hispanic men and young people, among them young black men, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=203.6s)]
*  all moving toward Trump. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=208.72s)]
*  The Democratic Party now trying to understand shifts in its core coalition. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=210.16s)]
*  And setting the stage for a reckoning to come in American presidential politics. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=214.96s)]
*  President-elect Trump will be inaugurated on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  begging for some, the question of what happens to a dream deferred. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPUi5h3tTfQ&t=224.4s)]
