# 'Incoherent gut instincts': Tom Friedman rebukes Trump for not thinking of where the world is going
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk)
*  Talking about the Middle East this morning and the disruption that Donald Trump has caused in the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=0.0s)]
*  Middle East, and just so people that are watching are going, oh, there they go again, just blindly [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  attacking Donald Trump. I want you to talk about the column you wrote a couple of weeks ago, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=9.6s)]
*  where you're actually encouraging Donald Trump to do exactly what he did when he went to the Middle [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=14.24s)]
*  East, and that is give Netanyahu the cold shoulder. Why was that important? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=18.16s)]
*  Well, basically, what Netanyahu has done with all previous presidents, Joe, is do an end run around [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=24.16s)]
*  them, leveraging Congress against them, by the way, whether it was Democrats or Republicans, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  particularly evangelicals in Congress. Along comes Trump, and he's basically a block of that move. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=36.800000000000004s)]
*  All Republicans are now lined up behind him, so Netanyahu cannot pull that lever anymore. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=44.32000000000001s)]
*  And I don't think without Trump, we would have any hope of a hostage deal right now, because [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=50.08s)]
*  Netanyahu's own political survival depends on him continuing the war. So I think it's good what the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=55.76s)]
*  president did. I think it's also really good what the president did in opening a dialogue with the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=60.96s)]
*  new leader of Syria. Syria is such a keystone country. You know, Joe, some countries, when [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=66.0s)]
*  they're decapitated, they implode. Other countries, they explode. Syria is a country that explodes. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=72.0s)]
*  It sends instability all over the region. And if you fix Syria, you actually can fix Lebanon, Iraq. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=78.48s)]
*  It really opens the way for a lot of new possibilities. And on Iran, I'm glad he's [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=86.56s)]
*  negotiating with Iran. I want to see what deal he strikes. But this is where Trump's just sort [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  of willingness to turn over the table, throw all the cards up, think of everything new and fresh, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=96.56s)]
*  I think is very healthy in a region that's completely encrusted. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=101.68s)]
*  You know, 25 years ago, around 25 years ago—I can't believe how old we are, Tom—you wrote, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=106.0s)]
*  Alexis and the Olive Tree, and you talked about how the finances of the Middle East would trump [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=112.64s)]
*  eventually—pardon the pun—the religion and thousands and thousands of years of [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=118.80000000000001s)]
*  of just infighting. I'm curious if this trip, even though for whatever purpose Donald Trump [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=126.88s)]
*  had in mind when he went to this trip, I'm wondering if him talking to Saudi Arabia and the UAE and [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=136.64s)]
*  the Qataris about business instead of going to Israel and continuing to try to broker a peace [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=145.27999999999997s)]
*  deal that's just never coming, at least not for now. I'm wondering if you sort of see that as [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=157.11999999999998s)]
*  moving in the direction, more of a commercial direction, that you were talking about in that [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=163.27999999999997s)]
*  book. Joe, it's a really good question. You know, I arrived in Beirut as a cub reporter in 1979. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=167.04s)]
*  The first four stories I covered were the Iranian Revolution, the takeover of the Grand Mosque in [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=175.27999999999997s)]
*  Mecca, the signing of the Camp David peace treaty, and actually the inauguration of a port in a [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  little obscure town by Queen Elizabeth II called Jabal Ali Port in Dubai. And what you saw there [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=187.51999999999998s)]
*  was the tension between the forces of integration in the region, globalization of Dubai, Camp David, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=194.56s)]
*  and the disintegrative forces that take over the mosque and Mecca and the Iranian Revolution. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=202.24s)]
*  What's happened in the last year—and by the way, as a result of what something Netanyahu did, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=207.44s)]
*  the destruction of Iran's threat network in Lebanon, in Syria, and the weakening of Iran [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=212.88s)]
*  basically has tilted the whole region, as you suggested, Joe, toward the forces of inclusion. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=219.36s)]
*  Netanyahu set that off. The tragedy of the moment is that Bibi Netanyahu will not harvest [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=225.52s)]
*  what he sowed, because to take advantage of this inclusion, the fact that the forces of inclusion [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=232.48s)]
*  are now winning, all right, he has to do a deal with the Palestinian Authority, open the way to [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=237.76s)]
*  a two-state solution. I was just in Israel. I told Israelis, your leader is making the worst trade [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=242.8s)]
*  in Jewish history. He's trading peace with Saudi Arabia, the most important Muslim nation, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=248.64s)]
*  for peace with Smotrich and the other right-wing goofballs in his cabinet. It's a terrible, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=254.56s)]
*  terrible trade. And the fact that Trump is beating him over the head on that, I say hallelujah. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=260.4s)]
*  Tom, let me ask you about Russia as we bounce around the globe this morning. President Trump [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=266.4s)]
*  came out with a bit of a readout yesterday of a call with Vladimir Putin that lasted more than an [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=270.96s)]
*  hour, not terribly productive. It doesn't look like they moved any closer to a ceasefire, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=275.6s)]
*  negotiations to end the war. Consistently, President Trump has placed the burden on Ukraine, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=280.96s)]
*  on Zelensky to give concessions to end the war. Where do you see this headed, and how [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=287.44s)]
*  efficiently, how effectively has Vladimir Putin played this president, frankly? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=294.4s)]
*  Well, Willie, Donald Trump is not a Russian agent. I want to make that very clear. But, man, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=299.67999999999995s)]
*  he sure knows how to play one on television. Because when I hear his readout of the call [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=305.12s)]
*  with Putin, you know what he reminds me of? He reminds me of Pete Hegson, not as Secretary [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=310.8s)]
*  of Defense, as a commentator on Fox TV. Oh, I talked to Putin, and man, he's mad. He's going [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=315.68s)]
*  to hit back at Ukraine. Well, what did you say? I don't need you to tell me that. He acts like a [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=322.0s)]
*  Fox commentator when it comes to Russia, not an American president exercising our leverage. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=329.84s)]
*  Richard Haass and others said this earlier. Trump came into office thinking that basically there was [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=336.64s)]
*  a misunderstanding in Ukraine that we just weren't nice enough to Vladimir Putin, that he wants peace [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=343.76s)]
*  and Zelensky wants peace. No, Vladimir Putin wants victory. Zelensky wants to preserve his country. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=349.76s)]
*  And until we understand that the war won't end until Putin is dissuaded from the prospect of [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=356.64s)]
*  any kind of victory, we're just going to be spinning our wheels there. And it's going to [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=361.44s)]
*  get more and more dangerous. Tom, I'm happy to see you here today because you're the only person that [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=364.96s)]
*  I know of that could clear up some mysteries surrounding this entire episode in the Middle East. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=370.64s)]
*  And I'm referring to the atrocities that occurred nearly 20 months ago in Israel when Hamas massacred [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=376.48s)]
*  so many Israeli citizens. So today I'd like to ask you why the delay and the refusal to really [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=383.84s)]
*  get the hostage situation taken care of? Why is there such a lot of consternation about the behavior [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=392.15999999999997s)]
*  of the Israeli army in Gaza? And why is Bibi Netanyahu constantly nearly every day placing himself [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=400.79999999999995s)]
*  above this critical situation that is slowly, slowly destroying what has been happening [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=409.04s)]
*  in terms of peace offerings in the Middle East? You know, Mike, let me begin by saying Hamas [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=415.92s)]
*  started this war. It is a terrible, a jihadi fascist organization that has been a curse on [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=422.96000000000004s)]
*  the Palestinian people. And what it did on October 7th, killing Israeli mothers in front of their [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=430.40000000000003s)]
*  kids, kids in front of their parents, was disgusting and vile. Not only that, if you think of where Hamas [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=435.12s)]
*  is today, what is their position, Mike? Their position is we will stop the war. We will return [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=443.28000000000003s)]
*  the hostages and the bodies that we are holding, which itself is grotesque. We will do that if [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=449.76s)]
*  Israel will get out of Gaza and agree to a permanent ceasefire. Oh, wait a minute. Get out of Gaza and [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=455.76s)]
*  agree to a permanent ceasefire. What did you guys have on October 6th, the day before this war? You [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=463.2s)]
*  had Israel out of Gaza and a permanent ceasefire. So Hamas has fought this whole war, exposed all of [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=469.03999999999996s)]
*  its people basically, to get back to where it was on the day before the war. Now all of that said, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=475.52s)]
*  Israel's response from day one by Netanyahu has been the most incoherent, inconceivable war I [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=484.8s)]
*  imagine. They have fought a war, Mike, for over a year and a half without still defining an endgame. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=491.6s)]
*  They won't do that because there are only three possible endgames. Permanent Israeli occupation, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=498.24s)]
*  the Israeli public is not up for that. It would be possibly costly, both morally and financially. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=503.12s)]
*  Partnering with the Palestinian Authority to create a new structure to replace Hamas, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=509.68s)]
*  Netanyahu won't do that because the right wing and his government will throw him out if he does. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=514.64s)]
*  Or turning Gaza into Mogadishu, a kind of land of vast warlords. And Netanyahu to this day refuses [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=518.88s)]
*  to choose between those three because his own political future depends on keeping the war going. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=527.12s)]
*  It is one of the most disgusting things I've ever seen, a leader putting his own political future [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=533.12s)]
*  ahead of the fate of the hostages and the future of his own country. And he needs to be called out [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=539.92s)]
*  for that. It is shameful. Tom, let's turn you to domestic matters now and the so-called one big, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=546.88s)]
*  beautiful bill. It has received a fair amount of criticism. We talked at the top of the show [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=552.96s)]
*  as to what it would mean for the nation's potential long-term fiscal health. Elon Musk, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=558.96s)]
*  who up until a few weeks ago was basically co-president, has turned into a sharp critic [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=563.28s)]
*  of this bill with real concerns. Give us your sense as to what worries you about the track [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=569.12s)]
*  that these Republicans in Congress have created, a glide path for Trump's agenda here. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=576.5600000000001s)]
*  If you start out with the principle that if you don't know where you're going, any road will get [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=584.0s)]
*  you there, that's this bill. How should we be doing policy today? I want to take you back. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=588.16s)]
*  20 years ago I was in Singapore, I was interviewing a central banker there. He said, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=593.92s)]
*  you Americans, he said, we Singaporeans, we live in a thatched hut. We feel every change of wind, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=597.44s)]
*  every change of temperature, and we quickly adapt to it. You Americans, it's like you live in a [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=604.16s)]
*  brick house where you don't care whatever is going on outside, no doors, no windows. What do I mean [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=608.4s)]
*  by that? If you're going to do a big, beautiful bill, the first thing you have to do is say, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=613.52s)]
*  what world am I living in? What are the big trends in this world? My answer to that would be two [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=618.72s)]
*  things. One is we're moving from an industrial age ecosystem built on combustion engines, coal, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=624.24s)]
*  oil, and gas, to a 21st century ecosystem built on batteries, electric vehicles, robots, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=631.04s)]
*  autonomous vehicles, and artificial intelligence. That's the world that we're basically going into. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=640.88s)]
*  What do you need to thrive in that world? You need basically to electrify the whole economy. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=647.04s)]
*  That means you need basically EVs. You need all the kind of power you can get. I'm for all of the [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=652.0s)]
*  above, by the way. If it's an AI world, you want to be attracting the best intellectual brain power [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=657.2s)]
*  in the world. What is Trump's policy in this? It's what I call, first of all, right-wing woke on EV. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=663.6s)]
*  Oh, EV, electric vehicles? No, no, no. That's for sissies. Real men don't do that. We're just going [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=670.0s)]
*  to get rid of EVs at a time when China is about to take over that industry in the world. It's [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=674.96s)]
*  basically throw every science, technology graduate he can find out of the country and destroy as many [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2Ojimd2xk&t=680.72s)]
