# Hegseth threatened polygraph test over leak of classified briefing for Musk: WSJ
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [April 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI)
*  Sources tell NBC News Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's behavior has become erratic, and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=0.0s)]
*  he's focusing more on public appearances in an effort to show the president that he is [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=5.28s)]
*  a fighter. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=9.48s)]
*  Officials say there is a tense environment in the Pentagon with disputes and even yelling [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=10.92s)]
*  among Hegseth's senior staff. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=15.0s)]
*  This comes amid a slew of controversies. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=17.18s)]
*  The White House has dismissed all of this. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=19.36s)]
*  Two U.S. officials say President Trump spoke to Hegseth over the phone after the New York [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  times revealed the secretary disclosed military plans in two different signal group chats, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=26.2s)]
*  one of which included his wife and his brother. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=31.32s)]
*  The sources say the president made clear to Hegseth he did not approve, calling his use [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=33.64s)]
*  of signal, quote, childish. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=38.24s)]
*  One official says the phone call ended with Trump telling Hegseth to keep fighting. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=40.86s)]
*  According to the Wall Street Journal, when news broke about Elon Musk possibly attending [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=44.8s)]
*  a classified briefing on China, Hegseth reportedly accused several people of the leak, including [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=48.74s)]
*  his then acting chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=55.040000000000006s)]
*  Two sources tell the Journal Hegseth shouted at Admiral Christopher Grady, threatening [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=57.92s)]
*  to quote, hook him up to a polygraph, marking what the Journal calls a turning point in [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=62.88s)]
*  an already rocky tenure. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=68.28s)]
*  Let's bring one of the reporters on that Wall Street Journal Peace National Security correspondent [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=71.04s)]
*  for the Wall Street Journal, Nancy Yousef. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=74.80000000000001s)]
*  Nancy, good morning. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=77.04s)]
*  Great to have you back with us. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=78.12s)]
*  So a lot of rich detail in your piece this morning for the Journal. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=79.12s)]
*  I guess the question is, how long can this go on? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=83.6s)]
*  Pete Hegseth clearly scrambling, trying to save his reputation, save his image, save [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=87.8s)]
*  his job, sending signals to the president with notable media appearances, including [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=92.56s)]
*  a long interview a couple of days ago on Fox News. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=96.75999999999999s)]
*  How long is he for this job? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=100.67999999999999s)]
*  Well, he so far continues to have the support of the president who has said that he's backed [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=102.8s)]
*  these charges a waste of time to discuss and that he still has the president's backing [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=108.92s)]
*  because I think the president sees someone who is really focused on how the president [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  receives him. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=121.6s)]
*  He's focused on the war fighter getting rid of DEI, some of the things that the president's [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=122.6s)]
*  interested in. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=126.44s)]
*  But there are other constituencies, including the Hill. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=127.44s)]
*  We will find out more next week in terms of where he stands on Capitol Hill because legislators [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=131.16s)]
*  were out this week. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=135.48000000000002s)]
*  It'll be particularly interesting what Senator Wicker, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=137.24s)]
*  Committee has to say as he was key to Hegseth's confirmation. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=140.8s)]
*  And then within the building itself is a constituency in that there's a real climate of dysfunction, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=145.44s)]
*  frankly, as people are trying to navigate a building in which they're seeing a frequent [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=152.68s)]
*  turnover among their leadership, fear about what they can and can't do, and an uncertainty [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=157.56s)]
*  about how to conduct themselves in such a way that doesn't cross wires with the secretary. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=164.92s)]
*  And it sounds like the planned briefing, as I mentioned, of Elon Musk on China really [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=169.32s)]
*  infuriated the president and was maybe a turning point here. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=176.88s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=181.11999999999998s)]
*  Because I think one of the most important people that Hegseth is looking at is the president. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=182.11999999999998s)]
*  And that was the first time he had really sort of drawn the ire of the White House. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=186.64s)]
*  And so in pursuit of figuring out who was behind that leak, he made a lot of accusations [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=192.16s)]
*  in the building, went up to senior military officers, including the then acting chairman [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=198.02s)]
*  of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=202.24s)]
*  Remember that the chairman, C.Q. Brown, had been fired a few weeks earlier and threatened [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=203.74s)]
*  to polygraph them. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  To be clear, he did not polygraph them. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=209.24s)]
*  But you can imagine the kind of climate that creates when we're threatening senior military [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=211.04s)]
*  officers with polygraph that shows a sort of level of distress. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=215.66s)]
*  And from there, we started to see a secretary that became more and more concerned about [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=220.0s)]
*  who was revealing information. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=224.28s)]
*  He already had a small coterie of staffers around him because he'd gotten rid of so many [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=226.8s)]
*  long time Pentagon employees when he arrived to the Pentagon. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=231.48000000000002s)]
*  And so now we're in a building where the staffing is quite, quite small. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=236.42000000000002s)]
*  And because of it, you're seeing a secretary who appears to almost be isolated from the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=242.12s)]
*  rest of the building. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=247.52s)]
*  And I think we're at a point now where we'll start to see a rebuild of that staff, what [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=249.35999999999999s)]
*  it looks like, and whether he can sort of reset the relationship within the building [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=251.8s)]
*  is yet to be seen. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=256.62s)]
*  But that March 21st meeting with Elon Musk and the reports that that was happening really [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=257.62s)]
*  sort of started to unravel the relationship between the secretary and the higher ranking [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=263.08s)]
*  military officers and even some of his own staff who he brought in to the building. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=270.08s)]
*  Nancy, it's Richard Haass here. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=275.48s)]
*  Amidst all this turbulence and all this theater, whatever you want to call it, the purging [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=276.8s)]
*  of the generals and admirals, the unraveling of the staff, what's actually going on in [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=281.64000000000004s)]
*  terms of policy? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=285.52000000000004s)]
*  This guy's been in the job for nearly 100 days. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=287.1s)]
*  What has he done? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=290.16s)]
*  What has he done about pivoting to Asia? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=291.16s)]
*  What has he done about U.S. forces, about the budget, about new technologies? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=293.12s)]
*  What is the, what if any impact has he had substantively on U.S. defense policy and national [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=297.88s)]
*  security? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=302.52000000000004s)]
*  I'm so glad you asked the question because that is the ultimate impact of all of this [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=303.52s)]
*  is on national security. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=307.28s)]
*  When we're talking about whether there's a makeup room or who's been fired this week, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=308.71999999999997s)]
*  we're not talking about key national security issues. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=313.59999999999997s)]
*  I would note that the U.S. has been doing strikes in Yemen every day since March 15th. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=316.0s)]
*  The Yemenis have said that the U.S. has damaged hospitals, killed civilians. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=320.02s)]
*  We have yet to get any detailed breakdown in terms of how many strikes have been conducted, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=324.64s)]
*  what has been hit, at what cost, and where the U.S. is in the mission. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=329.76s)]
*  So the ultimate impact is that we're not talking about what's happening in Yemen, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=332.78s)]
*  what U.S. support in Ukraine could look like, military budgets, what the pivot towards threats [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=338.7s)]
*  from Asia could look like because everything is so focused on sort of the dynamics within [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=343.08s)]
*  the building. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=346.64s)]
*  Nancy, I think that Washington assumes Hague says it's not going to serve four years as [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=347.64s)]
*  Secretary of Defense and maybe not four more weeks, that in the short term he's going to [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=351.5s)]
*  be replaced. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=355.94s)]
*  If that happens either next week or in six months, who are the names that would drop [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=357.94s)]
*  like the replacement? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=364.78s)]
*  And who could also get through Senate confirmation, which was no easy task the last time around? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=366.82s)]
*  It's sort of the parlor talk within the building, how long does he last and who comes in next. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=372.82s)]
*  You're absolutely right. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=376.98s)]
*  And we're starting to hear rumored names. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=378.22s)]
*  I wouldn't say anything confirmed. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=379.58s)]
*  I think among the names we've heard are, to your point, people like Secretary of Army [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=381.58s)]
*  Dan Driscoll because he's already been confirmed. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=386.94s)]
*  We've heard names like Bridge Colby, who was just confirmed as Under Secretary for Defense [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=389.94s)]
*  Policy. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=394.5s)]
*  So those are sort of internal names. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=395.5s)]
*  But we've also heard talk about looking at industry and other parts of the sort of national [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=396.98s)]
*  security apparatus to find names. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=401.46000000000004s)]
*  I think what will be interesting too is this someone who is more loyal to sort of the MAGA [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=403.5s)]
*  message as Hegseth has been or more sort of hawkish in terms of defense policy. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=408.94s)]
*  Will they make a shift there too or is the president really looking at someone who's [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=416.86s)]
*  above all loyal to the MAGA message? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=421.02s)]
*  National security correspondent for the Wall Street Journal, Nancy Yousef, her new piece [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=424.7s)]
*  you can read this morning at the Journal's website. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=428.3s)]
*  Nancy, thanks so much. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=430.74s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=431.74s)]
*  Still ahead on... [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJFj0BR1rRI&t=432.74s)]
