# What New York, New Jersey and Virginia races say about Democrats
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI)
*  Mara and David both have pieces looking at the future of the Democratic Party. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=0.0s)]
*  Okay, so we figure since we're gonna have like intramural battles here. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=6.48s)]
*  We're gonna talk about intramural battles going on in the Republican Party. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=12.24s)]
*  Let's talk about the intramural battles going on in the Democratic Party right now. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=15.92s)]
*  And Mara, I'll go to you right now before we get to the governors, which is sort of [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=20.48s)]
*  the good news, I think, for the Democratic Party. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=24.68s)]
*  But the mayor's race in New York City is gonna take center stage. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=28.08s)]
*  You've got Andrew Cuomo seen as, you know, the old guard. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=31.56s)]
*  And you've got other candidates who are seen as too far left. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=36.839999999999996s)]
*  You say Cuomo's candidacy itself is a symptom of the bigger Democratic Party right now. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=42.36s)]
*  Tell us about it. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=48.959999999999994s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, first of all, we have something extraordinary happening in New York. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=49.959999999999994s)]
*  The city may have a reputation outside of New York as a liberal bastion, but actually [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=53.72s)]
*  it's known for electing mostly centrist mayors. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=58.92s)]
*  There have been exceptions on both sides through really sleepy campaigns. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=61.68s)]
*  And right now we're actually experiencing something stunning, which is that a Democratic [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=66.52s)]
*  socialist far left candidate, Zoran Mnibani, has won, appears to be on track to win about [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=71.48s)]
*  30% of the vote. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=78.2s)]
*  So this is really a look, this piece, at why that is. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=80.6s)]
*  And what I actually found is that Mamdani is not only winning far left voters, he's [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=84.75999999999999s)]
*  eating deep into the base of the Democratic Party's establishment. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=91.24s)]
*  In moneyed neighborhoods, you're seeing his signs in brownstones that are worth millions [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=95.5s)]
*  of dollars, and also in working class New York. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=101.75999999999999s)]
*  And the reason is because when you talk to voters on the street, and when you live in [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=105.8s)]
*  New York, which I do, you know, there is a group of Democrats, including Andrew Cuomo, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=110.84s)]
*  and he's a real standard bearer for this, I would argue, who have held onto power by [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=116.32s)]
*  stomping out competition, by using really big name recognition, but haven't really delivered [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=120.72s)]
*  for their constituents. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=127.24s)]
*  And they've delivered for some of them, but there's a broad base of the Democratic Party, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=129.2s)]
*  including just young professionals and older people who want to see more fight against [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=133.72s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=138.6s)]
*  And they are very angry at the Democratic Party establishment. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=139.8s)]
*  So in some ways, Cuomo's entry into this race has made it hard for other candidates who [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=142.8s)]
*  are consensus builders, like Brad Lander, to get noticed. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=147.56s)]
*  And then it's also made it really easy for a lot of Democratic voters to be angry enough [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=151.16s)]
*  to reject a consensus candidate and say, you know what, no one's listening to me. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=157.12s)]
*  I don't think it's radical to have free childcare or free buses, things that Mom Donnie is running [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=161.12s)]
*  on. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=166.92s)]
*  So we're about to see something extraordinary. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=167.92s)]
*  Mom Donnie is within one political upset of potentially winning this primary, which is [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=170.12s)]
*  still Cuomo's to lose. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=174.8s)]
*  Yeah, and of course, you look at the options, David Drucker in New York City, and there [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=176.76s)]
*  are a lot of Democrats on both sides who would say this represents some of the Democratic [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=184.48s)]
*  Party's biggest fears. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=190.32s)]
*  You look at the gubernatorial candidates that you're writing about, Mikey Sherrill out of [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=192.0s)]
*  New Jersey, Abigail Spanberger out of Virginia. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=197.72s)]
*  I mean, if you ask AI to give you two perfect Democratic candidates running for [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=201.6s)]
*  governors in states that shouldn't be swing states, but became swing states in 2024, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=210.68s)]
*  I got a feeling you would come up with those two candidates. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=216.96s)]
*  Talk about why they give Democrats a reason to cheer. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=219.76s)]
*  Well, look, if you're a Democrat and you're concerned or exasperated because you weren't not [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=223.92s)]
*  only did you not win a presidential election last last year, but you weren't able to beat a [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=230.0s)]
*  very flawed candidate, then you're trying to figure out what it is about the party's appeal [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=235.12s)]
*  that didn't work. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=241.72s)]
*  And usually, Joe, we talk so much about messaging and ads and that stuff can matter. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=243.2s)]
*  But this stuff really is simple. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=249.56s)]
*  Find a compelling candidate that people like and believe. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=252.16s)]
*  And even if they don't agree with them all the time, they at least think they're being true to who [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=256.6s)]
*  they are. And what you have in Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and Mikey Sherrill in New [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=259.96000000000004s)]
*  Jersey are to what I would say is totally moderate. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=264.72s)]
*  They're voting records, I think, for Democratic voters are just fine on a lot of the hot button [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=268.56s)]
*  political issues. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=272.2s)]
*  But they present for a broad audience is totally moderate as as welcoming and open. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=273.96s)]
*  And then they've just got good qualities. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=280.52s)]
*  Right. I mean, they're from the suburbs, they're military veterans. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=283.0s)]
*  Spanberger, a CIA clandestine officer, Mikey Sherrill, a Navy helicopter pilot. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=286.36s)]
*  And they focus on local issues and just issues that Democratic voters generally, but [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=291.12s)]
*  voters overall care about. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=297.88s)]
*  One of the issues Democrats have had is that Democratic politicians often will focus on, you know, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=300.48s)]
*  abortion rights and things like that. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=309.6s)]
*  And what voters are consumed by right now is affordability and public safety and other local issues. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=311.92s)]
*  And what these two candidates have done is talk about the things that are top of mind for voters right now, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=319.24s)]
*  not just things that are generally in the menu of things that Democrats believe. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=325.72s)]
*  And that is key. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=331.0s)]
*  Just one last thing. When I look at the messaging from these two candidates, they talk [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=332.36s)]
*  relentlessly about affordability and then only occasionally they'll mention, by the way, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=337.08000000000004s)]
*  I'll stand up to Trump as opposed to Trump, Trump, Trump and oh, by the way, affordability. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=341.92s)]
*  And that is key. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=346.68s)]
*  That is that is key. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=349.24s)]
*  Donald Trump will not be on the ballot again in the future. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=351.32s)]
*  And Democrats need to figure out a way forward winning without just focusing on Donald Trump. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=355.28s)]
*  And you are so right. That is so important. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=360.55999999999995s)]
*  You lead with affordability. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=362.67999999999995s)]
*  You lead with the struggles of working Americans. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=364.03999999999996s)]
*  And that's how you move forward. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=367.32s)]
*  I also I want to underline something, Mike Barnicle, that David just said is so critically [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=369.2s)]
*  important. And I don't think a lot of politicians understand this. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=375.28s)]
*  The medium is the message. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=378.47999999999996s)]
*  And Marshall, as Marshall McLuhan said, the medium is the message. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=381.03999999999996s)]
*  The candidate is the message. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=384.96s)]
*  They don't sort through bios. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=387.08s)]
*  They don't sort through, you know, their positions on a lot of issues unless they're [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=389.0s)]
*  really way out there. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=393.03999999999996s)]
*  It's you know, there's so many times I would walk into a room and three minutes after [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=394.79999999999995s)]
*  it's in the room, I just look around and go, OK, I got this. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=399.32s)]
*  I'm going to be fine. There are times, Meek and I would walk in the room, should look [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=402.28s)]
*  around, you go, you just keep quiet and let me talk. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=405.91999999999996s)]
*  This is not your room. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=408.88s)]
*  It's a if you've got the right candidate to match the room, to match the community, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=409.84000000000003s)]
*  to match the district, to match the state, the church, then everything else is secondary. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=415.44s)]
*  And these two candidates in New Jersey and Virginia certainly look like they fit that [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=420.52s)]
*  bill. Yeah, so I certainly agree with that. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=426.16s)]
*  But what's what's really interesting and what Mara and David were talking about is what [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=428.72s)]
*  happens to Democrats who go to Washington, D.C. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=434.28000000000003s)]
*  Seemingly, they lose their focus on things that are really important to voters. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=438.0s)]
*  And I call it the three S's schools, safety and the third S. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=442.56s)]
*  I forget what it is. Chopping, you know, that's what it is. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=447.72s)]
*  It's how people need their lives. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=451.68s)]
*  They're interested in their children going to public schools. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=454.28000000000003s)]
*  What kind of an education are they going to get? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=457.0s)]
*  They're interested in public safety. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=459.0s)]
*  They don't want to defund the police. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=460.44s)]
*  They want more and better police. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=461.8s)]
*  They want chopping. They want to be able to go and buy groceries that are [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=463.84000000000003s)]
*  affordable and not break the bank coming out of a grocery store and missing a mortgage [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=466.96s)]
*  payment because of the cost of groceries. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=471.84s)]
*  These are simple, basic things. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=473.84s)]
*  This is how Americans live. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=475.68s)]
*  You go to Washington as a member of Congress or a member of the United States Senate as a [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=477.68s)]
*  Democrat and something happens. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=481.84s)]
*  You lose your focus on what's truly important out there. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=484.88s)]
*  I wish it was that simple, but it's not a simple landscape. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=489.35999999999996s)]
*  I mean, you've got such divisions even in the media of what even the truth is. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=492.64000000000004s)]
*  I think that Democrats are up against a very uphill battle. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Bk__tI8lI&t=497.64000000000004s)]
