# We should be planning for Iran's response: Retired Lt. Gen Mark Hertling
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8)
*  more now at the military consequences of this and bring in retired U.S. Army Lieutenant General [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=0.0s)]
*  Mike Mark Hurtling. His military career of course spans more than three decades of service, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=4.24s)]
*  including as the commanding general of the U.S. Army Europe and the Seventh Army General. Thank [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=8.88s)]
*  you very much for joining us. I mean, let's just start. Now we are two days in. Obviously, we don't [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=13.76s)]
*  have all of the information. We're going to have to be assessing the damage. But what are you looking [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  at this morning in terms of the military component of this, how the operation went? And to Kareem's [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=22.0s)]
*  point, what are the things that you're worried about, including that uranium that we don't know [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=27.2s)]
*  where it is? Okay, I'll start off by saying, complimenting you on whoever you're talking to [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=31.84s)]
*  about wars can't be short or know what's going to happen. What I'd say is in any kind of military [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  action, you're looking at three things. The action, the reaction by the enemy, and then the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=43.599999999999994s)]
*  counteraction, what you're going to do first. You and Jonathan Lemire both pointed out early this [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  morning that this is, first of all, hope is not a method. I think you said that in international [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=53.84s)]
*  relations and the enemy gets a vote. Jonathan said that. How much damage has been done? What will the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  Iranians do? What is the next thing we will do in terms of our counteraction? Those are all the things [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  that the military considers and should be part of the planning. What I'm very concerned about is it [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  doesn't seem like this has been a long-term plan by the administration. Everyone is suggesting it's [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=77.60000000000001s)]
*  one and done, that we didn't mean to start a war. This was not a war against Iran. It most definitely [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=83.75999999999999s)]
*  is by international law because you're attacking another country with 125 aircraft and a bunch of [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=89.83999999999999s)]
*  Tomahawk missiles from submarines. That seems like an attack to me, and it seems like the start of a [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=96.24s)]
*  war. So what we're seeing is the reaction phase from Iran. What will they do next? Will it be today, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=101.44s)]
*  or will it be next week or next year, as has been pointed out? They have many options. There are [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=109.28s)]
*  some that say Iran depends on missiles, militias, and terrorists, but they also have more in their [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=115.6s)]
*  kit bag, such as asymmetric attacks with cyber. That's my biggest concern. With sleeper cells, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=121.76s)]
*  that's also a big concern. With what they might do in the Gulf to the 40,000 U.S. troops positioned [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=128.24s)]
*  in various locations around the Gulf. What might they do with economic issues, turning ships around [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=135.2s)]
*  from the oil refineries? All of those things are options that Iran has. Not all of them are good [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=143.04s)]
*  options, but they can play them. I'm not sure that the U.S. government has talked about the what-ifs. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=150.39999999999998s)]
*  What I mean by that is in the planning cycle, you always say, what if this happens? What if [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=158.56s)]
*  they do this? How do we then counteract that? So with a lot of talk over the weekend after the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=164.72s)]
*  strike, a pretty good strike, actually a very brilliant kinetic strike by a lot of forces, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=172.48s)]
*  the question now becomes is do we use diplomacy, more military actions, more economic sanctions, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=179.04s)]
*  more information warfare? How do we get allies involved that aren't going to be too readily [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=185.2s)]
*  available based on what the president has done to many of our allies in the past? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=190.4s)]
*  And how do we bring the information on the world stage to counter all of this? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=195.84s)]
*  Those are all of my concerns. Right. So General, and we've talked about this before, I remember [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=200.88s)]
*  hearing your commentary as Russian troops were moving toward Ukraine, and you commented on [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=207.36s)]
*  what a ragtag operation it was, even moving their tanks and divisions into position, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  going through towns with a lack of discipline. Now go to the other side of that coin, and you [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=218.4s)]
*  talked about what a brilliant strike it was. Talk about the U.S. military and how it really does. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=224.96s)]
*  It stands—this is not cheerleading on my part. I think any military person in the world would [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=232.48000000000002s)]
*  say the same thing. The United States and its capabilities and its power and its discipline [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  right now certainly seems to be second to none. It is, Joe. It's awesome. The power of the military, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=246.16s)]
*  the power of the people in the military is incredible. We can do anything we're asked to do. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=254.8s)]
*  The question then becomes, though, much like the Ukraine-Russian war that you just talked about, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=261.04s)]
*  is what's the support for the military? Does the military trust the government? Do the people in [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=265.44s)]
*  the country trust the military? Those are the things that I'm concerned about right now. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=271.76s)]
*  When you go to war, when you conduct an attack like this, Congress isn't involved. The vote of [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=276.88s)]
*  the individual congressman is not important. What is important is that that vote represents [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=282.15999999999997s)]
*  what the people feel and how they support a military action. So that combination of the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=288.0s)]
*  so-called Clausewitzian trilogy of the strength of the military, the trust in the government, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=293.92s)]
*  and the support of the people is a three-legged triangle. And all three of those legs have to be [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=300.0s)]
*  in place for great military operations. So yeah, we've got a great military. Are the people behind [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=306.08s)]
*  us and is the government doing the right things are the things that I'm looking at. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=312.08s)]
*  All right, retired U.S. Army Lieutenant General Mark Hurdling, as always, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=317.2s)]
*  thank you so much. We greatly appreciate you being here. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=321.52s)]
*  Thanks, Joe. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=324.48s)]
*  you [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjRCpU9wSE8&t=330.0s)]
