# 'Step in the right direction': Trump officials holding trade talks with China
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk)
*  Trump officials will travel to Switzerland. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=0.0s)]
*  We're now learning later this week to hold trade talks with Chinese officials. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=2.2800000000000002s)]
*  Treasury Secretary Scott Besson confirmed the trip last night during an appearance on Fox News. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=5.78s)]
*  It will be the first formal meeting between the two countries since President Trump raised tariffs on Chinese imports to 145 percent just over a month ago. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=10.88s)]
*  Last night, Secretary Besson downplayed the likelihood of any deal, though, being reached. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=20.32s)]
*  Look, we have shared interest that this isn't sustainable, as I said before, especially on the Chinese side. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=26.72s)]
*  And, you know, 145 percent, 125 percent is the equivalent of an embargo. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  We don't want to decouple. What we want is fair trade. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=40.92s)]
*  My sense is that this will be about de-escalation, not about the big trade deal. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=44.44s)]
*  And but we've got to de-escalate before we can move forward. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=51.4s)]
*  Meanwhile, President Trump says the United States does not need to sign trade deals. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=56.84s)]
*  That's what he told reporters yesterday at the White House after weeks of promising deals with dozens of countries. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=60.92s)]
*  We also have a situation because everyone says, when, when, when are you going to sign deals? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=68.88s)]
*  We don't have to sign deals. We could sign 25 deals right now, Howard, if we wanted. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=73.36s)]
*  We don't have to sign deals. They have to sign deals with us. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=79.16s)]
*  They want a piece of our market. We don't want a piece of their market. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=81.76s)]
*  We don't care about their market. They want a piece of our market. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=85.04s)]
*  You keep writing about deals, deals. When are we going to sign? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=88.24000000000001s)]
*  When it's very simple. We're going to say, in some cases, we want you to open up your country. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=90.92s)]
*  In some cases, we want you to drop your tariffs. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=97.24000000000001s)]
*  They're going to pay for the privilege of being able to shop in the United States of America. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=99.72s)]
*  It's very simple. It's very simple. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=106.2s)]
*  So I wish that keep, you know, stop asking how many deals are you signing this week? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=108.32000000000001s)]
*  Because one day we'll come and we'll give you 100 deals and they don't have to sign. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=113.84s)]
*  All they have to do is say, oh, we'll start sending our ships right now to pick up whatever we want or to bring whatever we want. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  It's very, very simple. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  So, Jonathan Lemire, as we've been talking about for several weeks now, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=128.44s)]
*  the entire rationale for these tariffs coming from the president and the Trump administration was to negotiate deals. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=131.12s)]
*  In other words, we're going to throw a 145 percent tariff on China to get them to the table so we can negotiate deals. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=137.48s)]
*  He's saying you have to take this short term pain consumer. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  There will be inflation coming consumer. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=146.83999999999997s)]
*  You have to get only two dollars and not thirty dollars consumer because we're getting ready to make these deals that will benefit you in the long run. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=148.76s)]
*  So what is he talking about there yesterday in the Oval Office? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=156.72s)]
*  Well, on this conclave day, I'm definitely John the third or maybe John the lesser. Who knows? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=159.83999999999997s)]
*  Nice. I'll certainly take a backseat to the others here. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=164.64s)]
*  This is more than anything. This is going to be more confusion and uncertainty. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=168.4s)]
*  So a few things here. First of all, President Trump for days now has been saying that the U.S. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=172.12s)]
*  government has been talking to the Chinese beginning trade negotiations. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=177.48s)]
*  None of that was true. You know, he was contradicted day after day by his leading officials, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=181.84s)]
*  including his Treasury secretary, saying, no, that hadn't been the case. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=187.68s)]
*  Bess said yesterday morning flat out, no, we haven't talked to the Chinese yet. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=190.44s)]
*  Now there is this meeting set for this weekend in Switzerland. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=194.32s)]
*  Now it's a preliminary one. I don't think anyone anticipates a deal being struck that moment, but at least it's a step in the right direction. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=197.72s)]
*  But you counter that with what we heard from the president yesterday in that Oval Office meeting as he sat alongside the prime minister of Canada talking about, well, maybe we don't need deals. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=203.84s)]
*  Our economy is so strong. Would you just play the sound? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=212.95999999999998s)]
*  And all that's going to do is further royal markets potentially, but also plant seeds of doubt among business leaders who don't know where to invest, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=216.6s)]
*  who don't know what to do. Consumers confidence, which you've already seen plunge. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=224.0s)]
*  Well, that stuff's not going to help. So I'm I'm told that, yes, with a few countries, there has been some progress made, but relatively small steps. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=228.2s)]
*  And China looms as the big one and that China Beijing has taken a tough stance to this point simply by meeting the U.S. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=237.72s)]
*  with silence. So it's a step in the right direction because they will have first meetings this weekend. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=244.44s)]
*  But deals don't appear to be close. And certainly none have been done just yet. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=249.88s)]
*  This period of uncertainty lives on as this pause that the president initiated a few weeks ago. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=253.8s)]
*  You know, the clock is ticking. What happens next? That remains an open question. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=260.04s)]
*  No one seems to know. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amr_OlChDkk&t=263.88s)]
