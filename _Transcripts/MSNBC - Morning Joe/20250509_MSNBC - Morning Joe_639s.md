# Pope Leo celebrates first mass at the Sistene Chapel
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU)
*  What a headline. Nobody in our lifetime expected to see this. An American pope. And here's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=0.0s)]
*  the Wall Street Journal. And again, their view of it again, just absolutely incredible. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=12.34s)]
*  Pope from US elected. Really, you know, Jack was at school and asking, they were watching [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=19.18s)]
*  everything. And he said, who are the possibilities? And I sent him five possibilities. I said, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=30.259999999999998s)]
*  look for these five cardinals, these possibilities. There was one more that the New York Times [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=40.42s)]
*  had put in there, and it was actually the pope that actually became Pope Leo. But I said, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=45.86s)]
*  you know, I'm not going to waste this time with an American pope. There is no way the cardinals [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=53.1s)]
*  will ever elect someone from America. And then it really it was an extraordinarily epic day, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=58.7s)]
*  not because he's from America, but it was such a shock. And also because this is a pope who [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=67.54s)]
*  actually has read the red letters of the Gospels and lives by them, believes in them, that Jesus [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=77.02000000000001s)]
*  said, you know, he's for everyone. He is especially for the poor and the needy and those without hope [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=85.9s)]
*  is the Church of Jesus Christ that is supposed to bring hope to the hopeless, feed the poor, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=96.22s)]
*  give water to the thirsty. And it happened yesterday against all odds, really, an American pope. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=102.53999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, extraordinary. And the conventional wisdom was this would not be the choice for good reason, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=111.7s)]
*  because obviously, there's never been an American pope. For all the reasons we've talked about over [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=119.74s)]
*  the last several weeks that it's viewed as too much concentration of power for one country in the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=124.42s)]
*  world. But there, when the curtains parted and the door opened on St. Peter's balcony, there walked [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=129.22s)]
*  out a man from Chicago, grew up in the south suburbs of Chicago, a White Sox fan, as confirmed [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=135.38s)]
*  by his brother yesterday, did, as we heard there a minute ago, go to Villanova, class of 1977. His [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=141.62s)]
*  brother reports that he does the wordel every day on the New York Times. He's, to put it short, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=148.1s)]
*  one of us. And now he is the Holy Father. So Chris Jansing, we all were glued to the coverage [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=154.22s)]
*  yesterday. You were on the air. You were in the anchor chair when, when Pope Leo stepped out onto [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=160.22s)]
*  that balcony, shocked the world and then riveted and excited America that our country now has its [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=167.42000000000002s)]
*  pope. It's extraordinary. I had spent quite a bit of time during the funeral for Pope Francis talking [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=174.22s)]
*  to folks in Rome, insiders, many of whom mentioned him, but always after saying why he would make a [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=180.86s)]
*  great pope ended to a person with, but he's an American, which brings us to what has now become [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=187.82000000000002s)]
*  a famous quote that he's the least American of the American Cardinals. But I think there's a lot [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=193.9s)]
*  more than that to him, right? He is somebody who bridges a lot of different divides. Yes, he's an [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=199.58s)]
*  American, brought up the way a lot of young priests were in a Catholic household, was an altar boy. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=205.34s)]
*  In fact, there's a great story about how his friend's moms, when they were in grade school, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=212.54s)]
*  said he will be the first American pope. They said that 50 years ago. So maybe moms as usual [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=216.78s)]
*  know something, but he was also the head of the Dicastery of Bishops, which is a very powerful [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=224.22s)]
*  position. It recommends the appointment of bishops, and that is essentially saying he's the guy who [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=229.26s)]
*  looked at and determined in many ways who would lead the church into the future. Now he is ultimately [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=237.66s)]
*  the one who is going to lead it into the future. And I was listening just before I came out here. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=243.98s)]
*  He's saying his first mass right now at the Sistine Chapel. And first of all, can we talk about how [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=248.22s)]
*  shocking it is to hear a pope speak English, maybe tinged with a little bit of South Side in it? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=255.26s)]
*  And he said when he was going to make his homily, he said, I'm going to start just very briefly [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=263.98s)]
*  before going into Italian, speaking in English. And he said, you have called me to carry the cross. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=268.94s)]
*  I'm humbled to carry out the mission. And he asked for the help of cardinals. He has got a big cross [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=275.02s)]
*  to bear, a divided church, a huge financial crisis. Obviously, the wars in Gaza, he's had things to say [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=281.82s)]
*  about Russia and Ukraine, criticizing Russia, and then all the social issues we've talked about. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=290.7s)]
*  But I think the world kind of took a breath when he came out onto that loggia and saw in him [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=296.78s)]
*  somebody very relatable, speaks five languages. And as you pointed out, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=304.86s)]
*  is a deeply learned man in the gospel, somebody who has his master's degree in that before. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=310.62s)]
*  He also had undergrad in math and canon law for his PhD. So somebody who's facing a lot, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=319.58000000000004s)]
*  but seems very calm in knowing what's ahead of him. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=327.5s)]
*  Yeah, just remarkable, Chris. Your coverage yesterday of an event that was just epic. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=332.06s)]
*  And John Meacham, you know, we are so often left dizzy with just a barrage of images that [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=338.7s)]
*  assault us every day, so much so that pretty soon they all seem to blur together, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=346.86s)]
*  and we become numb by it all. Yesterday, though, yesterday afternoon, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=353.02s)]
*  um, watching what unfolded yesterday in Rome, I was struck by how many people I spoke with [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=359.5s)]
*  who just said, this was different. This this was a remarkable event. It was epic, possibly an [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=371.1s)]
*  era defining moment that we were witnessing, not because he is an American, though that certainly [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=379.66s)]
*  adds much drama and much shock to it all. But because this is a man who has devoted his life [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=386.86s)]
*  to serving the poor and is going to devote his papacy to speaking up for the poor, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=397.26s)]
*  speaking up for the immigrant, speaking up for those that Jesus said, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=405.02000000000004s)]
*  uh, we are supposed to to to to focus on first not the powerful, uh, but the hungry, the thirsty, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=411.5s)]
*  those without clothes, those left without hope. And this is a pope. And you could tell even by [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=420.94s)]
*  the name that he chose that has decided he will follow, at least in this area, in Francis's [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=430.62s)]
*  footsteps and will follow the words of Jesus Christ in the gospels. He's also an Augustinian. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=438.7s)]
*  That's his religious order. And one of the phrases, one of the many remarkable phrases [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=446.14s)]
*  that come to us through translation from St. Augustine, one of the great fathers of the church, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=452.38s)]
*  is that something can be ever ancient and ever new. And I think that's part of what was going [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=457.9s)]
*  on with the people you were talking to is when there is an election like this, when there's a [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=463.82s)]
*  moment like this, where there's a new figure in the most ancient of settings, it is renewing. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=470.14s)]
*  And there's something at once, uh, reassuring about the stability, uh, the long chain from St. Peter, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=480.22s)]
*  uh, to a White Sox fan. I don't think we've said this, but anybody who's a White Sox fan, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=488.7s)]
*  clearly, so that's an important thing, I think, to, to note, um, if you've been a Yankees fan, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=495.41999999999996s)]
*  probably would have been overweening pride. Oh, and so you can't do that. But I, I think that's [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=503.58s)]
*  part of what we're sensing is the pageantry, the powerful imagery, uh, is something that puts us [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=511.26s)]
*  all in the mind of tradition, you know, and tradition means handing on. It means something [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=522.86s)]
*  that has existed and been handed on, but with an infusion of something new and, uh, not necessarily [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=528.7s)]
*  different, but fresh. And the only other point I'd make is, I say this as a Protestant, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=537.66s)]
*  the point, one of the points of faith is that it is an outward and visible sign, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=546.6999999999999s)]
*  this is what a sacrament is defined as, an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=554.2199999999999s)]
*  And so what you see does matter, a manifestation, you know, a, a, an embodiment of something [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=561.02s)]
*  that becomes visible, but is, is invisible. And, you know, William James once said that [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=569.58s)]
*  God is real because he has real effects. I used to argue to agnostic and atheist friends that [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=576.62s)]
*  one could believe in God on the same evidence one believes in love. It's an invisible force [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=586.06s)]
*  with visible effects. And I think that a lot of this drama is what's unfolding as, uh, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=591.26s)]
*  Leo the 14th begins, what could be a long papacy. Uh, he's in, in relative terms, he's a young guy, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=597.98s)]
*  right? He's 69. We're looking at live pictures on the left side of your screen there that is [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=605.02s)]
*  inside the Sistine chapel. As Chris said, Pope Leo the 14th, delivering his first mass as Pope. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFB1baeJwsU&t=611.74s)]
