# 'Simply raising a question': WH press sec. says Trump hasn't shifted posture on regime change
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4)
*  The president's posture and our military posture has not changed. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=0.0s)]
*  The president was just simply raising a question that I think many people around the world [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=4.84s)]
*  are asking. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=8.68s)]
*  If the Iranian regime refuses to give up their nuclear program or engage in talks, we just [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=9.68s)]
*  took out their nuclear program on Saturday night, as you all know, but if they refuse [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=15.8s)]
*  to engage in diplomacy moving forward, why shouldn't the Iranian people rise up against [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=19.88s)]
*  this brutal terrorist regime? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=24.16s)]
*  That's a question the president raised last night. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=26.48s)]
*  As far as our military posture, it hasn't changed. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=28.62s)]
*  That was White House press secretary Carolyn Levitt moments ago weighing in on Donald Trump's [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=33.02s)]
*  social media post yesterday where he raised the prospect of regime change in Iran. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=37.46s)]
*  And Jonathan, we've been sharing notes this weekend on our reporting out of the White [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=42.3s)]
*  House. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=45.94s)]
*  I must say, I'll tell everybody mine and then go to yours. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=46.94s)]
*  It's certainly the impression that I got from the White House, from people extremely close [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=52.18s)]
*  to Donald Trump, was that this was a one and done, like Soleimani. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=56.26s)]
*  Unless the Iranians launch significant attacks against United States positions, this was [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=60.260000000000005s)]
*  a one and done. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=66.58s)]
*  A president's tweet later on in the day to me seemed like one of those messages being [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=68.14s)]
*  sent, which is, you know, be careful, Iran, with what you do next. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=74.5s)]
*  Based on all my reporting, based on talking to people inside the White House, it's something [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=83.53999999999999s)]
*  they underlined all weekend. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=88.14s)]
*  It's something they underlined yesterday on the Sunday shows. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=89.66s)]
*  It's something they're still underlining today. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=92.61999999999999s)]
*  This is a one and done. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=95.86s)]
*  We are going after the nuclear weapons. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=98.86s)]
*  We're not going, the program, we're not going for regime change. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=101.38s)]
*  Tell everybody about your reporting. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=107.14s)]
*  Yeah, that lines up with what I reported as well. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=108.38s)]
*  There was a media post from President Trump yesterday, more of a brush back pitch, if [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=112.34s)]
*  you will, a warning rather than a threat that we would do this. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=115.3s)]
*  And also, let's be clear, I mean, President Trump, not exactly the most disciplined messenger [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=120.66s)]
*  out there, but the rest of his administration was in lockstep yesterday. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=124.17999999999999s)]
*  They fanned that over the Sunday shows. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=127.58s)]
*  We just heard from the press secretary as well. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=129.46s)]
*  Regime change not on the agenda here for the United States, that Joe, that they do hope [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=131.38s)]
*  this was a one and done. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=136.26s)]
*  What could change things, as you noted, would be if Iran does retaliate, and particularly [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=137.86s)]
*  if there are American casualties, if there are some rockets fired, that the U.S. shoots [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=141.7s)]
*  down, maybe that's a different story, and ends right there. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=145.38s)]
*  That is what happened in January 2020. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=148.38s)]
*  When Soleimani was killed, Iran did fire, send some rockets towards the U.S. facilities. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=150.7s)]
*  They were defended for the most part, some injuries, nothing too serious, and the U.S. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=156.01999999999998s)]
*  let that lie. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=160.5s)]
*  President Trump said, OK, enough's enough. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=161.5s)]
*  That's the hope here now, but of course, only time will tell as to what really occurs. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=163.38s)]
*  Well, I will say as far as the president's messaging over the past four or five days, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=168.57999999999998s)]
*  if you talk to leaders in the region, if you talk to others, other diplomats across the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=175.57999999999998s)]
*  world, a lot of our allies will talk about how disciplined this White House was, how, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=182.62s)]
*  as you reported in The Atlantic, his two-week statement was a head fake and was meant to [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=188.74s)]
*  do exactly what it did, which is lull the Iranians into a false sense of security. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=195.9s)]
*  Yeah, it's become, truthfully, almost a running joke around Washington that when President [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=201.78s)]
*  Trump wants to just delay something or he doesn't want to deal with something, he says, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=206.42000000000002s)]
*  ah, we'll get to it in two weeks. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=209.74s)]
*  In this case, though, it was a deliberate feint that the go-ahead had already been given [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=211.46s)]
*  to be ready for this strike this weekend. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=217.18s)]
*  Two weeks' statement from President Trump meant to get Iran to relax a little bit, think [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=220.54000000000002s)]
*  they had some breathing space. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=224.73999999999998s)]
*  That was not, of course, the case. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=226.29999999999998s)]
*  We are learning more details about the strikes carried out over the weekend by the U.S. against [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=228.26s)]
*  Tehran's nuclear facilities, with Iran now vowing retaliation for the attacks. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=233.26s)]
*  NBC News senior national security correspondent Courtney Kubi has more on the secrecy of the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=238.01999999999998s)]
*  U.S. operation. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=243.73999999999998s)]
*  Following that massive attack, the question this morning, did those U.S. military strikes [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=245.94s)]
*  deliver a final blow to Iran's nuclear program? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=250.2s)]
*  Iran's nuclear ambitions have been obliterated. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=254.5s)]
*  The nation's top military official offering a more nuanced view. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=258.06s)]
*  Final battle damage will take some time, but initial battle damage assessments indicate [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=261.92s)]
*  that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=266.48s)]
*  It was just after midnight Saturday morning, U.S. Air Force stealth B-2 bombers took off [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=270.58s)]
*  from the U.S. under the cover of darkness. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=275.46s)]
*  Defense officials said they were headed to Guam, and while everyone was looking west, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=278.38s)]
*  seven bombers quietly flew in the opposite direction, straight to Iran. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=282.58s)]
*  Flying in near silence to avoid detection, the bombers began their 36-hour round-trip [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=287.02s)]
*  flight, joining up with dozens of tankers to refuel them in the air and fighter jets [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=291.85999999999996s)]
*  flying security alongside them. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=296.62s)]
*  The B-2s dropping 14 massive ordnance penetrators, 30,000-pound bombs known as Bunker Busters, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=298.9s)]
*  on Iranian nuclear sites at Fordow and Natanz, just as 30 Tomahawk missiles fired from a [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=305.73999999999995s)]
*  U.S. Navy submarine crashed down on a third site at Isfahan. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=312.26s)]
*  This operation was designed to severely degrade Iran's nuclear weapons infrastructure. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=316.53999999999996s)]
*  The question now, what comes next? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=322.09999999999997s)]
*  Vice President Vance and the defense secretary have said the U.S. is not seeking regime change [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=324.7s)]
*  in Iran. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=328.98s)]
*  But President Trump is now leaving the door open to that happening, posting, if the current [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=330.06s)]
*  Iranian regime is unable to make Iran great again, why wouldn't there be a regime change? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=335.06s)]
*  And with concerns that Iran could retaliate, some Republicans on Capitol Hill criticizing [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=340.86s)]
*  the U.S. strikes. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=345.54s)]
*  We are tired from all of these wars, and we're non-interventionists. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwvqOfsIUZ4&t=347.18s)]
