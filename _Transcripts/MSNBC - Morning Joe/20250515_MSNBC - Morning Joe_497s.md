# Joe: RFK Jr. should have said 'Yes, yes and hell yes' when questioned about vaccines
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0)
*  Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faced tough questions during two congressional hearings yesterday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=0.0s)]
*  Anybody asking about swimming in Rock Creek and the floating... [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=7.4s)]
*  You like completely submerged around him. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=12.08s)]
*  He was like diving in it. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=15.68s)]
*  And swimming in jeans. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=17.68s)]
*  Swimming in jeans. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=19.68s)]
*  The problem with swimming in jeans is that it all sticks to you for quite some time. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=21.68s)]
*  And it gets in there. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=25.68s)]
*  It's like... [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=28.36s)]
*  I hope people ask him questions there. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=30.36s)]
*  Set up shop, get to home, the bacteria, it's really something. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=32.36s)]
*  Lawmakers on the House Appropriations Committee obviously deeply disturbed by that. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=36.36s)]
*  I'm sure they were, even if they said something. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=41.36s)]
*  And the Senate Help Committee were scheduled to discuss next year's HHS budget. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=43.36s)]
*  But amid an ongoing deadly outbreak of measles and swimming in Rock Creek, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=52.04s)]
*  focus on shifted Secretary Kennedy's stance on vaccinations. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=58.04s)]
*  Now, the question is, that stance on vaccination, Willie, because I'm a simple country lawyer. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=63.04s)]
*  So I don't understand. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  When he talks about his stance, is he talking about his stance as it pertains to his online following? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  Or is he talking about his stance when the doctor says, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=81.72000000000001s)]
*  Mr. Kennedy, would you like to give your own children these vaccines? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=85.72s)]
*  Because for that he was like, yes, I do. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=89.72s)]
*  Because what if we, for instance, decide years down the road to swim in Rock Creek where there's the flu and all of the late? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=93.72s)]
*  So is it what he says for people to do or what he does for himself? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=102.72s)]
*  It's funny you should ask Joe. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=108.72s)]
*  I don't follow the news. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=111.4s)]
*  It's good to know. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=113.4s)]
*  Measles, probably for measles. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=115.4s)]
*  What I would say is my opinions about vaccines are irrelevant. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=120.4s)]
*  I don't want to seem like I'm being evasive. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=126.4s)]
*  But I don't think people should be taking advice, medical advice from me. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=128.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=133.4s)]
*  I got that. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=135.4s)]
*  And I'm not asking you to give them medical advice. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=137.4s)]
*  I'm just asking you to give them advice. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=140.08s)]
*  I don't want to question directly that it will seem like I'm giving advice to other people. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=142.08s)]
*  And I don't want to be doing that. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=146.08s)]
*  I want people to make that. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=148.08s)]
*  But that's kind of your jurisdiction because CDC does give advice. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=150.08s)]
*  Can you talk about chickenpox? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=152.08s)]
*  Would you vaccinate your child against chickenpox? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=154.08s)]
*  Again, I don't want to give advice. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=160.08s)]
*  Just one last one. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=162.08s)]
*  Just a yes or no, please. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=164.08s)]
*  Polio? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=166.08s)]
*  That's fair. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=168.76000000000002s)]
*  The answer, I'm just interpreting. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=170.76000000000002s)]
*  Okay, so I'm actually a simple caveman lawyer. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=172.76000000000002s)]
*  I do understand things better than say. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=174.76000000000002s)]
*  So those answers were yes, yes, and hell yes. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=176.76000000000002s)]
*  And yet he goes out and tells everybody not to do it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=180.76000000000002s)]
*  He's got quite a following because of it. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=184.76000000000002s)]
*  And yet he vaccinates his own children but says don't vaccinate yours. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=186.76000000000002s)]
*  Or suggests maybe you shouldn't vaccinate yours. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=190.76000000000002s)]
*  Come on. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=192.76000000000002s)]
*  What are you going to do next? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=194.76000000000002s)]
*  Rock Creek? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=197.44s)]
*  By the way, he has said in the past a few weeks ago he attended the funeral of a child who died of polio in Texas. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=199.44s)]
*  And was asked after should people be getting the polio vaccine? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=205.44s)]
*  Measles. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=208.44s)]
*  And he said yeah, you should get the measles vaccine. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=210.44s)]
*  So very evasive there yesterday. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=212.44s)]
*  As you say, he's built this entire universe around himself. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=214.44s)]
*  Around anti-vaccination. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=218.44s)]
*  I'm just asking questions. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=220.44s)]
*  All that weasley stuff. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=222.44s)]
*  He's enriched himself. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=224.44s)]
*  He's been a prominent speaker at all these events. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=227.12s)]
*  So he has to sort of keep that credibility. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=229.12s)]
*  But we know that he's vaccinating his children. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=231.12s)]
*  So what is his standing in the administration? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=233.12s)]
*  Because it seems, it's interesting. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=235.12s)]
*  The MAGA base at times in the past has been skeptical of him because he's left wing on a lot of issues. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=237.12s)]
*  But what is his standing in the administration? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=245.12s)]
*  What is his standing with President Trump? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=247.12s)]
*  We're about to find out because this is sort of his first moment in the spotlight. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=249.12s)]
*  The measles outbreak and now these hearings. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=251.12s)]
*  He was, President Trump deeply pleased with Kennedy with the endorsement and the support down the stretch of the campaign. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=253.8s)]
*  Telling people that he had a Kennedy with him. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=255.8s)]
*  That was something that really meant a lot to him in his campaign. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=257.8s)]
*  And he loves the idea of having a Kennedy. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=259.8s)]
*  Work for him as part of the cabinet. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=261.8s)]
*  You know, to this point, Kennedy has been largely relatively low profile in the first couple months. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=263.8s)]
*  That's now changing. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=265.8s)]
*  We're going to have to see how this goes. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=267.8s)]
*  I mean, this obviously was a very important moment for him. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=269.8s)]
*  But he's also been very, very supportive of the president. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=271.8s)]
*  And so he's been very supportive of the president. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=273.8s)]
*  And so he's been very supportive of the president. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=275.8s)]
*  And so he's been very supportive of the president. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=277.8s)]
*  And so he's been very supportive of the president. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=279.8s)]
*  I mean, this obviously was an absurd performance yesterday. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=282.48s)]
*  As the congressman pointed out, as Kennedy said, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=284.48s)]
*  Well, I don't want to give advice. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=286.48s)]
*  That's exactly your job. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=288.48s)]
*  You are the Health and Human Services Secretary of the CDC. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=290.48s)]
*  You give advice. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=292.48s)]
*  You give health recommendations. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=294.48s)]
*  Kennedy trying to walk a fine line. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=296.48s)]
*  We will see how that plays in the administration in the months ahead. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=298.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=300.48s)]
*  So, David, I'm not sure. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=302.48s)]
*  I do think at some point [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=304.48s)]
*  this anti-vax [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=306.48s)]
*  approach may come in conflict. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=308.48s)]
*  With Donald Trump and his understanding [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=311.16s)]
*  of what one of his great achievements [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=313.16s)]
*  have been in his two presidencies. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=315.16s)]
*  Because [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=317.16s)]
*  he understands [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=319.16s)]
*  and the people closest to him understand [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=321.16s)]
*  something that was said on the show, I think, by Ezra Klein. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=323.16s)]
*  That one of the great achievements, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=325.16s)]
*  one of the great scientific achievements [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=327.16s)]
*  over the past 50, 60 years [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=329.16s)]
*  was Operation Warp Speed. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=331.16s)]
*  Yep. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=333.16s)]
*  And the fact that they understood [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=335.16s)]
*  that the president was going to be [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=337.16s)]
*  the president of the United States, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=339.84000000000003s)]
*  the fact that they understand [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=341.84000000000003s)]
*  that that's one of the great scientific achievements [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=343.84000000000003s)]
*  but he can hardly ever talk about it [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=345.84000000000003s)]
*  because this anti-vax movement [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=347.84000000000003s)]
*  that Robert Kennedy [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=349.84000000000003s)]
*  is at the center of, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=351.84000000000003s)]
*  I just wonder at what point [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=353.84000000000003s)]
*  the deeper he goes into his presidency, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=355.84000000000003s)]
*  he doesn't start talking about it. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=357.84000000000003s)]
*  He's been so opportunistic, Joe. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=359.84000000000003s)]
*  He created [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=361.84000000000003s)]
*  through Warp Speed [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=363.84000000000003s)]
*  the mRNA vaccines that [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=365.84000000000003s)]
*  he saved a lot of lives in America. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=368.52s)]
*  He should be taking credit for it. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=370.52s)]
*  But then this anti-vax movement [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=372.52s)]
*  began to sweep the country [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=374.52s)]
*  and he seems to have just tucked himself in behind it [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=376.52s)]
*  ignoring the fact [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=378.52s)]
*  that he was [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=380.52s)]
*  in the eyes of medical professionals [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=382.52s)]
*  responsible for funding this [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=384.52s)]
*  extraordinary breakthrough. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=386.52s)]
*  I think it's going to take a real rebellion [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=388.52s)]
*  by healthcare professionals and researchers [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=390.52s)]
*  to stop this. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=392.52s)]
*  And when I say rebellion, no, not going to demonstrations [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=394.52s)]
*  but also putting pressure on the institutions [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=397.2s)]
*  that fund this. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=399.2s)]
*  We just can't practice medicine the way that we're asked to [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=401.2s)]
*  with the rules that you're instituting. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=403.2s)]
*  An early sign of conflict [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=405.2s)]
*  is that Kennedy has proposed [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=407.2s)]
*  reducing the use of pesticides. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=409.2s)]
*  The White House has pushed back on that [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=411.2s)]
*  saying, wait a minute, that could endanger food supplies, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=413.2s)]
*  that could endanger people's health. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=415.2s)]
*  So we might see more, to your point, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=417.2s)]
*  these tension moments coming up. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=419.2s)]
*  And now there's the Surgeon General [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=421.2s)]
*  of apparently very new agey [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=423.2s)]
*  like not a licensed doctor [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=425.88s)]
*  and a lot of things like that. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=427.88s)]
*  Come on, that's not her job! [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=429.88s)]
*  Oh wait, it is. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=431.88s)]
*  But now apparently some of the base [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=433.88s)]
*  not happy that her, I don't know, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=435.88s)]
*  she, I don't know, something about the moon [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=437.88s)]
*  and I don't know what... [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=439.88s)]
*  There's some woo in there. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=441.88s)]
*  She's got some good stuff. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=443.88s)]
*  When they talk about clean eating [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=445.88s)]
*  and having our children eat healthier food [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=447.88s)]
*  when Secretary Kennedy talks about that stuff [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=449.88s)]
*  she does, that's all good stuff. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=451.88s)]
*  And by the way, the other nominee [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=454.56s)]
*  to be Surgeon General was pushed out [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=456.56s)]
*  because she supported the COVID vaccine. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=458.56s)]
*  And that was fatal. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=460.56s)]
*  This is so convoluted. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=462.56s)]
*  So she supported the vaccine [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=464.56s)]
*  that Donald Trump... [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=466.56s)]
*  Correct. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=468.56s)]
*  Galvanized, major companies, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=470.56s)]
*  Operation Warp Speed. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=472.56s)]
*  Historic, yeah. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=474.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahHZsMjKV0&t=476.56s)]
