# ‘Hostile and political act’: WH blasts Amazon over plan to display tariff costs for consumers
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA)
*  And we should note also, Joe, one real takeaway here from this briefing was the news that broke [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=0.0s)]
*  just before those two took the podium, that Amazon is now going to be displaying how much of an item's [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  cost is derived from tariffs. We are seeing reports already, prices are starting to go up in [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=14.96s)]
*  certain sectors, in certain stores, certain industries. Now, Amazon is going to show you, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  if you go to their website or their app and click, and I'm going to buy this, it will show you how much [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=24.72s)]
*  you're paying because of President Trump's tariffs. The press secretary deemed that a, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=29.44s)]
*  quote, hostile and political act by Amazon. We know, of course, that Jeff Bezos, the owner of [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=34.56s)]
*  Amazon, also owns The Washington Post and other interests, has really cozied up to Trump in these [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=41.04s)]
*  first hundred days. We'll see what happens there next. And we're going to hear from the president [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=46.0s)]
*  himself later on at this rally in Michigan to mark 100 days of his term. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=49.92s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, obviously, that's just a business, it seems to me, protecting their relationship with [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=54.720000000000006s)]
*  their customers. I suspect you will see Walmart, you will see Costco, you will, I mean, you'll see [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=63.440000000000005s)]
*  other stores that are going to be explaining why prices are going up if they do, in fact, go up [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=71.60000000000001s)]
*  because of tariffs. And again, that's, again, some in the Trump White House may view that as a hostile [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=79.92s)]
*  act. It seems to me it would be exactly what everybody's been saying, Wall Street Journal [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=87.44s)]
*  editorial page and other conservative economists have been saying for years that tariffs are a [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=93.68s)]
*  hidden tax on consumers. And so that tax won't be so hidden if Amazon, Walmart, and other companies [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=99.04s)]
*  decide to show how much those prices are being increased because of tariffs. It is interesting, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=108.64s)]
*  John. Let's talk about the politics of this for a second. Yesterday, you were talking about [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=114.56s)]
*  how there were almost like wanted posters of illegal immigrants that committed violent crimes [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=120.16s)]
*  that were hung up behind the standing positions where a lot of people did their hits at the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=130.0s)]
*  White House on the fence. Done, obviously, many, well, I say obviously, many people believe done [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=137.12s)]
*  because of the low poll numbers that came out over the weekend. And so the White House trying [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=143.76s)]
*  to show Americans this is what we're doing on illegal immigration, even if you disagree [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=149.6s)]
*  with certain parts of it. Today seems to be sort of a one-two punch, right? Okay, yesterday, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  they did that to underline what they're doing on illegal immigration. Today, they bring up the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=160.88s)]
*  Treasury Secretary to try to explain why the tariff negotiations are going to go in a positive [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=165.92s)]
*  direction and to try to not only calm the markets, but also calm consumers and calm voters who may [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=173.2s)]
*  be getting, well, not maybe, if you look at the poll numbers, getting very squeamish about the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=179.83999999999997s)]
*  way these tariffs have been trotted out over the past 100 days. Yeah, that's clearly the strategy [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=185.35999999999999s)]
*  and attempt to sort of reset the narrative here. As we've talked a lot, this is the White House, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=190.23999999999998s)]
*  first couple months felt really good and they've been about how things were going. They've knocked [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=194.08s)]
*  off kilter in the last month because of Signalgate, which then had its sequel. But then, of course, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=197.60000000000002s)]
*  the economic fallout from the tariffs. So they're trying to focus in on what they think are the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=202.72000000000003s)]
*  positives from the tariffs. A lot of economists, of course, disagree. And immigration yesterday. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=208.24s)]
*  In fact, not only do they hang up those posters on the White House driveway, but Tom Holman, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=212.88000000000002s)]
*  who's head of the face of the deportation effort, the immigration crackdown, he appeared with [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=217.28s)]
*  press secretary at another 830 a.m. briefing. And now this morning, we see the Treasury Secretary [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=222.24s)]
*  do the same. And this is an attempt here as they mark 100 days, Joe, to try to turn the corner a [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  little bit. We talked a few hours back about there's no panic in the West Wing about these [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=232.4s)]
*  poll numbers, but there's not happiness either. They see the trends. They see the headlines that [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=237.36s)]
*  say that Trump has a historically low approval rating at the 100-day mark. They're looking to [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=244.24s)]
*  try to reset it and is so often, we've seen this since 2015, when Trump first took a step [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=248.96s)]
*  onto the presidential stage, his reflexive instinct, any time he wants to change the conversation, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=254.48000000000002s)]
*  you go to immigration. Yeah. And of course, inside the White House, you're hearing the same things [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=259.6s)]
*  that I'm hearing. Number one, is that he's freed up. He's not running for reelection again. So he [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=264.96000000000004s)]
*  doesn't have to worry about that, despite the fact the third term trolling does continue unabated. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=271.2s)]
*  And then the second thing they'll say is that, you know, we've got time. We prefer good poll [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=278.4s)]
*  numbers to bad poll numbers, but we think the next 100 days, we've had a lot of disruption. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=285.12s)]
*  The first 100 days, we think the second 100 days, we're going to see trade deals, we're going to see [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=291.52s)]
*  peace deals, and we're going to be seeing tax deals, reconciliation deals. So we'll see what [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=299.03999999999996s)]
*  happens. Let's bring in right now the co-anchor of CBC Squawk Box and New York Times columnist, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=307.28s)]
*  Andrew Ross Sorkin. Andrew, we've talked about the politics of it. John and I have talked about the [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=312.15999999999997s)]
*  politics of why the Treasury Secretary was out there with the White House spokesperson. I'm curious, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=317.67999999999995s)]
*  did you gain anything economically from that? Did you get any answers that might calm the fears of [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=325.76s)]
*  Wall Street or American consumers who, obviously, if you look at every poll that's out there right [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=332.64s)]
*  now, very concerned about the way the White House tariffs are going? I'm afraid to say I didn't, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=338.71999999999997s)]
*  and he has been soothing the markets by coming out and being public, though I don't think, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=345.2s)]
*  as we all saw, that there were a lot of answers. In fact, I would imagine that people are frustrated [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=350.56s)]
*  and there's sort of a disconcerting piece about what exactly is happening with these negotiations [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=355.91999999999996s)]
*  with China. It doesn't appear that there are talks going on, and it appears that he continues [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=362.16s)]
*  to say that he's not engaged in those talks himself if there are talks going on. It's odd [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=367.76000000000005s)]
*  that he can't comment specifically on these China talks. He seems to know a lot about or be willing [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=374.40000000000003s)]
*  to say that he's having talks with all these other countries, but again, we have no timeline for where [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=380.64000000000004s)]
*  this is all going to shake out, and so I think this is going to get pushed out and continue [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=386.8s)]
*  to have a sort of a volatile market as a result of it. I do think, and I wanted to make a point [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=392.0s)]
*  about the Amazon comments because I think that's going to be the next big headline of the morning. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=398.0s)]
*  First of all, I don't think we know yet exactly what this could look like on the website. This [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=403.2s)]
*  was this report from Punchbowl. I'm not suggesting it's wrong. I just think there's a question mark [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=408.72s)]
*  about how it would be, how it would manifest itself in a practical way. There is a distinction, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=414.64s)]
*  though, that's important to make between what you heard there from the White House as it relates [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=420.48s)]
*  to them saying, look, Amazon didn't do this when Biden had tariffs on, and Amazon didn't do this [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=426.0s)]
*  during the first Trump administration. That is true, but for the most part, the products that [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=433.04s)]
*  are sold on Amazon were not tariffed and not tariffed at these levels. So when you're talking [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=438.56s)]
*  about tariffs at 145%, it's going to change prices materially. The kinds of things that had been [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=443.12s)]
*  tariffed under Biden and Trump prior to this were solar panels, EV batteries, semiconductors. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=449.36s)]
*  These were not products that you and I could go on our Amazon app and buy, so this is going to be [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=456.64s)]
*  a different experience. Now, yes, this is going to be a billboard, though, for the tariffs. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=461.68s)]
*  There's no question that is what's going to happen, but I wonder whether, as a result of these comments [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=466.72s)]
*  this morning, whether Amazon will go through with it and actually whether this will silence all [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=473.12s)]
*  retailers, Walmart and anybody else who is even thinking about indicating what was going on here. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=477.52s)]
*  Now, I would think as a customer, this would agree to great transparency. You want that. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=483.28s)]
*  You want to know what's going on, but this may change that. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=487.76s)]
*  You know, Andrew, it's one thing if Jeff Bezos is trying to cozy up to Donald Trump for [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=492.32s)]
*  whatever reasons he's trying to cozy up to Donald Trump, but the first group of people he has to [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=499.84s)]
*  cozy up to are his customers. Yes. Same with Walmart. And if customers see items going up, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=506.48s)]
*  you know, 10, 15, 20, 25 percent and there's no explanation, their anchor is going to be directed [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=517.6s)]
*  at Amazon, at Walmart, at Costco, at Target. You just go down the list. So I understand the [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=524.48s)]
*  White House has been very effective in scaring some of these guys. But it's one thing having [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=531.36s)]
*  political pushback. It's quite another having it from the very people who decide whether your [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=541.36s)]
*  business succeeds or fails. I don't disagree with you. I just think that this administration [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=547.6s)]
*  has managed to scare so many businesses into silence. We've seen it over and over again. I [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=554.24s)]
*  actually mentioned it yesterday to somebody. I had a CEO tell me, I don't want to be Harvarded. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=561.36s)]
*  That was the phrase. I don't want to be Harvarded, which means basically I don't want [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=566.16s)]
*  to have to get in a lawsuit with them and them coming after me in some other way. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=570.72s)]
*  And I think that that is what worries CEOs today. So do I think that Amazon may look at this and [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=574.8s)]
*  say to themselves, OK, maybe I'm going to try to get the word out in a different way. I'm not [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=581.44s)]
*  going to poster it on each thing. Maybe. I don't know how this is all going to play out. But I do [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=585.84s)]
*  think that this administration has scared these CEOs so much that they are worried about either [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=591.2800000000001s)]
*  being regulated in some way that they don't know about. I mean, all of these businesses, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=597.9200000000001s)]
*  whether it's Walmart or Amazon or whomever, have massive relationships or rely on the government, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=602.0s)]
*  not for funding, but for allowing them to do all sorts of things. Amazon just put Kuiper, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=609.28s)]
*  which are these new satellites, into the sky in the past 24 hours. That's a very, very big deal. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=614.3199999999999s)]
*  They're going to want to be able to continue to do that. There's all sorts of things like that [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=620.24s)]
*  where they need the permission effectively of the government. And if the government tries to block [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=624.8s)]
*  them on anything, the question is, what's the risk reward as it relates to showing these prices? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=629.04s)]
*  I would think the transparency should win. But as you know, I think we've seen that, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=634.88s)]
*  unfortunately, in this day and age, transparency is all too often getting lost. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=640.0s)]
*  Yeah. That was an incredible news conference with just almost zero answers, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2v7L9ZyNwA&t=644.56s)]
