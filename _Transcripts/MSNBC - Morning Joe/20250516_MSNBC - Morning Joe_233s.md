# Comey 'should be behind bars' over social media post, says Tulsi Gabbard
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s)
*  The Secret Service and Department of Homeland Security are investigating former FBI Director [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=0.0s)]
*  James Comey after he posted a photo yesterday to social media that some are arguing could [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=5.92s)]
*  be a call to violence against the president. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=11.6s)]
*  Comey posted and then deleted this picture of shells and rocks on a beach formed to read [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=14.44s)]
*  8647. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=19.64s)]
*  The phrase 86, as you may know, is common slang used in restaurants to mean an item [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=22.0s)]
*  is sold out, so don't sell it or throw it out, get rid of it. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=26.1s)]
*  That has some Trump allies saying it proves the Post actually is a call to violence against [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=30.340000000000003s)]
*  President Trump. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=36.42s)]
*  Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem wrote on social media, both her department [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=37.42s)]
*  and the Secret Service are actively investigating the Post as a threat. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=41.82s)]
*  And Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said in an interview last night she [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=46.14s)]
*  believes the Post is enough to send Comey to prison. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=50.14s)]
*  The rule of law says people like him who issue direct threats against the president [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=55.42s)]
*  of the United States, essentially issuing a call to assassinate him, must be held accountable [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=59.82s)]
*  under the law. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=64.5s)]
*  Do you believe Comey should be in jail? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=65.5s)]
*  I do. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=67.9s)]
*  Any other person with the position of influence that he has, people who take very seriously [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=69.74000000000001s)]
*  what a guy of his stature, his experience and what the propaganda media has built him [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=76.54s)]
*  up to be, I'm very concerned for the president. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=82.1s)]
*  We've already seen assassination attempts. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=85.34s)]
*  I'm very concerned for his life. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=87.82000000000001s)]
*  And James Comey, in my view, should be held accountable and put behind bars for this. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=89.98s)]
*  That is the Director of National Intelligence saying the former FBI director should be sent [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=95.58s)]
*  to prison over this. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=99.02000000000001s)]
*  Comey responded in a statement to NBC News writing, I saw it on the beach today. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=100.30000000000001s)]
*  I didn't realize some folks associate it with violence. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=104.58000000000001s)]
*  That did not occur to me when I saw it, but I'm opposed to violence in all circumstances, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=107.34s)]
*  so I took it down talking about the Post. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=112.38s)]
*  The argument he's making here, Jonathan Lemire, is that he was walking down the beach and [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=115.02000000000001s)]
*  saw this shell formation on the beach saying 86, 47, took a photo, posted it, didn't realize [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=118.26s)]
*  it would be interpreted as a call to violence. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=124.9s)]
*  Of course, President Trump survived that assassination attempt last summer. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=128.22s)]
*  There was another assassination plot against him not long after. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=131.62s)]
*  Some people you could make the case are arguing here in bad faith because of the way the president [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=135.98000000000002s)]
*  and others feel about James Comey, but how do you see this playing out? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=140.38s)]
*  We should remind you and I, Gabbard, of course, that Comey would have to be convicted before [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=144.3s)]
*  he went to prison. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=147.62s)]
*  I mean, look, this is a stupid thing that he did, clearly. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=148.62s)]
*  I think there's certainly a lot of faux outrage here. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=152.38000000000002s)]
*  But to be fair, if it had gone the other way and someone had posted 8646 about President [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=155.02s)]
*  Biden, there would be some on the left who would be angry as well. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=160.3s)]
*  We heard from FBI Director Cash Patel that they're going to be investigating it. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=164.38000000000002s)]
*  You already read a number of Trump officials who said they would as well. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=167.54000000000002s)]
*  It's hard to know whether or not there'll be a there there. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=171.98s)]
*  I mean, Comey took the post down immediately. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=174.7s)]
*  He apologized. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=176.7s)]
*  It is still surprising to me that he is so disliked on the right considering the role [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=178.29999999999998s)]
*  he helped play in Donald Trump's original election in 2016. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=181.89999999999998s)]
*  But this is certainly, you know, for those in baga sphere who want to talk about something [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=187.5s)]
*  else, who want to be angry about something, James Comey provided a convenient target for [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=192.5s)]
*  them right now and they're happy to do it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=197.26s)]
*  We should also note that after this, Willie, this bruja with the social media post, Comey [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=198.62s)]
*  took went back on social media later today to promote his new book, which is coming out [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=204.3s)]
*  in the next few weeks. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=209.26s)]
*  All right, we'll see where this goes from here. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkx0iRENU0s&t=210.66s)]
