# Aide to Gabbard under scrutiny after emails show he pushed for edits to intel assessment
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c)
*  And joining us now, Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=0.0s)]
*  He is vice chairman and the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=4.0s)]
*  Senator Warner, thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=8.4s)]
*  Let's just start right there. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  Your reaction to what you saw yesterday between the President of the United States and the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=13.76s)]
*  man who for a time was his most powerful advisor, Elon Musk. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=18.12s)]
*  And what do you think it tells us about this piece of Republican legislation currently [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=22.12s)]
*  in the Senate? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=26.64s)]
*  Well, first of all, it was, again, we all knew this was coming. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=29.560000000000002s)]
*  I had picked Memorial Day as the cutoff, so I'm a few days late. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=33.160000000000004s)]
*  But it's kind of pathetic. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=39.32s)]
*  I mean, it makes us think how we look around the world. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=41.32s)]
*  You got the president and the world's richest guy in this pissing match. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  Think about the close to 60,000 federal workers who got cut because of Elon Musk's chainsaw [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  doge. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=55.72s)]
*  I'm not sure what they get out of this whole exchange. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=56.8s)]
*  What I do think you're seeing is, you know, who's going to make the most money off of [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=60.08s)]
*  the corruption from this administration? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=63.8s)]
*  What feels like the Trump family is going to be number one now and Musk's ability to [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=66.12s)]
*  make money off the administration may be undermined a bit. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=71.32s)]
*  Back to the bill, though, the bill is the ugliest piece of legislation I've ever seen [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=75.52s)]
*  and maybe the most disruptive. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=80.68s)]
*  We all know the litany. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=84.16s)]
*  It adds to the debt. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=85.6s)]
*  It kicks 16 million Americans off of health care. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=86.6s)]
*  It kicks millions who go to the health care exchange and buy their insurance there. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=90.03999999999999s)]
*  It drives up premiums, literally $9,000 over a year period, cuts back food aid. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=95.44s)]
*  And all this, frankly, and I'm not against people being successful, but the bottom line [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=103.64s)]
*  is it ends up raising taxes for people at minimum wage about 53% while giving folks [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=110.36s)]
*  at the very top hundreds of thousands of dollars of tax breaks. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=116.56s)]
*  That is not fair. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  It's not right when so much is at stake. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=121.96000000000001s)]
*  John Howman, give us a beat as to what you think Elon Musk's appetite will be to actually [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=124.92s)]
*  playing in next year's midterms, and then please take a question to the senator. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=129.76s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=135.0s)]
*  Well, I'd say, look, John, we don't know about what Musk's appetite will be ultimately, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=136.0s)]
*  but I will say it's already forgotten that the beginning of the end for Trump and Musk, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=140.32s)]
*  when you could see the writing on the wall that Musk was going to be leaving government [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=146.0s)]
*  in a short, on a shorter leash, on a shorter timetable to be able to thought, was after [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=149.48s)]
*  that Wisconsin primary where Musk spent an extraordinary amount of money, got completely [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=154.28s)]
*  humiliated in the process. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=158.35999999999999s)]
*  When you hear him on X yesterday throwing around these grandiose promises and allusions [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=160.28s)]
*  to maybe creating a new political party and taking on any congressperson who votes for [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=166.04000000000002s)]
*  Trump's domestic policy bill, you have to wonder whether he really has the stomach for [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=171.04000000000002s)]
*  that or whether he is still smarting from having spent, as I said, a gargantuan amount [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=177.04000000000002s)]
*  of money on that Wisconsin Supreme Court race, made himself central to the race, and then [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=182.20000000000002s)]
*  not only lost, but lost in kind of spectacular fashion. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=186.92s)]
*  TVD on that. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=189.48s)]
*  Senator Warner, here's my question for you. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=191.64s)]
*  Again, an Elon Musk question, which is that we've talked, we talk about, you know, what [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=193.32s)]
*  Elon Musk market value, how much money he might be making off this. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=197.76s)]
*  Obviously, these are all important questions. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=200.48s)]
*  But the thing that people in your world often say to me is that like him or not, the United [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=202.83999999999997s)]
*  States government is going to be dealing with Elon Musk for a long time, that the threat [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=208.32s)]
*  of his government contracts is impractical and improbable because Starlink is so important [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=212.8s)]
*  now in a strategic sense, in addition to an economic sense. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=219.8s)]
*  Just talk a little bit about how much the actual infrastructure and some of the defense [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=223.44s)]
*  contracts that Musk has with the United States government are things that he may be the only [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=227.96s)]
*  person, his companies are the only person who can provide that the U.S. really needs. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=233.32000000000002s)]
*  Yes, there are important aspects coming out of the SpaceX program, Starlink, where he [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=239.12s)]
*  does the remote communications. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=245.16s)]
*  But I'd also quickly point out, remember, there were stories popping that Elon Musk [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=247.24s)]
*  sitting in an office in the White House was extorting from countries like Bangladesh, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=253.24s)]
*  Vietnam, South Africa, India, that they would get no relief at all from the crazy Trump [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=259.76s)]
*  tariffs unless those countries were willing to use his Starlink service. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=266.47999999999996s)]
*  And the incredible fact about this was the reports were he were making these calls, had [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=271.59999999999997s)]
*  the president of Bangladesh on the phone out of an office in the White House. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=277.44s)]
*  If that is not graft and extortion at an unprecedented level, and the amazing thing is, folks like [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=281.71999999999997s)]
*  the Post and Redios reported on it, but there was barely a blip because this kind of behavior [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=288.79999999999995s)]
*  expectation coming out of the Trump family and coming out of Elon Musk, we've almost [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=294.74s)]
*  grown immune to it. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=300.02000000000004s)]
*  So is Trump's assets useful for the intelligence community? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=300.86s)]
*  Yes. But should we be taken aback and frankly try to clean up the level of graft and [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=306.18s)]
*  extortion that has come out of this operation and frankly out of the Trump family? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=313.06s)]
*  I sure as hell hope we can, because what's also at risk here, America's reputation has [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=316.98s)]
*  not only been based on our innovation, our defense prowess, but the fact that we're [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=322.14s)]
*  supposed to be a country of rule of law. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=327.09999999999997s)]
*  And that has been so undermined in this roughly first 120 days of this administration. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=329.09999999999997s)]
*  I'm not sure even with the disappearance of Musk or hopefully the ultimate imploding [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=334.09999999999997s)]
*  of Trump that we're going to get that back right away. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=341.5s)]
*  And that makes us weaker around the world. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=343.7s)]
*  So, Senator, on a related note, sort of lost in the Musk headlines yesterday, President [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=346.9s)]
*  Trump talked about the Ukraine-Russia conflict and suggested once more the U.S. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=350.82s)]
*  might take a step back and these two countries might need to fight it out like children on [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=354.5s)]
*  the playground for a bit. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=358.21999999999997s)]
*  He has also he's also in the past withheld intel sharing from Ukraine. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=360.9s)]
*  No sign he's going to do that yet. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=366.38s)]
*  That threat remains. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=368.02s)]
*  And Senator, you've been speaking out about what you call the Trump administration's [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=369.06s)]
*  attempt to politicize intel. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=372.38s)]
*  It involves a top aide to National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard rewriting analysis [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=374.65999999999997s)]
*  to align with a claim by the president. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=379.9s)]
*  A shocking accusation. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=382.82s)]
*  Senator, please tell us more. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=384.34s)]
*  Well, Jonathan, the one thing about intelligence, it's got to speak truth to power. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=387.73999999999995s)]
*  You can't cook the books. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=393.29999999999995s)]
*  And the irony is, and one of the reasons I voted against Tulsi Gabbard to be director [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=394.94s)]
*  of National Intelligence when she said she would not politicize intelligence, I didn't [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=398.09999999999997s)]
*  believe that at all. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=402.73999999999995s)]
*  So what we've got is the case of her chief of staff, Joe Kent, who she's now trying to [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=403.85999999999996s)]
*  promote to a different position, who went in and took what's called the National [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=409.58s)]
*  Intelligence estimate of this gang in Venezuela, Tren del Agua, bad guys, bad folks. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=414.65999999999997s)]
*  But the independent intelligence assessment basically said they're bad guys, but the [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=421.46s)]
*  Maduro government in Venezuela doesn't necessarily correct them. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=425.38s)]
*  This guy, Kent, went and said, you've got to change that because that might upset the [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=429.14s)]
*  president. We've got it in, frankly, email traffic. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=434.94s)]
*  Then the folks who would put this intelligence assessment together were fired because they [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=439.46s)]
*  wouldn't bend the knee and corrupt their intelligence product. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=444.82s)]
*  This guy is still up for a position in national counterterrorism. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=448.5s)]
*  He ought to be withdrawn or John Thune ought to not bring him up for a vote, because, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=453.14s)]
*  again, undermining intelligence. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=458.74s)]
*  I've had three or four of our top allies say to me, hey, Mark, you know, what is going [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=461.42s)]
*  on? Can we trust you guys to share information if in the case of, say, the Signalgate [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=466.62s)]
*  information, some shared from the Israelis that was carelessly used and could have exposed [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=473.82s)]
*  our pilots or now you've got the independence of intelligence going to the president [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=479.02s)]
*  manipulated because you don't want to do anything that might embarrass the president. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=484.58s)]
*  That is totally against all of the norms that have been set up. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=488.14s)]
*  And if our partners stop sharing intelligence with us again, America will be weaker. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=492.62s)]
*  Yeah, an important storyline to follow in the weeks ahead. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=498.5s)]
*  Vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Democratic Senator Mark Warner of [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=501.5s)]
*  Virginia, Virginia. Senator, thank you so much. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCZBQnSi9c&t=504.66s)]
