# Joe: The president has two choices in the Middle East and either will upset his base
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw)
*  President Trump is back in the White House this morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=0.0s)]
*  He left the G7 meeting last night a day early to deal with the escalating conflict in the [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=2.96s)]
*  Middle East. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=9.36s)]
*  An administration official also tells NBC News Trump has requested the National Security [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=10.36s)]
*  Council be prepared in the Situation Room. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=15.36s)]
*  The White House announced his early departure from Canada just an hour after the president [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=18.96s)]
*  urged residents in Tehran to immediately evacuate, writing on Truth Social, quote, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=24.12s)]
*  Iran should have signed the deal I told them to sign. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  He was asked about that on Air Force One overnight. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=36.760000000000005s)]
*  What was the thinking on the call for Tehran to evacuate? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=39.56s)]
*  Is there a threat or is there incoming? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=44.56s)]
*  What was the thinking on the call? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=47.56s)]
*  I want people to be safe. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=48.56s)]
*  And that's always the last thing I think that could happen. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=49.56s)]
*  I just want people to be safe. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=51.56s)]
*  Is there any new concern about U.S. troops or assets in the region? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=52.56s)]
*  Great people that are in ridiculous situations. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=53.56s)]
*  And when you say better, what's the next thing that will come down so hard if they do anything [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=54.56s)]
*  to our people? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=55.56s)]
*  You know, Karen, some ominous signs. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=56.56s)]
*  We don't know exactly what's going to happen, but the president last night warning residents [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=59.08s)]
*  of Tehran to evacuate immediately. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=67.4s)]
*  That's not an easy thing to do. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=69.80000000000001s)]
*  We're not going to let that happen. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=71.80000000000001s)]
*  We're going to let that happen. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=72.80000000000001s)]
*  We're not going to let that happen. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=73.80000000000001s)]
*  We're going to let that happen. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=74.80000000000001s)]
*  We're going to let that happen. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=75.80000000000001s)]
*  We're going to let that happen. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=76.80000000000001s)]
*  We're going to let that happen. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=77.80000000000001s)]
*  We're going to let that happen. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=78.80000000000001s)]
*  That's not an easy thing to do. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  It's chaos there. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=81.48s)]
*  They're not even they're not even getting much guidance from their own government. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=83.36s)]
*  They don't have the elaborate bunker system that the Israelis have. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  But you add on top of that, the president also announcing a meeting this morning of [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=93.84s)]
*  his top national security officials. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=98.2s)]
*  Sounds like ominous signs for Iran, suggesting that perhaps perhaps the United States may [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=101.56s)]
*  become involved in this conflict. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=109.16000000000001s)]
*  What can you tell us? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  Well, you know, one thing we know about the president is he always thinks that there is [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=111.96000000000001s)]
*  a deal in here somewhere. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=116.80000000000001s)]
*  But I think it's becoming pretty clear that that he is about to face his biggest test [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=119.56s)]
*  as commander in chief and as the leader of a world power. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=126.4s)]
*  And that is whether or not to get involved in this conflict, whether, for instance, to [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=130.88s)]
*  give Israel the bunker busting bombs that they would need, U.S. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=137.28s)]
*  bombs to really go after the Iran nuclear facilities, which are underground. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=142.88s)]
*  And if he does that, that is going to not only be the end of potentially be the beginning [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=149.52s)]
*  of a remaking of the Middle East, but it would also, I think, really deeply divide his [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=159.28s)]
*  own mega coalition. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=165.32s)]
*  Yeah, and that's what I wanted to ask you about, Jonathan Martin. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=168.88s)]
*  It seems to me the president has two choices as we move forward. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=171.2s)]
*  One is to get involved and and and possibly help Israel bring about regime change in Iran. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=176.12s)]
*  That, of course, there are opportunities there. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=186.2s)]
*  But history has shown us in the Middle East a lot more opportunity for destabilization. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=188.56s)]
*  But also a great divide inside the mega coalition with people like Tucker Carlson and others [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=194.92s)]
*  saying that it might spell the end of the Trump presidency. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=204.27999999999997s)]
*  That's on one side. On the other side, you have traditional conservatives who have seen [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=207.72s)]
*  Iran as epicenter of terror since 1979. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=213.16s)]
*  And will Donald Trump take the blame for not finishing off the Ayatollah when he had a chance to do it in 2025? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=218.12s)]
*  So so either way he goes, he's going to upset people in his own base. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=229.24s)]
*  Take us inside that debate in the Republican coalition. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=235.4s)]
*  Trump said it pretty clearly over the weekend. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=241.4s)]
*  He said, I decide what America first means, which kind of reminds us of that great saying, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=243.4s)]
*  I am the decider that we heard from a previous president. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=250.44s)]
*  The truth is, Joe, Trump doesn't have strong feelings about on Iran policy. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=254.12s)]
*  Trump wants to be on the side of what's popular and what's going to make him look good. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=258.68s)]
*  And I think he was he was uncertain about the Israelis going in. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=263.48s)]
*  I think Bibi knew that. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=270.44s)]
*  I think Bibi was deeply concerned that Trump was going to was going to try to find some deal with the Iranians. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=272.28s)]
*  And so Bibi went ahead with the attacks to preempt Trump doing precisely that deal. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=278.03999999999996s)]
*  And that's why you saw the attacks launched last week. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=284.28s)]
*  Trump, of course, says that the attacks were well done, good on the Israelis because they were successful. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=288.44s)]
*  But, Joe, you know, if it hadn't gone well, that first wave of attacks, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=295.0s)]
*  Trump would have run like a scalded dog from Israel and from Netanyahu. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=299.8s)]
*  But it's only because they go well that Trump's now on the side of go after the Iranians. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=304.28000000000003s)]
*  But going forward, it's going to be a harder choice for Trump because, yes, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=309.16s)]
*  there are going to be questions about what role the U.S. plays. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=313.32s)]
*  Is it troops? Is it air support? Is it just our weapons that the Israelis are using? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=316.76s)]
*  It's going to be hard for Trump to avoid those questions going forward. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=321.48s)]
*  And by the way, I think part of the reason why he left early, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=325.0s)]
*  the G7, was not to go spend eight hours today in the sit room. That's not Donald Trump. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=327.88s)]
*  He doesn't want to be forced to answer those questions from his contemporaries in the G7, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=332.44s)]
*  hour after hour out there in the Canadian Rockies. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=339.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I've got to say the challenges, the greatest challenges, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=342.92s)]
*  lie ahead for the president in making decisions because it's one thing to sit back during the [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=348.04s)]
*  first and second strikes. It's quite another as chaos begins to break out in Tehran and perhaps [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=353.56s)]
*  in the entire region. Karen, politics, my gosh, we see it time and time again, how the changing [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=361.24s)]
*  of presidencies where you have one president that loathes the prior president, or at least what the [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=374.6s)]
*  prior president did. We can go back and look at Barack Obama, who wanted to find his presidency [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=380.76s)]
*  by not being Bush and Cheney. And yet he continued so many of their policies on the war on terror, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=389.32s)]
*  especially. He upped drone attacks and found out he had to do a lot of things that he didn't want [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=396.59999999999997s)]
*  to do. You could go back to Bill Clinton criticizing George H.W. Bush on China, but then adopting [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=403.08s)]
*  basically George H.W. Bush's position on China here, you have Donald Trump being frustrated by [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=409.56s)]
*  the same two leaders that haunted Joe Biden for his last two years in office, Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=416.36s)]
*  and Vladimir Putin. And here Donald Trump finds himself in the same position with two [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=425.08s)]
*  obstinate leaders who don't care what the American president has to say, whether he is a Democrat [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=431.16s)]
*  or a Republican. And also not really appreciating the irony that for all he has criticized [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=437.64s)]
*  Barack Obama for the Iran nuclear deal, here he is himself desperately seeking a negotiated solution [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=444.76s)]
*  with the Iranians. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ4HOAYICw&t=454.52s)]
