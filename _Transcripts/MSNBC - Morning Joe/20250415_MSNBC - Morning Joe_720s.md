# Trump floats alarming deportation idea while meeting with El Salvador's president
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ)
*  The Trump administration and El Salvador's government are striking a defiant tone in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=0.0s)]
*  the case of Kilmar Abrego-Garcia, the Maryland man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador's [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=6.0s)]
*  notorious mega prison last month. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  El Salvador's president met with President Trump at the White House yesterday amid the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=16.56s)]
*  administration's sweeping immigration crackdown, despite repeated calls for Abrego-Garcia's [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=21.72s)]
*  return to the U.S. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=28.52s)]
*  Both leaders made it clear he won't be coming back. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=30.759999999999998s)]
*  How can I return him to the United States? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=34.72s)]
*  It's like I smuggle him into the United States or what do I do? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=37.72s)]
*  Of course I'm not going to do it. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=40.72s)]
*  It's like, the question is preposterous. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=43.72s)]
*  How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=45.72s)]
*  I don't have the power to return him to the United States. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=48.72s)]
*  As many as possible and I just asked the president, you know, it's this massive complex that he [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=51.72s)]
*  built, jail complex, I said can you build some more of them please? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=57.82s)]
*  As many as we can get out of our country that were allowed in here by incompetent Joe Biden [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=62.52s)]
*  through open borders. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=68.42s)]
*  Willie of course and Mika Abrego-Garcia has never been charged with any gang related crimes [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=70.82s)]
*  and in 2019 an immigration judge actually barred him from being deported to El Salvador [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=77.3s)]
*  saying he'd be harmed there. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=83.53999999999999s)]
*  The Justice Department has acknowledged Willie time and again he was deported because of [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=85.82s)]
*  an administrative error. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=92.02s)]
*  Now last week the Supreme Court directed the Trump administration to facilitate his return [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=94.02s)]
*  to the United States. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=100.39999999999999s)]
*  But here's the thing though Willie, there was ambiguity there and it's ambiguity that [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=102.22s)]
*  a lot of people were talking about beforehand where they said help facilitate the return [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=109.82s)]
*  and then in another sentence they directed the district court judge though to make sure [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=115.38s)]
*  you respect the president's ability to be commander in chief and run U.S. foreign policy. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=119.61999999999999s)]
*  Obviously basically giving an escape route for whether it's the president or Stephen [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=126.5s)]
*  Miller to say hey the Supreme Court agreed with us and this is something that Danny Savalas [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=133.42s)]
*  said last week which is you may think this is a win for Garcia, the Supreme Court's going [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=138.22s)]
*  to look at this and say it's a win for them and that's exactly what they did yesterday. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=144.9s)]
*  Yeah and President Trump and others in the room yesterday sort of misrepresented what [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=148.34s)]
*  the Supreme Court did actually say in its ruling and said it was purely on our side [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=153.26s)]
*  so leaving that ambiguity gave them the opening to say we won that case. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=157.82s)]
*  President Trump then in that meeting yesterday kind of went around the room asking members [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=162.5s)]
*  of his cabinet to weigh in on the deportation of Abrego Garcia. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=166.22s)]
*  Listen to what Attorney General Pam Bondi, White House advisor Stephen Miller and Secretary [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=170.89999999999998s)]
*  of State Marco Rubio had to say. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=176.7s)]
*  First and foremost he was illegally in our country, he had been illegally in our country [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=179.29999999999998s)]
*  and in 2019 two courts, an immigration court and an appellate immigration court ruled that [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=186.06s)]
*  he was a member of MS-13 and he was illegally in our country. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=192.78s)]
*  Right now it was a paperwork, it was additional paperwork that needed to be done. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=199.57999999999998s)]
*  That's up to El Salvador if they want to return him, that's not up to us. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=204.11999999999998s)]
*  The Supreme Court ruled President that if El Salvador wants to return him, this is international [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=208.6s)]
*  matters, foreign affairs, if they wanted to return him we would facilitate it, meaning [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=214.67999999999998s)]
*  provide a plane. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=220.61999999999998s)]
*  So as Pam mentioned there's an illegal alien from El Salvador, so with respect to you he's [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=223.6s)]
*  a citizen of El Salvador, so it's very arrogant even for American media to suggest that we [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=230.72s)]
*  would even tell El Salvador how to handle their own citizens as a starting point. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=236.76s)]
*  As two immigration courts found that he was a member of MS-13. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=241.24s)]
*  I don't understand what the confusion is, this individual is a citizen of El Salvador, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=245.76s)]
*  he was illegally in the United States and was returned to his country, that's where [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=250.38s)]
*  you deport people back to their country of origin, except for Venezuela that wasn't refusing [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=253.98s)]
*  to take people back or places like that. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=258.02s)]
*  I can tell you this Mr. President, no, the foreign policy of the United States is conducted [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=260.14s)]
*  by the President of the United States, not by a court, and no court in the United States [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=264.62s)]
*  has a right to conduct the foreign policy of the United States, it's that simple, end [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=269.14s)]
*  of story. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=272.98s)]
*  Let's bring in NBC News Senior Homeland Security correspondent Julia Ainsley and NBC News National [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=273.98s)]
*  Security editor David Rode, good morning to you both. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=278.7s)]
*  So David what did you hear in those comments as it sort of went around the room, Donald [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=281.97999999999996s)]
*  Trump opened the floor to his cabinet? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=286.4s)]
*  It's this I would say odd sort of performative loyalty test in terms of repeating the same [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=289.7s)]
*  talking points, many of which don't correctly describe what the Supreme Court ruled or the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=297.26s)]
*  facts of what happened in a Briego Garcia's case. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=302.03999999999996s)]
*  He was never convicted in a full court of being a member of this gang and these judges, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=305.62s)]
*  the Supreme Court itself isn't trying to take over American foreign policy, they're simply [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=312.46s)]
*  saying to the Trump administration, you deported this person to El Salvador and now bring him [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=316.1s)]
*  back. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=322.74s)]
*  They're not trying to dictate a broader thing, but it's just a strange dynamic and you see [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=323.74s)]
*  this over and over in cabinet meetings where these cabinet members have to sort of say [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=329.42s)]
*  these things fervently and maybe they believe them to be fair, but it's just it's unusual. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=333.36s)]
*  Julia Ainsley, what's your reporting on this? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=338.88s)]
*  Obviously there was another deportation flight even after the 9-0 ruling and also what questions [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=341.72s)]
*  are you looking at as it pertains to this quote mistaken return of Briego Garcia? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=349.72s)]
*  I mean, Mika, so I'm looking forward. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=359.12s)]
*  I think the most jarring thing that came out of that yesterday was when President Trump [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=361.15999999999997s)]
*  said that he was asked President Bukele to build five more of those prisons because he [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=364.88s)]
*  wanted to continue to use it not just for people who are in the country illegally or [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=369.8s)]
*  may have crossed into the country illegally, but for anyone who he deems a very violent [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=374.2s)]
*  criminal that could be U.S. citizens, Mika. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=379.0s)]
*  He was asked specifically about naturalized U.S. citizens. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=381.59999999999997s)]
*  I think a question for Trump is would he consider sending people who speak out against his policies? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=384.76s)]
*  Would he consider sending foreign students there? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=390.52s)]
*  I think there are a lot of lines that we haven't asked him if he's willing to cross when it [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=393.15999999999997s)]
*  comes to this policy because now they're really using this as a scare tactic in order to drive [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=398.59999999999997s)]
*  down numbers at the border and as we'll get to later if they can't deport enough people, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=404.91999999999996s)]
*  this could be an ultimate tool. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=409.76s)]
*  That's exactly what Kristi Noem said when she went and stood outside of those prisons [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=411.23999999999995s)]
*  and Sikat and El Salvador is this could be your future if you come into the United States. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=416.2s)]
*  And then further on what happened more recently just this weekend, they sent 10 more people [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=421.84s)]
*  to El Salvador and it's not clear. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=426.92s)]
*  We just got the news from a tweet, a post on X from Marco Rubio, is that they sent 10 [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=429.46s)]
*  more people to El Salvador and instead we don't know whether or not they complied with [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=434.64s)]
*  the Supreme Court order when they were weighing in on a separate part of this policy where [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=439.76s)]
*  they said that anyone going to El Salvador even under the Alien Enemies Act gets the [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=443.96s)]
*  right under due process to argue why they should not be part of the class that gets [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=447.85999999999996s)]
*  sent there in the first place. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=452.84s)]
*  So it's unclear under what provision they sent these people. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=454.4s)]
*  Now it could be they just simply did it under the Immigration Nationalities Act, not Alien [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=457.79999999999995s)]
*  Enemies Act, which would in turn mean that they could have already had final orders of [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=461.32s)]
*  deportation and now doing it that way has not been challenged in court if you actually [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=465.4s)]
*  just deport people to El Salvador. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=470.8s)]
*  But even still, these are people who may not be from El Salvador. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=472.72s)]
*  Most of them are Venezuelan being held in these conditions. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=476.64s)]
*  So looking forward, I think this is just the beginning of this relationship between Trump [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=479.6s)]
*  and Bukele and the beginning of how much we're going to see. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=484.8s)]
*  They wouldn't even put a limit on how many people they're going to be holding in those [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=488.52s)]
*  facilities. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=492.48s)]
*  And Julia, to your first point, President Trump is again floating the idea of deporting [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=493.48s)]
*  U.S. citizens to El Salvador. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=498.92s)]
*  As Trump and El Salvador's president walked into the Oval Office yesterday, a live stream [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=501.8s)]
*  of the event caught the duo discussing the idea. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=506.0s)]
*  As the meeting began, Trump confirmed his administration is looking into it. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=510.0s)]
*  David Rode, let's talk about the legality here of that and also how it compares to Trump's [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=558.76s)]
*  first term when it comes to those cabinet members and head of DOJ, what they would have [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=565.56s)]
*  said. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=571.56s)]
*  So the president is talking about sending American citizens to essentially a foreign [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=572.56s)]
*  penal colony where the president, President Bukele, has said the current people there, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=577.68s)]
*  he doesn't know when he will release them. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=583.0s)]
*  So this is a startling change, a huge step forward just in this administration that he's [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=585.38s)]
*  even talking about this idea. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=590.26s)]
*  And then it's remarkably different from the first term. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=592.24s)]
*  In that first term, you saw that the administration went out of its way to make sure the Supreme [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=595.24s)]
*  Court, with the travel ban, which was a huge issue, there were five, I think four to five [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=599.18s)]
*  versions of it to get it up to snuff so that the Supreme Court would say this was legal. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=604.8s)]
*  Here it's ignore the Supreme Court. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=610.86s)]
*  It's dismissed the Supreme Court and to bring up these more and more, again, I guess, frankly, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=612.54s)]
*  radically, legally radical ideas. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=617.86s)]
*  It is illegal and unconstitutional to send an American to a foreign prison, like period, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=620.64s)]
*  full stop. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=627.3s)]
*  And you know, I was surprised and alarmed by what was said. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=628.9399999999999s)]
*  Well, and again, it is, Pam Bondi can do all the research she wants to do, the Justice [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=633.02s)]
*  Department can, but it is illegal and it is unconstitutional to send Americans to these [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=638.06s)]
*  prisons. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=646.02s)]
*  And my only point I will make, though, on the Supreme Court decision on Garcia is it's [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=647.4599999999999s)]
*  probably going to go back up to the Supreme Court. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=657.14s)]
*  And this time, they're going to have to be far more explicit in their language. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=661.9399999999999s)]
*  And not leave as many ambiguities there open. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=668.9s)]
*  It's almost like they did that intentionally because it would allow them to lay down the [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=671.94s)]
*  law saying the president should facilitate the return, but at the same time, say the [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=681.46s)]
*  district court has to give deference to the president. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=688.0600000000001s)]
*  There is a way to write that up far more specifically. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=691.38s)]
*  And chances are good. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=695.5s)]
*  They've only delayed the inevitable and the inevitable showdown. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP19WgT6vlQ&t=696.5s)]
