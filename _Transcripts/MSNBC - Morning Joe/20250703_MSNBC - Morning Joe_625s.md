# 'Cowardly' Republicans have put fealty to Trump, billionaires over constituents: DNC Chair
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [July 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA)
*  chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Ken Martin. Mr. Chairman, good [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=0.0s)]
*  morning. Your reaction to the news that it looks inevitable at this point that [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=4.76s)]
*  this bill will pass. Well, it's shameful. And look, here's the deal. These cowardly [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  Republicans who refuse to meet with their constituents who clearly don't [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=13.68s)]
*  have a spine has put their fealty to Donald Trump and his billionaire friends [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  ahead of the constituents that they were elected to serve. As we know, this is the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=21.88s)]
*  most unpopular bill in over a half a century. There's no provision in this [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=26.4s)]
*  bill that people in this country support. And guess what? This is a betrayal of the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=30.68s)]
*  people that these Republicans were supposed to serve. Think about this. This [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=35.28s)]
*  is a betrayal to seniors in this country where over a quarter of nursing homes [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=39.16s)]
*  are going to close and we're going to have to throw seniors out into the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=44.4s)]
*  streets. This is a betrayal to children where we're cutting SNAP benefits and [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=47.12s)]
*  three million children, at least three million children, are going to go without [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=51.36s)]
*  food because of this disastrous bill. This is a betrayal to the disabled. When [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=55.28s)]
*  we throw 17 million people off of their health care, this is a betrayal to rural [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=59.96s)]
*  communities. We're going to close 300 hospitals and clinics throughout this [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=64.84s)]
*  country and people are going to have struggle to find health care throughout [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=68.44s)]
*  this country. And it is a betrayal to workers in this country. Just in the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=72.75999999999999s)]
*  building trades alone, 1.75 million jobs are going to be lost because of this [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=76.88s)]
*  bill. This is one of the biggest betrayals we've seen in recent history. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  And we're going to remind voters next year, trust me, this is not going to go [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=86.44s)]
*  well for Republicans. And someone said this earlier, they are handing us a gift [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=90.56s)]
*  on a silver platter. But the problem with all of this is while it might be good [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=94.8s)]
*  politically, it's going to be disastrous for the American people who are going [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=98.64s)]
*  their lives are going to be shattered and communities are going to be [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=102.88s)]
*  afflicted with a lot of pain over the coming years because of this bill. Yeah, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  the politics should take a backseat to what's actually going to happen to real [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=110.76s)]
*  people because of this bill. But it is your job as the chair of the DNC to win [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=114.36s)]
*  elections, to help win elections for the Democratic Party. So as you move forward, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=118.72s)]
*  we should point out the midterm elections everyone's talking about are 16 [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=123.24s)]
*  months away. We're not talking about this fall. There's a lot of time between [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=126.36s)]
*  now and then. And we know how things change and happen so quickly, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=129.64s)]
*  particularly in this political environment we live in today. So how do [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=133.48s)]
*  you as someone charged with keeping the message alive? How do you continue to [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=137.6s)]
*  push that all the way and try to win the House and the Senate? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, as you know, we've already held 130 town halls throughout the country in [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=145.56s)]
*  Republican districts because the Republicans refuse to do their job and [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=150.28s)]
*  meet with their constituents. And we're going to continue up that pressure, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=153.8s)]
*  not just to obviously stop a bill, but to make sure that Republicans are held [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=156.84s)]
*  accountable throughout this country for their vote on this bill. You know, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=160.8s)]
*  yeah, there's a long, long time between now and the elections of 26. We have [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=164.72s)]
*  elections in 25 critical elections in New Jersey, Virginia, Pennsylvania, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  over 100,000 elections on the ballot, local elections on the ballot that we're [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=172.76000000000002s)]
*  going to compete in this this fall and this summer. And there's no doubt that [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=176.68s)]
*  that in many cases, those elections will be a referendum on what happened here [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=180.88s)]
*  in Washington, D. C. And we're going to continue that pressure. We're doing that [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=185.20000000000002s)]
*  right now with our organizing summer campaign. And I would encourage your [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=188.44s)]
*  listeners, if you want to join our organizing efforts to hold Republicans [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=191.76s)]
*  accountable throughout the country, text action to three four three three six [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=195.76s)]
*  seven action to four three three six seven to join our organizing summer [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=201.44s)]
*  campaign. We're going to turn up the heat, make sure Republicans are held [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=205.6s)]
*  accountable for their disastrous vote on this bill and make sure that we're put [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=209.76s)]
*  in ourselves in a position to win back the majority in the U. S. House of [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=213.96s)]
*  Representatives in the state in the U. S. Senate and elections up and down the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=217.52s)]
*  ballot next year. Look, this is a critical, critical time for our party. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=221.64s)]
*  More importantly, it's a critical time for this country. And the Democratic [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=225.76s)]
*  Party is the only thing standing in the way of this full on authoritarian regime [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=229.04s)]
*  having an unimpeded path to do whatever the hell they want to inflict more pain [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=234.23999999999998s)]
*  and damage in this country. Hey, Ken, it's Ali Vitali. I hear the point that [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=238.61999999999998s)]
*  you're making, and I actually agree that the issues within this bill really [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=243.67999999999998s)]
*  dovetail nicely with where Democrats seem to be finding success on messaging, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=246.92s)]
*  concepts like affordability and health care have been good for y'all in the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=251.48s)]
*  past, not not just recently in the New York City mayoral race. But I also can't [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=255.48s)]
*  help but think about the way that, you know, political gifts were talked about [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=259.76s)]
*  back in 2016 when I had Hillary Clinton staffers saying to me, Trump is a [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=263.28s)]
*  political gift and we saw the way that that turned out. So how can advocates [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=266.96s)]
*  who have been worried about the Democratic messaging and the way that [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=271.03999999999996s)]
*  y'all relate to voters, how can you assuage them at this point when gifts [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=274.18s)]
*  have been squandered in the past? Well, you know, I think it's a fair point, Ali, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=278.08s)]
*  but let me just tell you, this is the most unpopular piece of legislation that [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=282.47999999999996s)]
*  we've seen in over a half of a century, right? You know, look, we're not [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=286.47999999999996s)]
*  underestimating Donald Trump. I think people underestimated Donald Trump before. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=290.64s)]
*  We didn't, a lot of folks in our party didn't believe how bad he was going to be [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=294.4s)]
*  as president. And sure enough, you know, I think the difference now is, you know, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=298.52s)]
*  all of those independent voters and Republican voters who voted for Donald [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=303.03999999999996s)]
*  Trump are having deep ire's remorse because he said to them on day one that [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=307.1s)]
*  he was going to improve their lives. He was going to strengthen their [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=311.1s)]
*  communities. He was going to make their lives more affordable and help them [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=313.44s)]
*  actually climb the economic ladder and achieve success for their family. He [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=317.06s)]
*  hasn't focused one bit on that. And this is an opportunity for the Democratic [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=320.78000000000003s)]
*  Party to expand our coalition, to bring people back into our party, back into [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=324.94s)]
*  the conversation by fighting for them. And I'll tell you right now, we're not [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=329.0s)]
*  going to squander that opportunity. I think you see the unity amongst [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=332.42s)]
*  Democrats throughout the country and fighting back against this bill and [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=337.22s)]
*  certainly making sure that we're positioning ourselves to win. You know, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=340.86s)]
*  look, don't make no mistake about it. The Democratic Party, we're here to [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=344.02000000000004s)]
*  fight, we're here to win, and we're here to make sure that we actually give [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=349.02000000000004s)]
*  American people a sense that their better days are ahead of them and that [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=352.26s)]
*  this bullshit bill that they see right now in Congress, that's not going to [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=355.5s)]
*  happen if you put Democrats back in power. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=359.54s)]
*  Getting in some colorful language before 9 a.m. there, but I sense the [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=362.3s)]
*  frustration and it's echoed, frankly, from those on Capitol Hill, including [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=365.82s)]
*  Jeffries, who's still speaking. But I wonder then if you can take us inside [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=369.3s)]
*  the map, because at the end of the day, none of it really matters unless you [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=372.42s)]
*  can retake the House and much more difficultly the Senate. But look at look [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=375.3s)]
*  at for viewers some of the districts that we should be looking at going [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=380.18s)]
*  forward. As you see Republicans taking a tough vote here, Fitzpatrick, of [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=383.58000000000004s)]
*  course, could be a no vote explained by the fact that he's in a swing district. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=387.26s)]
*  But where else should people be looking and where else are you targeting on [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=391.1s)]
*  the ground? Well, there's a number of districts. Look, we've we've been able [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=394.3s)]
*  to actually, Ali, expand out the map over the last few months, where we [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=397.94s)]
*  started with the much more narrow list of targets for the House. We've seen [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=402.02000000000004s)]
*  an overperformance in 35 special elections on the ballot since Donald [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=406.38s)]
*  Trump was inaugurated. We have overperformed in all of them and one in [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=410.98s)]
*  many of those elections. What does that suggest? It suggests as we head into [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=415.06s)]
*  the 26 elections where we only need three seats to win back the U. S. House [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=419.9s)]
*  that we have been able to expand our map and expand the number of [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=424.65999999999997s)]
*  opportunities we have to win back the majority. And you know, the list is so [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=427.7s)]
*  long. I'm not going to go over every one of them. But if you want a list of [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=431.82s)]
*  them again, text action to 43367 and we will make sure that you know and your [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=434.94s)]
*  viewers know exactly where we're putting our efforts around the [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=440.94s)]
*  congressional map on the Senate map. Of course, people say, Well, it's [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=443.82s)]
*  impossible for us to win the Senate back. Those same people are the ones [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=446.94s)]
*  who said in 2006 that there's no way we were going to win both chambers. And [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=450.65999999999997s)]
*  of course, that wave election helped usher us back into power in both [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=454.29999999999995s)]
*  chambers. And think about this. George Bush's numbers in 2005 were higher [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=458.73999999999995s)]
*  than Trump's numbers are in 2000 and 25. Trump's numbers in 2017, a [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=463.88s)]
*  precursor to another wave election, were higher than they are right now. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=471.82s)]
*  Again, I think if this trend line continues for the Republican Party, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=475.82s)]
*  there is a real shot for us to win not just the House back, but the Senate as [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J8urFQh4SA&t=480.06s)]
