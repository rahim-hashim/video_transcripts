# Stock market holds up ‘remarkably well’ despite rising Middle East tensions
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F85n2fVV56Q)
*  And the co-anchor of CNBC's Swapbox and a New York Times columnist, Andrew Rastorkin. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F85n2fVV56Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Andrew, let's take a look at how Wall Street is reacting to the events in the Middle East. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F85n2fVV56Q&t=5.72s)]
*  You know, there's something very almost counterintuitive, if not surprising, about what's happened, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F85n2fVV56Q&t=12.0s)]
*  which is that the stock market has held up remarkably well, if not better than I think [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F85n2fVV56Q&t=17.68s)]
*  a lot of people had anticipated. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F85n2fVV56Q&t=21.04s)]
*  And in particular, unusually, if you go and look at what's happened actually among Israeli [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F85n2fVV56Q&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  stocks, so these are companies based in Israel, and you look at the stock exchange there, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F85n2fVV56Q&t=28.52s)]
*  of course Tel Aviv's stock exchange was damaged by a missile yesterday. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F85n2fVV56Q&t=33.12s)]
*  The stock market is almost at an all-time high. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F85n2fVV56Q&t=39.2s)]
*  It's actually rocketed over the past week, to use maybe the wrong terminology there, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F85n2fVV56Q&t=41.8s)]
*  in part because there's a view that actually maybe Iran is either going to be toppled or [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F85n2fVV56Q&t=47.68s)]
*  the risks associated with it are going to be won by Israel. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F85n2fVV56Q&t=55.24s)]
*  And so it's a very sort of unique thing to watch. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F85n2fVV56Q&t=58.84s)]
*  One thing that's been fascinating, even just over the past couple of years, you know, for [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F85n2fVV56Q&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  a long time, whenever there was news about a potential war or some kind of great conflict [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F85n2fVV56Q&t=64.64s)]
*  or turmoil, the stock market would nosedive. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F85n2fVV56Q&t=69.56s)]
*  And in the last couple of years, the opposite has actually happened. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F85n2fVV56Q&t=72.52000000000001s)]
*  If you go even look over the last decade, there's oftentimes a little bit of a clip [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F85n2fVV56Q&t=75.56s)]
*  down, but it would have been a mistake to actually sell on those days. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F85n2fVV56Q&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  In fact, it probably would have been the right thing to actually buy on those days. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F85n2fVV56Q&t=85.67999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so Andrew, the one exception here, I think many Americans would say, would be oil, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F85n2fVV56Q&t=91.16s)]
*  obviously. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F85n2fVV56Q&t=97.68s)]
*  Price of oil has jumped 10, 15 percent. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F85n2fVV56Q&t=98.8s)]
*  If the United States gets involved, if the war continues and intensifies, what do you [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F85n2fVV56Q&t=102.24s)]
*  suspect will happen not only to oil prices, but also how much more will Americans be paying [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F85n2fVV56Q&t=110.03999999999999s)]
*  at the pump? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F85n2fVV56Q&t=115.56s)]
*  Well, look, I think people will be going to be paying more at the pump. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F85n2fVV56Q&t=116.56s)]
*  That is true. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F85n2fVV56Q&t=119.4s)]
*  I think it really depends on what you think the outcome of the situation in Iran ultimately [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F85n2fVV56Q&t=121.28s)]
*  is. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F85n2fVV56Q&t=125.64s)]
*  And if it's something that is resolved one way or the other quickly or something that [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F85n2fVV56Q&t=126.64s)]
*  you think plays out over a very, very long period of time, if this becomes like the Iraq [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F85n2fVV56Q&t=130.92s)]
*  War or something like that, all of a sudden, yes, this could be very, very damaging to [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F85n2fVV56Q&t=136.12s)]
*  the U.S. economy, to the global economy. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F85n2fVV56Q&t=141.12s)]
*  No question. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F85n2fVV56Q&t=144.32s)]
*  If you think that there are several quick and successful strikes, the truth is actually, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F85n2fVV56Q&t=145.92s)]
*  you'd imagine actually the stock market would go higher and while oil would continue to [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F85n2fVV56Q&t=152.84s)]
*  probably rise given all of those issues, it's unclear given how resilient this economy has [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F85n2fVV56Q&t=157.51999999999998s)]
*  been whether it would actually be that damaging. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F85n2fVV56Q&t=162.56s)]
