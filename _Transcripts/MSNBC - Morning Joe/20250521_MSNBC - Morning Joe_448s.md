# Katty Kay: Was Secretary Noem performing for an audience of one at hearing?
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w)
*  All right, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem failed to define habeas corpus, the constitutional [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=0.0s)]
*  right against unlawful detention. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=7.140000000000001s)]
*  Noem was asked about the constitutional protection by Democratic Senator Maggie Hassan of New [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=10.4s)]
*  Hampshire after pointing out that White House adviser Stephen Miller told reporters earlier [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=16.02s)]
*  this month that the administration was actively looking at suspending habeas corpus. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=22.68s)]
*  So Secretary Noem, what is habeas corpus? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=31.32s)]
*  Well habeas corpus is a constitutional right that the president has to be able to remove [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=35.28s)]
*  people from this country and suspend their right to suspend their right to. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=40.4s)]
*  Let me stop you ma'am. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=43.32s)]
*  Habeas corpus, excuse me, that's incorrect. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=44.32s)]
*  President Blinken used it. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=47.56s)]
*  Habeas corpus is the legal principle that requires that the government provide a public [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=50.48s)]
*  reason for detaining and imprisoning people. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=55.72s)]
*  If not for that protection, the government could simply arrest people, including American [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=59.04s)]
*  citizens and hold them indefinitely for no reason. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=63.32s)]
*  Habeas corpus is the foundational right that separates free societies like America from [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=67.2s)]
*  police states like North Korea. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=72.53999999999999s)]
*  So Secretary Noem, do you support the core protection that habeas corpus provides, that [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=74.54s)]
*  the government must provide a public reason in order to detain and imprison someone? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=80.18s)]
*  I support habeas corpus. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=86.26s)]
*  I also recognize that the president of the United States has the authority under the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=87.62s)]
*  constitution to decide if it should be suspended or not. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=91.46000000000001s)]
*  Katie Kay, after Senator Hassan there defined it for her, what do you make of her answer? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=95.22s)]
*  Look, I watched this. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=102.78s)]
*  There's no way that Kristi Noem went into that hearing without being briefed by her [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=103.97999999999999s)]
*  staff, right? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=107.69999999999999s)]
*  I mean, principals are prepped when they go into briefings like that. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=108.69999999999999s)]
*  It seems to me unlikely that she didn't know what habeas corpus is. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=112.06s)]
*  So you then have to think, was she acting for an audience of one and just trying to [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=115.69999999999999s)]
*  make her boss happy with her redefinition of it? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=121.02s)]
*  If that's the cynic of me, and maybe I've been in Washington too long, but otherwise [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=125.17999999999999s)]
*  she just was dumb and didn't know something that is basic about American law that she [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=129.62s)]
*  clearly should know, particularly given the position she's in and given all of the cases [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=134.58s)]
*  and the amount of times habeas corpus has come up in political and legal discussion [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=138.98000000000002s)]
*  in this town in the last couple of months. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=143.70000000000002s)]
*  I think she was performing. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=146.34s)]
*  You know, there are a lot of surprises that we've had over the past three months. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=148.74s)]
*  I think you're being very gracious, by the way. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=152.18s)]
*  So anyway, there are a lot of things that have surprised Americans over the last three [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=154.86s)]
*  months and a lot of things that people have gone, oh my God, you know, where's the America [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=159.82000000000002s)]
*  that I grew up knowing? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=165.26000000000002s)]
*  I'll tell you one thing that I have been so heartened by is the fact that so many Americans [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=166.54000000000002s)]
*  have shown pollsters, politicians, everybody else, they understand what due process is. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=175.62s)]
*  They understand what habeas corpus is. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=183.18s)]
*  They get it as they're right. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=185.86s)]
*  And I will keep going back to William Galtz and Wall Street Journal op-ed where he said, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=187.74s)]
*  elites, they don't think Americans understand that debate. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=193.94s)]
*  And he showed some poll results. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=200.62s)]
*  He said, oh no, they understand. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=202.46s)]
*  They understand and they like it very much. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=204.42000000000002s)]
*  They understand what separates America from most of the countries across the world. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=207.02s)]
*  And you look at Abrego Garcia, you look at that situation where in most folds, you know, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=213.42000000000002s)]
*  the White House is upside down by like 20 points because again, they don't love Abrego [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=219.42000000000002s)]
*  Garcia, but they're like, they said what the Supreme Court said, can't just throw somebody [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=224.74s)]
*  on a plane and make them disappear into an El Salvador prison. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=230.22s)]
*  And so in this respect, the American people are proving to be pretty stubborn about their [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=234.34s)]
*  rights, their due process rights. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=241.54s)]
*  Yeah, and it's a fundamental right and something that is part of the American foundation. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=243.74s)]
*  And we know, we've talked about on the show, the Trump White House reflexively always, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=247.82s)]
*  when they want to change the subject, they always go back to immigration. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=252.14000000000001s)]
*  I think that's a signature issue. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=254.46s)]
*  That's what's got them elected a couple of times, they believe. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=255.74s)]
*  And they did so with a real shock and awe approach this time. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=258.22s)]
*  But also those slickly produced promotional videos of those prisoners being put in, headshaving, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=261.66s)]
*  put into that El Salvador prison. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=268.02000000000004s)]
*  And that's backfired. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=270.26000000000005s)]
*  Polls suggest that Americans don't like that outside of perhaps the very core manga base. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=271.74s)]
*  And there's a recognition even in the White House, some of the people I've talked to, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=276.38000000000005s)]
*  this is Stephen Miller's plan, he's the lead architect of this, but he's had support from [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=279.5s)]
*  others that it hasn't quite landed the way they wanted. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=283.42s)]
*  Doesn't mean they're going to adjust approaches and they haven't yet. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=286.06s)]
*  They're certainly still trying to deport migrants without due process to other places. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=289.94s)]
*  But this hasn't been the political winner that they hoped it would be. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=293.74s)]
*  And there hasn't been the consistency because as Meek and I have explained that, you know, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=296.86s)]
*  in some of our off the record discussions with the White House, it's very clear that [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=301.06s)]
*  Donald Trump had told people around him, I want to avoid those pictures of mothers being [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=308.65999999999997s)]
*  separated from their children. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=316.5s)]
*  So telling people around him, that did me no favors in the first term. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=319.46s)]
*  But again, there seems to be an inconsistency approach because there's also the belief that [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=327.41999999999996s)]
*  these slick videos that have been highly produced of this seizure and dropping in notorious [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=331.97999999999996s)]
*  prison. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=343.18s)]
*  I didn't quite, and the words as we keep going to pop culture and the words of Will Ferrell [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=344.18s)]
*  and the other guys, that didn't turn out the way you expected, did it? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=351.42s)]
*  I mean, it's upside down. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=354.98s)]
*  It's interesting what moves the needle on this and it's visual stuff. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=357.3s)]
*  I mean, there was a young woman, a soft graduate student in Medford, Massachusetts, walking [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=361.02s)]
*  from her apartment to a meeting. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=366.5s)]
*  This is about six weeks or so ago and all of a sudden two black SUVs pull up alongside [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=370.56s)]
*  her, snatch her, put her in the SUV. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=375.28000000000003s)]
*  By the way, unidentified. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=378.64s)]
*  And it's on a cell phone. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=381.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=382.24s)]
*  And again, unidentified. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=383.24s)]
*  This doesn't look like America. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=384.24s)]
*  And what if that's your daughter? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=385.72s)]
*  What if that's your daughter and this is normal in the United States? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=387.92s)]
*  Everybody that looks, every father that looks at that is thinking, okay, what if that's [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=394.64s)]
*  And she's asking, who are you? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=398.86s)]
*  Who are you? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=400.82s)]
*  And they just say, come with me. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=402.2s)]
*  And nobody's showing them any identification. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=403.46s)]
*  Nobody's doing anything. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=406.3s)]
*  And they dump her in a car. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=407.72s)]
*  I mean, that's just, again, I don't care what your ideology is. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=408.72s)]
*  I don't care if you're like me and actually believe the border is there for a reason and [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=412.7s)]
*  people shouldn't come here illegally. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=417.48s)]
*  That's not how you proceed in this country. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=420.42s)]
*  That's why they're not getting the bounce off this thing that they thought they were [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=423.86s)]
*  going to get. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=426.5s)]
*  That's the biggest point. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWrE2QK0s7w&t=427.5s)]
