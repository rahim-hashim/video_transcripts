# Feet below casinos, over a thousand homeless live in Vegas' tunnels
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I)
*  According to a recent report from the federal government, homelessness in America has reached [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=0.0s)]
*  an all-time high. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=5.04s)]
*  More than 770,000 people experienced homelessness last year. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  That's an 18 percent increase over the previous year. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=10.88s)]
*  Let's bring in NBC News correspondent, NBC News Now Daily anchor Morgan Radford, who [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  has more reporting on this. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=19.92s)]
*  Morgan, great to see you. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=21.44s)]
*  What did you learn? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=22.44s)]
*  Hey there. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=23.44s)]
*  Really good morning. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=24.44s)]
*  I went there to see it firsthand, and I wanted to find out what it actually means to live [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=26.44s)]
*  in their underground world and meet the small team of people that's working to bring their [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=30.200000000000003s)]
*  situation to light. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  How long have you been in this tunnel? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  I've been in it for about a year. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  I've been in it for about a year. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  I've been in it for about a year. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  I've been in it for about a year. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  I've been in it for about a year. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  I've been in it for about a year. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  I've been in it for about a year. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  I've been in it for about a year. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  How long have you been in this tunnel? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=54.8s)]
*  In these tunnels? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=56.8s)]
*  About five years. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=58.8s)]
*  For a 39-year-old man who wants only to be known as Tree, this is home. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=60.8s)]
*  They had one homeless shelter that was overran, and I just followed the tracks and ended up down here. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=66.8s)]
*  That place, a network of tunnels stretching hundreds of miles, originally meant to divert [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=72.8s)]
*  rainwater and now home to an entire underground population, all living just a few feet under the bright lights of the Las Vegas Strip. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=78.72s)]
*  How many people do you estimate are living here right now? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=87.72s)]
*  Approximately 12 to 1500. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=90.72s)]
*  So we are three feet... [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=92.72s)]
*  ... beneath Caesar's Palace on the Las Vegas Strip. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=94.72s)]
*  You said it yourself, you've been here many times, you would never even know it was here. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=98.72s)]
*  I feel like I've spent so many times looking up at the lights I have never once looked down. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=101.72s)]
*  Rob Banghart works for Shine A Light, an organization that helps guide people out of homelessness through services like addiction treatment, mental health care, and access to housing. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=108.72s)]
*  He comes here with a team of caseworkers every Saturday, hoping to reach people like David. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=117.72s)]
*  Does it ever get hard to be in the dark for so many hours? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=123.72s)]
*  No. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=126.72s)]
*  No? You get used to it? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=127.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=129.72s)]
*  Rob was addicted to a number of substances and says he's now been clean for nearly seven years. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=130.72s)]
*  This is a world he once knew firsthand. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=135.52s)]
*  I was underground for about two and a half years. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=138.52s)]
*  I found somewhere that I could go and be left alone and not bothered and not have to worry about the direct sun or the wind or the randomness. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=140.52s)]
*  And there was a lot of chaos in my tunnel too, but it was like the devil I knew. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=147.52s)]
*  A devil in the darkness. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=151.52s)]
*  Erin, can you turn off that light so people can really feel just how dark and still it is down here? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=153.52s)]
*  Okay, turn it on. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=165.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=166.52s)]
*  I mean, that is powerful. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=167.52s)]
*  That's meaningful. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=169.52s)]
*  The choice or the circumstance that would bring you to this level of darkness, of desperation, of solitude. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=171.52s)]
*  We've made them feel so not a part of that they retreat underground because it's that guilt and shame of just walking around. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=180.52s)]
*  I haven't showered in a year. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=188.52s)]
*  You should have shaves. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=190.52s)]
*  Yeah, you feel I lived in the same world as you but not the same society. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=192.32000000000002s)]
*  Nationwide, the latest data shows more than 771,000 people experienced some kind of homelessness in 2024. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=196.32000000000002s)]
*  We want homes for the homeless. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=203.32000000000002s)]
*  A nationwide crisis playing out from New York. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=205.32000000000002s)]
*  Do not throw away my belonging. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=208.32000000000002s)]
*  Where an increase in evictions and an influx of asylum seekers has strained shelters. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=210.32000000000002s)]
*  You gotta go! [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=215.32000000000002s)]
*  To Hawaii, where a devastating wildfire affected thousands. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=217.32000000000002s)]
*  Everyone I know is now homeless. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=222.12s)]
*  The Trump administration has attempted to freeze some of the $5 billion allocated in 2021 for homelessness assistance. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=224.12s)]
*  NBC News reached out to the White House for comment but did not receive a response by deadline. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=231.12s)]
*  Rob worries recent cuts in federal funding will jeopardize services for people like Jay, who says he's lived in the tunnels for 13 years. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=236.12s)]
*  Why did you choose to live down here instead of live on the surface? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=245.12s)]
*  It doesn't matter where you are, you can't be there. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=248.92000000000002s)]
*  I'm just trying to stay out of sight, out of mind. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=250.92000000000002s)]
*  So this is more out of sight and out of mind than up top. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=252.92000000000002s)]
*  Do you want to go back to the surface? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  Um, it doesn't even matter. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=257.92s)]
*  I mean, like I mean, I have no... [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=260.92s)]
*  I just don't care. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=265.92s)]
*  A life in limbo, hidden in plain sight. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=267.92s)]
*  Clark County, which oversees homeless resources for the Las Vegas Strip, did not respond to our request for comment. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=271.72s)]
*  We also reached out to the City of Las Vegas, which handles homeless outreach outside of the Strip. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=278.72s)]
*  And they said that the city's Courtyard Homeless Resource Center provides a range of services for the homeless available 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=284.72s)]
*  Morgan, terrific reporting and so almost dystopic, this idea of all cities, particularly Las Vegas. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=294.72s)]
*  Such a monument to excess above the ground and yet literally feet below the surface, this whole underworld and tough conditions. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=300.52000000000004s)]
*  So talk to us about the funding involved here and what resources are needed. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=307.52000000000004s)]
*  Are they in jeopardy? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=312.52000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, the resources frankly are in jeopardy because you're not only talking about things, you know, that deal with housing first solutions, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=314.52000000000004s)]
*  but you're also talking about the underlying issues like addiction, which is what you saw many of the people we interviewed were suffering from. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=320.52000000000004s)]
*  And so when you look at places like putting the CDC funding on the chopping block, a lot of people don't realize that the funds that are fighting the opioid crisis specifically, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=327.32s)]
*  many of those are funneled through the CDC. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=336.32s)]
*  So how do you have a war on drugs if you're not providing the resources to actually fight that? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=338.32s)]
*  And then it's not just the resources, it's also just the cohesion and the network of coordination. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=342.32s)]
*  So if you don't have an address, how do you get your government documents? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=348.32s)]
*  How do you navigate the medical system? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=352.32s)]
*  How do you get transitional housing? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=354.32s)]
*  So coordinating all those resources is hard when you're not having a starting address in the first place. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=357.12s)]
*  Such a fascinating look at this, literally below the surface. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=363.12s)]
*  Morgan Radford, just an excellent report. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=365.12s)]
*  Thank you so much, Morgan. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=367.12s)]
*  Still ahead. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=369.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnP3Xjlv2I&t=386.32s)]
