# Trump should make a good-faith effort at diplomacy in Iran: Richard Haass
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0)
*  All right, let's get to our top story this morning. President Trump still weighing his [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=0.0s)]
*  options on how to deal with Iran. Yesterday morning, he told reporters he has not yet [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=4.96s)]
*  made a final decision, saying Iran has suggested coming to the White House for talks, but it [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  might be too late. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=16.84s)]
*  Iran's got a lot of trouble, and they want to negotiate. And I said, why didn't you negotiate [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  with me before all this death and destruction? Why didn't you negotiate? I said to the people, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=25.4s)]
*  why didn't you negotiate with me two weeks ago? You could have done fine. You would have [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=30.52s)]
*  had a country. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=35.72s)]
*  Unconditional, sir. That means I've had it. Okay, I've had it. I give up. I'm no more. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=36.72s)]
*  Then we go blow up all the nuclear stuff that's all over the place. Look, nothing's finished [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=43.72s)]
*  until it's finished. You know, war is very complex. A lot of bad things can happen. A [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=49.72s)]
*  lot of turns are made. So I don't know. I wouldn't say that we want anything yet. I [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=54.16s)]
*  would say that we sure as hell made a lot of progress. And we'll see. The next week [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=58.879999999999995s)]
*  is going to be very big, maybe less than a week, maybe less. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=64.24s)]
*  We've got David Ignatius here. We're going to be going to him in a second. But I will [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=68.56s)]
*  say you parsed the role of that and what you see is somebody who still may be looking for [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=72.2s)]
*  a deal and who is acknowledging what everybody who's seriously looking at this knows. That, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=76.5s)]
*  as David said yesterday, it just starts with the bombing of Iran. The spin off from this, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=83.16s)]
*  I'm not going to even say could be, most likely would be just as messy as what happened after [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=92.36s)]
*  you replaced a regime in Iraq. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=99.36s)]
*  Well, Iran denies ever asking to meet at the White House, writing in a statement, quote, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=102.48s)]
*  Iran does not negotiate under duress. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=107.8s)]
*  That is not true. They will negotiate under duress to save their regime if they can. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=111.08s)]
*  The president did meet with security advisors in the situation room yesterday. As for the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  situation on the ground, Iran and Israel are still trading fire. Earlier this morning, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=123.96s)]
*  an Iranian missile struck a hotel in southern Israel, though Iranian officials say they [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=129.24s)]
*  were a hospital, sorry, not a hotel, though Iranian officials say they were aiming for [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=134.92s)]
*  a nearby military site. The direct hit caused extensive damage to the facility and seriously [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=140.64s)]
*  injured at least six people. Several residential buildings in Tel Aviv were hit as well, injuring [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=148.48s)]
*  at least 47 people. According to the Times of Israel, the Israeli military says Iran [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=156.23999999999998s)]
*  launched roughly 30 ballistic missiles this morning. In Iran, Israel hit a heavy water [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=162.08s)]
*  reactor. Early this morning at a news conference yesterday, an Israeli military spokesperson [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=169.08s)]
*  said the IDF had launched three waves of aerial attacks from Tuesday into Wednesday. The waves [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=174.60000000000002s)]
*  involved dozens of warplanes dispatched to strike over 60 targets in Tehran and in western [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=181.32000000000002s)]
*  Iran. Citing a Washington-based Iranian human rights group, the Associated Press reports [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=188.28s)]
*  at least 639 people have been killed in Iran since last Friday. With us we have the President [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=194.32000000000002s)]
*  Emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations, Richard Haass. Columnist and associate editor [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=202.28s)]
*  for the Washington Post, David Ignatius. Managing editor at the Bulwark, Sam Stein. Thank you [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=206.96s)]
*  for doing way too early. And national security reporter for the Wall Street Journal, Alex [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=213.12s)]
*  Ward is with us this morning. You won't be thanking Sam after we talk about the Red Sox [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=218.28s)]
*  for another two and a half minutes. Oh, God. So, David Ignatius, we've had four and a half [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=222.04s)]
*  years to study Donald Trump and actually to be able to pick out some patterns as disruptive [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=227.44s)]
*  and random as it may be. And I would say the one area where he seems to be conservative [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=235.62s)]
*  with a small C and perhaps the only area that I can think of is actually the use of military [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=243.44s)]
*  force. And I'm just curious what you're hearing after he spoke on the White House lawn yesterday [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=250.64000000000001s)]
*  talking about all of the possible complications that are sure to follow a strike against Iran [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=258.12s)]
*  and how he balances that, which is extraordinarily important and I'm glad he's thinking about [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=265.2s)]
*  that with people in his ear saying this is your chance to take out a regime that's been [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=271.08s)]
*  the epicenter of anti-American terror since 1979. What are you hearing? So, Joe, I think [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=279.15999999999997s)]
*  you describe it accurately. This is a moment of high drama. President Trump is surrounded [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=285.71999999999997s)]
*  by aides, some arguing you got a bomb, Mr. President, others arguing let's try to negotiate. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=292.12s)]
*  I'm told that he made the decision Monday that he's prepared to use the U.S. bunker [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=298.96000000000004s)]
*  buster bomb over Fordow but is not yet prepared to actually deploy it and still hopes that [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=304.64000000000004s)]
*  he can somehow find a path to negotiation. He said as much yesterday talking about the [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=312.0s)]
*  Iranians wanting to come to the White House, a deal is still possible. He loves the drama [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=317.48s)]
*  of this. He said yesterday he won't make a decision until the last second. So I think [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=322.6s)]
*  negotiation is still possible. In some ways, it's Trump's preferred course. His problem, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=328.84s)]
*  I'm told, is that there's just a lack of trust on the Iranian side. They see him as the person [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=334.59999999999997s)]
*  who basically chucked the Iran nuclear deal when he was president in his first term. They [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=339.59999999999997s)]
*  think that maybe he's been straying them along in the negotiations so far. The Iranian condition, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=346.03999999999996s)]
*  I'm told, is the bombing must stop and then they're prepared to sit down and talk with [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=351.71999999999997s)]
*  Trump or some group. The Europeans are meeting Friday to talk about diplomacy. I just would [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=358.48s)]
*  add one detail that I was thinking about last night about a somewhat similar moment. In [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=365.52000000000004s)]
*  1962, President Kennedy was surrounded by advisors during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Some of them [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=372.84000000000003s)]
*  said bomb Cuba. Many were preparing an invasion of Cuba. Some wanted to sink the Soviet ship [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=379.04s)]
*  that was steaming toward Cuba. Kennedy, surrounded by all these competing voices, stepped out [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=386.52000000000004s)]
*  of what was called the EXCOM, the executive committee that was making decisions. He needed [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=393.28000000000003s)]
*  some time alone and he went with his brother. He came up with the most unusual double-speak [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=397.92s)]
*  deal with the Russians where he said one thing publicly and did something quite different [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=404.76s)]
*  privately. He ended up with a deal that solved the Cuban Missile Crisis. I couldn't help [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=408.68s)]
*  thinking last night, this is a similar situation. I hope President Trump in the hours, days [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=413.8s)]
*  remaining to make this very difficult decision can step away from all these competing voices [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=420.2s)]
*  and think creatively. We say JFK stepped out of the box. If it's possible for Donald Trump [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=425.96000000000004s)]
*  to step out of his box, he might get to a point where he sees a way to resolve this [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=431.32s)]
*  that serves our interests, serves Israel's and leaves Iran not completely obliterated [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=436.7s)]
*  by that kind of mess that would be hard to put back together. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=443.8s)]
*  Richard Haass, like you, to weigh the two competing scenarios here and offer what advice [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=446.8s)]
*  you would give to the President. On one side you have the opportunity to finish the nuclear [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=460.8s)]
*  program most likely or certainly dent the nuclear program of, again, the country that [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=471.5s)]
*  has been the epicenter of terror since 1979. That's on one side. On the other side, of [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=478.79999999999995s)]
*  course, is what we all remember following the March 2003 invasion of Iraq where for [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=483.79999999999995s)]
*  a month or two everybody was celebrating America's extraordinary success and it turned into a [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=490.2s)]
*  decade-long nightmare that we still haven't seen the final consequences of that invasion, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=495.44s)]
*  of that regime change. What advice would these two competing interests, what advice would [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=503.24s)]
*  you give the President or any President in this situation? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=510.24s)]
*  I'll tell you in 30 seconds what I'd tell this President, but the first thing I think [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=513.24s)]
*  to recognize, Joe, is we've got to get rid of words like solve this once and for all, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=517.94s)]
*  finish off the Iranian nuclear program. It's just not going to happen. It's not the way [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=522.24s)]
*  history works. It's not the way these things work. Second of all, neither option is particularly [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=527.24s)]
*  attractive right now. If we use military force, we get tied down in the Middle East again [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=532.24s)]
*  quite possibly. We'll see how Iran retaliates against U.S. troops in the region, what have [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=537.24s)]
*  you. It normalizes the idea that great powers can use military force. I bet the Chinese and [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=543.24s)]
*  the Russians and some others might be taking notes. Everybody sees gathering threats out [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=550.24s)]
*  there they might want to act against. So the downsides of using force are real. The elements [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=555.24s)]
*  of the Iranian program will survive. If you read The Economist this week on the dossier, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=560.24s)]
*  you understand that there's all sorts of things we still don't know completely about. The [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=565.24s)]
*  Iranians have squirreled away all sorts of equipment and material all over the country, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=569.24s)]
*  I would expect. So we will, as you used the phrase, make a major dent in it if we use [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=575.24s)]
*  military force. But one, they'll be able to reconstruct it. And second of all, they'll be [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=580.24s)]
*  determined to. Indeed, they're probably already determined to. They've lost their proxies for [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=584.24s)]
*  the most part. Israel's acting with impunity over their territory. So my guess is most Iranians [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=589.24s)]
*  will say the lesson we need to draw is that we actually need nuclear weapons in order to [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=594.24s)]
*  prevent this sort of thing from happening. I actually think the best thing at this point the [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=600.24s)]
*  president could do is do a sequential approach. Go to the Iranians and say we'd like to work [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=604.24s)]
*  this out through negotiation. He should stop tweeting, by the way. It's not unconditional [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=609.24s)]
*  surrender. The Iranians are going to have to compromise significantly, but there might be [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=614.24s)]
*  some things they don't. We're not going to get everything we want. But I would certainly try [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=619.24s)]
*  an ambitious diplomatic approach. And that way if he does have to use force, it seems to me it's [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=624.24s)]
*  always better to have tried the diplomatic. The parallel I'll give is George H.W. Bush. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=630.24s)]
*  And David used the Cuban Missile Crisis. Let me use the Gulf War. We had Resolution 678. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=636.24s)]
*  We gave Saddam Hussein every opportunity to get out of Kuwait through diplomacy and so forth. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=642.24s)]
*  And then when it didn't work, then we used force. And because we had tried, we had the country and [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=648.24s)]
*  the world behind us. So I think if I were Donald Trump, I would make a good faith effort at [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=654.24s)]
*  diplomacy to get the Iranians to give up their enriched uranium, to agree to inspections and so [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=658.24s)]
*  forth. You'd offer them sanctions relief. You wouldn't attack their country. The regime would survive. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3my3ofDjXo0&t=664.24s)]
