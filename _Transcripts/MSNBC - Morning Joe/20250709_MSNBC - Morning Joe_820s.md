# 'A gut punch for this community': More than 160 missing in Kerr County after floods
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs)
*  Joining us now, NBC News senior national correspondent Jay Gray live this morning from Kerrville, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=0.0s)]
*  Texas. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=5.32s)]
*  Jay, what's the latest today? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=6.32s)]
*  Well, Mika, I think we need to have some perspective here. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=8.84s)]
*  You know, we've been told dozens were missing for days. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=14.52s)]
*  The numbers were, and I'm quoting here from officials, a lot. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=18.28s)]
*  I don't think anyone expected to hear the governor reveal that there are more than 160 [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=21.64s)]
*  missing just here in Kerr County alone, over 170 across the six counties affected by this [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=26.2s)]
*  flooding. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=31.2s)]
*  It's been a gut punch for this community, which is already reeling, by the way. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=32.2s)]
*  We're along the Guadalupe River. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=36.88s)]
*  You can see some of the debris here. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  This is the kind of thing that these first response teams are going through now and trying [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=40.3s)]
*  to locate those missing, some of the larger pieces of debris, like these huge trees that [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=46.7s)]
*  were just toppled and snapped. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=52.6s)]
*  They're going through that. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  They're damaging people. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=55.959999999999994s)]
*  If you have something like this on your property, if you have damage to your home, don't clear [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=56.959999999999994s)]
*  it out. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=61.239999999999995s)]
*  Let us come through and make sure that there's no one trapped underneath all of this and [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  make sure that there are not missing people somewhere there. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=66.32s)]
*  We've had stories already of people who have been swept away for 15, even 20 miles. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=71.0s)]
*  And so there's a huge area to cover. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=77.84s)]
*  And that's the next step in all of this as they begin day six of the search and recovery [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=80.08s)]
*  getting into some of those areas they've yet to get into using some high profile military [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=85.6s)]
*  vehicles to do just that. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=91.16s)]
*  And I've talked to a couple of the response team members last night, one who said point [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=93.68s)]
*  blank, Mika, we're not surprised at this number. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=100.12s)]
*  We've seen the devastation firsthand and we're not surprised that over 160 are missing in [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=104.6s)]
*  Kirk County. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=109.76s)]
*  I talked to one man from the Cajun army who told me he thinks that number is going to [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=110.84s)]
*  climb. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=115.96000000000001s)]
*  So, Jay, I'm curious. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=120.4s)]
*  I know it hindsight's 2020, but for those living near the Guadalupe River and we have [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=123.24000000000001s)]
*  camps and campers and also people who are camping and people who live there, are questions [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=128.76s)]
*  beginning to arise about the warning system that was not there for them? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=135.24s)]
*  Because this is an area where for camps, for children, they choose not to have cell phones. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=141.2s)]
*  And for people who live near the river, often cell phone service is spotty at best. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=147.44s)]
*  Yeah, no, I think you make a great point, Mika, and absolutely there is concern about [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=156.68s)]
*  that. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=161.56s)]
*  We've been back and forth for years with council members here, with the local government [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=162.56s)]
*  about funding some warning sirens and getting a proper warning system in place. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=166.72s)]
*  The state, as at times said, will give you a percentage of what it will cost, but we're [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=172.92000000000002s)]
*  not going to pay for the whole thing. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=176.6s)]
*  And so they've just passed. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=179.08s)]
*  I mean, I think it's important to reference the city of Comfort, which is not far from [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=180.08s)]
*  here and dealt with the same type of flooding, lost no one. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=184.32s)]
*  And they do have warning sirens there. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=187.96s)]
*  We've heard from the governor. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=190.72s)]
*  We've heard from the lieutenant governor. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  They do have a special session. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=193.07999999999998s)]
*  They say that they are going to pay now. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=195.1s)]
*  The state is going to pay for some type of warning system that includes sirens. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=197.06s)]
*  They have what is about a 30 billion at last count rainy day fund, they called it. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=201.94s)]
*  So they're going to pull that money from there and do that. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=207.26s)]
*  But a lot of people here want to know living in such peril, knowing that they are in flash [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=210.78s)]
*  flood alley, as it's called. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=216.54s)]
*  Why hasn't this happened before? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=218.42s)]
*  How did we get to this point? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=219.94s)]
*  NBC News senior national correspondent Jay Gray reporting live this morning from Kerrville, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=222.9s)]
*  Texas once again. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=227.78s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=229.06s)]
*  And Jay brings up a great point. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=230.62s)]
*  I mean, you have you have these rainy day funds for a reason. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=232.46s)]
*  And when you have when you have local governments unable to fund this, when you're in flash [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=235.42s)]
*  flood alley, you need the state to step in. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=242.5s)]
*  The state can't afford to step in. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=246.14s)]
*  The federal government needs to step in to protect the people of Texas and to protect [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=247.77999999999997s)]
*  other people across across the country. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=251.89999999999998s)]
*  In this case, they just didn't do it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=254.1s)]
*  They were sitting on a fat rainy day fund. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=255.82s)]
*  And unfortunately, the literal rains came and a lot of people are dead now because they [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=259.21999999999997s)]
*  didn't have adequate warning systems and that they should have had. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=265.5s)]
*  And some of that is expressed in the editorial board of the San Antonio Express News, which [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=269.38s)]
*  is out with a new piece entitled Texas officials need to stop scapegoating the National Weather [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=275.66s)]
*  Service. It reads in part this numerous meteorologists have said the National Weather [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=280.18s)]
*  Service, despite troubling and short sighted federal cuts, did its job, noting that [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=285.34000000000003s)]
*  forecasts were as accurate as could be expected and that the warnings were timely. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=290.06s)]
*  But one does not have to be a meteorologist or atmospheric science expert to understand [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=295.70000000000005s)]
*  that forecasts are estimates, general guides really about the possibility of whether no [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=301.22s)]
*  one should expect to the inch precision rather than shifting blame or nitpicking a [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=307.1s)]
*  forecast after a catastrophe that has killed 28 children. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=312.54s)]
*  A more productive line of questioning is why so many people did not receive emergency [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=317.18s)]
*  alerts or at least receive the alerts with enough time to act. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=322.14s)]
*  Why did the so-called last mile of communication break down? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=326.42s)]
*  As we grieve this catastrophe, we also refuse to consign it to inevitability. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=330.66s)]
*  We yearn for the day when Texas is proactive in working to prevent tragedies rather [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=336.38s)]
*  than reactive in their aftermath. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=342.74s)]
*  And the piece there came from the board of the San Antonio Express News. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=345.02000000000004s)]
*  And Jonathan O'Meara, again, let's let's underline the fact that Texas had a massive rainy [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=349.74s)]
*  day fund. And we're not just talking about Texas here. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=354.66s)]
*  We could talk about a lot of states that have have moved over the past 20, 30 years [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=359.78000000000003s)]
*  to slash as much government as they could slash. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=367.90000000000003s)]
*  We saw it actually on the federal level where, you know, they were just slashing government [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=371.62s)]
*  services without really much of a second thought. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=376.5s)]
*  That, of course, probably has nothing to do with this. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=379.74s)]
*  But I'm just talking about a general attitude that on the federal, state and local level, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=382.7s)]
*  slashing all governments. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=390.02s)]
*  So the more government services you can slash, the better. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=391.46s)]
*  Well, tell you what, that's not always the case. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=394.06s)]
*  And, you know, we always see these senators stand up and protest when you're trying to [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=397.3s)]
*  send FEMA assistance or emergency assistance to other states. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=403.46s)]
*  But then when it's their state that's affected, they're first in line. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=408.62s)]
*  We see people from states that are affected trying to make political light, like, for [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=412.34s)]
*  instance, out of the hurricanes in North Carolina last year, trying to scapegoat FEMA, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=419.09999999999997s)]
*  trying to make people in North Carolina not trust FEMA. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=425.5s)]
*  And they do that for political purposes. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=429.05999999999995s)]
*  But then when something like this happens, they're the first to run to the microphone [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=432.38s)]
*  and say, how dare people try to use this terrible tragedy to politicize, to bring [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=436.54s)]
*  politics into it? Just a reality they have. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=445.82s)]
*  I mean, there has to be an understanding with all members of Congress, especially members [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=448.46000000000004s)]
*  of Congress from states that don't want to spend money. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=456.3s)]
*  You know, you got to do the basics. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=460.54s)]
*  You got to take care of your people. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=462.90000000000003s)]
*  If you're in Texas, you got to take care of your people that are in a flash flood alley. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=465.22s)]
*  If you're in northwest Florida, you got to make sure and they do make sure you got to [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=472.26s)]
*  make sure your people in northwest Florida know when the hurricanes are coming or know [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=476.98s)]
*  when the forest fires are coming in California. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=481.94s)]
*  And right now, there's just not that understanding for a lot of local governments. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=484.7s)]
*  They just either misuse the money or are slash emergency responses thinking, oh, this is [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=489.46000000000004s)]
*  going to make me look fiscally conservative. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=496.5s)]
*  No, it's going to make you look responsible when little children are sleeping in cabins [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=498.26s)]
*  and they're not getting the emergency warnings that could have saved their life. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=504.54s)]
*  And as Jay Gray just said, you got to come for Texas. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=509.02000000000004s)]
*  They had the emergency systems. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=511.54s)]
*  They had the sirens. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=513.98s)]
*  They had nobody die in their communities. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=515.7s)]
*  Yeah, no, the point of government, the point of government is to keep its citizens safe, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=519.06s)]
*  is to take whatever steps are necessary to do so. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=524.14s)]
*  And we know we've reported the times I believe had first that there are people in that [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=526.7s)]
*  area who turned down funding some of the emergency systems because they didn't want a [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=531.9399999999999s)]
*  tax increase. As you just noted, the state has been sitting on a rainy day fund that [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=536.54s)]
*  should have been used. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=540.42s)]
*  And you're right. A disaster like this should not be politicized. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=541.54s)]
*  And but far too often it has become so where we have seen we've seen this administration, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=545.42s)]
*  the Trump administration threatened to disband FEMA entirely to put the onus on the states. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=552.1s)]
*  We know in President Trump's first term, he threatened to withhold federal funds, places [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=556.18s)]
*  like California after forest fires because of political disagreements. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=561.82s)]
*  This is something that should be above that. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=566.18s)]
*  And now we just as we look at these photos and hear these terrible stories, I mean, the [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=569.34s)]
*  final number, the final death toll is going to be unbearable. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=575.14s)]
*  You know, hundreds more still missing as the state pledges to keep to keep searching. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=578.26s)]
*  As for the federal response, President Trump confirmed during a cabinet meeting yesterday [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=583.94s)]
*  that he will travel to Texas to visit that devastated area later this week. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=588.14s)]
*  We also heard from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=592.38s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=595.5s)]
*  I'll be going down on Friday with First Lady. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=597.78s)]
*  We would be taking a trip and we don't want to get in anyone's way because, you know, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=601.74s)]
*  that's what happens. The president goes and everyone's around focused on. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=606.38s)]
*  I don't want anyone to focus on us, but it's possible they could have they could have some [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=610.54s)]
*  money saved still. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=616.58s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of areas. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=617.9s)]
*  It's a big area and probably unlikely at this point, but there could be this. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=619.94s)]
*  They're thinking it could be the possibility, but what a tragic situation. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=627.14s)]
*  We as a federal government don't manage these disasters. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=633.66s)]
*  The state does. We come in and support them. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=637.3000000000001s)]
*  And that's exactly what we did here in this situation. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=640.1s)]
*  We're cutting through the paperwork of the old FEMA, streamlining it much like your [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=643.26s)]
*  vision of how FEMA should operate. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=647.14s)]
*  And it's been a much better response to help these families get through this terrible [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=649.38s)]
*  situation. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=654.18s)]
*  And as I just mentioned, this tragedy in Texas comes as the administration has been [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=655.54s)]
*  moving to cut disaster response and relief agencies and as the president himself has [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=659.62s)]
*  previously talked about getting rid of FEMA. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=665.0999999999999s)]
*  But in the immediate aftermath of the catastrophic Texas flooding, President Trump told [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=668.4599999999999s)]
*  reporters over the weekend that this isn't the right time to talk about scrapping the [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=673.7399999999999s)]
*  agency. When asked on Monday whether the president was reconsidering his plan to [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=677.54s)]
*  eliminate FEMA, White House Press Secretary Carolyn Levitt told reporters that it was, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=682.26s)]
*  quote, a policy discussion that will continue. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=686.58s)]
*  So, Joe and Mika, this is something that the president right now is trying to push to [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=690.38s)]
*  the side. You know, he's going on Friday. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=694.5s)]
*  The federal government is pledging to step up. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=696.46s)]
*  But he also has not backed down his previous thoughts that this should be something the [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=698.18s)]
*  federal government shouldn't be in the business of doing. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=703.46s)]
*  It should be handed entirely to the states. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=705.8199999999999s)]
*  And that alarms a number of people. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=707.86s)]
*  Well, and the states just aren't capable of it. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=710.5s)]
*  States aren't capable of it. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=714.74s)]
*  We saw we've seen that time and time again. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=716.74s)]
*  We saw it in Hurricane Katrina. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=719.94s)]
*  The biggest mistake that George W. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=721.46s)]
*  Bush made was thinking that the governors of Mississippi and Louisiana and the mayor of [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=725.62s)]
*  the mayor of New Orleans were going to be able to take care of that hurricane. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=734.3000000000001s)]
*  And they were just incapable. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=740.46s)]
*  And so the federal government came in belatedly. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=742.38s)]
*  There was there was so much suffering. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=745.58s)]
*  There was so much devastation because they didn't get in there quickly enough. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=747.98s)]
*  So, yeah, listen, there's some things the local government can't do. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=753.5400000000001s)]
*  And then the state government has to get involved. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=757.7800000000001s)]
*  There's some things the state government can't do. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=759.6600000000001s)]
*  And that's when the federal government has to get involved. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=761.4200000000001s)]
*  Most states, even a big state like Texas, a rich state like Texas, one of the richest [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=763.5s)]
*  states in America, they don't have the ability that the federal government has in times of [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=769.7s)]
*  emergencies, in times of disasters. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=774.98s)]
*  And so, however, they decide they want to reorganize FEMA, they're not going to reorganize [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=778.0600000000001s)]
*  it on the backs of states, because if they do, they're going to see a lot more suffering. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=782.98s)]
*  It seems to me that it would bounce back politically as well, because it's not like [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=787.74s)]
*  they're not going to be natural disasters. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=791.5s)]
*  Of course. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9JQ7ST8GRs&t=793.2199999999999s)]
