# 'I'm shocked': Joe stunned by Hegseth's pausing weapons to Ukraine without informing WH
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ)
*  President Trump is expressing growing frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin promising [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=0.0s)]
*  to boost U.S. military aid to Ukraine just days after the Pentagon ordered a pause in [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=6.08s)]
*  critical weapons deliveries to Kiev. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=12.36s)]
*  During yesterday's Cabinet meeting, reporters asked the president who ordered the initial [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=14.96s)]
*  pause on Ukraine assistance. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=19.84s)]
*  Last week, the Pentagon paused some shipments of weapons to Ukraine. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=21.52s)]
*  Did you approve of that pause? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  We want to put defensive weapons because Putin is not treating human beings right. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=27.8s)]
*  He's killing too many people. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=34.32s)]
*  So we're sending some defensive weapons to Ukraine, and I've approved that. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=36.04s)]
*  So who ordered a pause last week? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=41.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=42.96s)]
*  Why don't you tell me? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=43.96s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=44.96s)]
*  CNN reports Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth did not inform the White House before he authorized [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=45.96s)]
*  a pause on weapons shipments to Ukraine last week. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=52.84s)]
*  Wait. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=55.92s)]
*  According to five sources familiar with the matter. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=56.96s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=59.36s)]
*  A secretary of defense? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=60.6s)]
*  A secretary of defense pauses weapons transfers and you don't tell the commander in chief? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=62.2s)]
*  And one of the two most important, like, foreign policy issues that are going on right now, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  a war that the president promised to stop and you have a sect-deaf just winging it, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=80.0s)]
*  not telling the commander in chief? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=88.2s)]
*  We'll get to that in a second. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=92.44s)]
*  Here's the president who is the commander in chief who... [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=94.16s)]
*  He's the one in charge. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=97.64s)]
*  Is in charge. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=99.24s)]
*  Is this like Hegseth giving Elon Musk a secret briefing on China before the White House found [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=101.47999999999999s)]
*  out about it? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=108.9s)]
*  Like what? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=109.9s)]
*  Like, is he going to do whatever he wants to do? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=110.9s)]
*  Well, here's President Trump explaining to reporters why he wants to continue sending [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=115.14s)]
*  weapons aid to Ukraine. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=120.58000000000001s)]
*  We're not happy with Putin. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=124.06s)]
*  I'm not happy with Putin. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=125.06s)]
*  I can tell you that much right now because he's killing a lot of people and a lot of [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=126.54s)]
*  them are his soldiers, his soldiers and their soldiers mostly. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=131.1s)]
*  And it's now up to 7,000 a week and I'm not happy with Putin. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=135.74s)]
*  And I don't know, we get a lot of bull****** thrown at us by Putin for you want to know [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=141.10000000000002s)]
*  the truth. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=146.34s)]
*  He's very nice all the time, but it turns out to be meaningless. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=147.34s)]
*  You know, Jonathan O'Meara, you reported on this several weeks ago that, you know, Donald [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=152.86s)]
*  Trump wanted to be different and we can... [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=158.10000000000002s)]
*  He's talked about this relationship with Vladimir Putin, but let's just assume he wanted [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=163.82s)]
*  America to have better relations with Russia and he thought that he would be the guy that [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=169.18s)]
*  would be able to do it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=173.38s)]
*  You wrote a couple of weeks ago that he has given Vladimir Putin enough rope and he continues [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=175.38s)]
*  to. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=183.26s)]
*  And Putin just won't take, you know, he won't take the victory that Donald Trump is trying [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=184.68s)]
*  to hand him, saying, listen, the war can come to an end, you can have Crimea, you can have [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=191.22s)]
*  these... [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=196.26s)]
*  And by the way, these are the same things that the Biden administration were whispering [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=197.26s)]
*  as well, saying, you know, I know Mark Milley was saying Russia's not going to get to Kiev [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=200.57999999999998s)]
*  and Ukraine's not going to get back all of their land. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=207.82s)]
*  He told me that back in 2023, right? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=209.98s)]
*  So this is nothing shocking. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=213.26s)]
*  But Donald Trump continues to give Vladimir Putin benefit of the doubt. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=215.26s)]
*  Vladimir Putin continues to mock him, ridicule him, thumb his nose at him. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=221.02s)]
*  And as your reporting suggested a couple of weeks ago, the president is only going to [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=227.9s)]
*  have so much patience and it looks like his patience is running out with a guy who continues [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=232.58s)]
*  to ridicule, ignore and mock him. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=238.78s)]
*  Yeah, Putin has only escalated this conflict. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=241.1s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=243.06s)]
*  I mean, I reported some time ago, President Trump, he simply wants this war to end. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=244.06s)]
*  He does want to improve relations with Russia. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=247.58s)]
*  We can weigh in on that another time, whether that's worth it. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=250.5s)]
*  But that's what he wants to do. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=252.86s)]
*  He wants business deals with Russia, rare mineral deals with Russia. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=253.86s)]
*  He wants it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=257.54s)]
*  And he also wants simply the fighting to end. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=258.54s)]
*  It's a largely frozen conflict. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=259.98s)]
*  They have proposed sort of ending things along these lines. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=261.74s)]
*  Ukraine is objected to some of that. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=264.86s)]
*  But Ukraine, let's remember, agreed a long time ago to the U.S. proposal for a ceasefire. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=266.54s)]
*  Russia still has not. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=272.1s)]
*  And in fact, it's Moscow is stepping up their attacks. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=273.1s)]
*  And we should note President Trump frustrated yesterday also at the Pentagon. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=275.78s)]
*  Eldridge Colby is another name to keep in mind here. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=279.62s)]
*  Pentagon, top official there, policy planning. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=282.06s)]
*  He and Hegsett seem to be the ones behind this pause while they did an inventory of [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=285.06s)]
*  U.S. arsenal. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=289.38s)]
*  Seemingly the president doesn't agree. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=290.82s)]
*  Can I ask you about that? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=291.82s)]
*  I mean, that rises to such a high level. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=293.22s)]
*  I'm shocked that any secretary of defense would freeze weapons transfers to a country [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=295.86s)]
*  that is on the front lines of a hot war in Europe. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=303.98s)]
*  I mean, this reminds me of him deciding to give Elon Musk, according to reports, a secret [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=308.26s)]
*  briefing on China before the White House found out and said, no, no, no, no, don't. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=315.62s)]
*  Donald Trump coming out going, he's got economic interest in China. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=321.38s)]
*  Don't give him that briefing. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=325.65999999999997s)]
*  But we see this again. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=327.94s)]
*  I mean, this is pretty shocking, isn't it, that you'd have a secretary of defense unilaterally [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=329.78s)]
*  make this decision according to five different sources? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=336.76s)]
*  Tell me what you're hearing about. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=339.68s)]
*  Did the president know anything about this? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=341.0s)]
*  Yeah, did Pete Hegsett blindsiding the commander in chief on an issue this big? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=344.12s)]
*  Yeah, now look, we certainly know in the past, President Trump is quick to distance himself [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=349.04s)]
*  from things that may be unpopular. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=353.84s)]
*  He claims he doesn't know about them. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=357.56s)]
*  Later, it turns out he did. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=359.03999999999996s)]
*  But in this case, it does appear that this did not go to the Oval Office. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=360.36s)]
*  This was a decision made at the Pentagon. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=363.64s)]
*  They were doing a weapons inventory. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=365.24s)]
*  What do we have left in our stockpiles? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=366.98s)]
*  And to be fair, there are concerns across the defense community about the low supplies [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=368.52s)]
*  that the U.S. has. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=373.6s)]
*  But there was not seemingly an order from the White House to stop these shipments to [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=375.56s)]
*  chief. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=380.88s)]
*  Of course. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=381.88s)]
*  Like if there are low supplies in our weapons, shouldn't the commander in chief be told that [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=382.88s)]
*  and say, Mr. President, commander in chief, what would you like to do? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=386.2s)]
*  Yeah, that would seem, that would be the correct order, the sequence here. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=390.36s)]
*  And that was not the case here. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=394.36s)]
*  And there's been real frustration, and we know this, we've talked about this on the [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=396.47999999999996s)]
*  show, growing frustration within the West Wing as to how Defense Secretary Hegsett has [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=399.28s)]
*  been running the Pentagon, not just Signalgate, but sort of the day-to-day operations there [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=403.82s)]
*  and how he's managing and has so few voices around him in the Pentagon that the White [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=409.03999999999996s)]
*  House trusts. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=414.0s)]
*  So there's a lot to explore here. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=415.0s)]
*  Let's bring in a great panel to help us do so. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=417.84s)]
*  U.S. NBC contributor Mark Barnicle joins us, as well as New York Times opinion columnist [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=420.0s)]
*  David French and contributing writer for The Atlantic and a former speechwriter for President [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=423.96000000000004s)]
*  George W. Bush, Pete Wehner. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=428.76s)]
*  He's also a senior fellow at the Trinity Forum, a faith-based nonprofit. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=430.52000000000004s)]
*  Great to see you all, guys. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=435.64000000000004s)]
*  David, let's start with you. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=436.64s)]
*  This is increasingly tough rhetoric from President Trump towards Vladimir Putin, but we know [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=438.20000000000005s)]
*  that every so often he does this. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=444.64s)]
*  He sort of gets angry at Putin but doesn't fall through with action. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=446.84s)]
*  However, there is a signal here that maybe this time that'll be different. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=450.71999999999997s)]
*  We heard from Senator Lindsey Graham late last night telling reporters on Capitol Hill [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=454.15999999999997s)]
*  that he believes President Trump is willing to support that tough round of sanctions that's [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=458.11999999999995s)]
*  been stalled in the Senate for a while because Trump previously didn't give his blessing. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=462.96s)]
*  Now, the White House didn't weigh in on this. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=467.79999999999995s)]
*  They simply pointed to Trump's comments. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=469.96s)]
*  So it seems like it's not official yet, but Graham optimistic that maybe as soon as next [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=471.76s)]
*  week these sanctions could be a go. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=477.76s)]
*  Well, you know, one thing that's happening is Putin is overplaying his hand right now. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=481.0s)]
*  Putin, by launching wave upon wave of attacks on civilian targets in Ukraine, what he's [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=487.15999999999997s)]
*  doing is essentially just thumbing his nose at Donald Trump. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=493.4s)]
*  He knows Trump wants to get some indication, some hope that there's some possibility of [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=496.68s)]
*  peace here, or at least a ceasefire. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=502.92s)]
*  And Putin keeps doubling down. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=504.92s)]
*  And it's starting to make Trump look bad. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=507.28000000000003s)]
*  It's starting to make Trump look weak. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=510.12s)]
*  And while Trump obviously has no real love for Ukraine, Trump has a lot of love for Trump. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=512.72s)]
*  And Trump doesn't want Vladimir Putin to make a fool of him on the world stage. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=519.4s)]
*  There might actually be right now a window of opportunity to get some additional aid [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=523.76s)]
*  to Ukraine, to get some additional sanctions on Russia. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=528.92s)]
*  And if there is that window of opportunity, I by all means seize it. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJhXqhblHaQ&t=531.76s)]
