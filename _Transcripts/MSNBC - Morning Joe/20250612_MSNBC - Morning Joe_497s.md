# Governors are fighting for criminals to stay: Republican slams sanctuary cities ahead of hearing
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew)
*  In that building at the top of the hour, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=0.0s)]
*  congressional Republicans are expected to grill [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=2.0s)]
*  three Democratic governors over their state's immigration policies. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=5.0s)]
*  Governors Tim Walz of Minnesota, J.B. Pritzker of Illinois, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=9.0s)]
*  and Kathy Hochul of New York have been called to testify [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=13.0s)]
*  before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=16.0s)]
*  Earlier this year, President Trump issued executive orders [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=20.0s)]
*  targeting so-called sanctuary cities, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=23.0s)]
*  and Republican Congressman James Comer of Kentucky, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=26.0s)]
*  who is the chair of the oversight panel, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=29.0s)]
*  has promised to explore the effects of state's sanctuary laws. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=31.0s)]
*  Joining us now, Republican Congressman Pete Sessions of Texas. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=36.0s)]
*  He is a member of the House Oversight Committee [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=40.0s)]
*  and will be taking part in that hearing. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=42.0s)]
*  Congressman, thank you for joining us this morning. We appreciate it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=45.0s)]
*  Let's start with this, the hearing coming a little later. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=48.0s)]
*  When President Trump took office and he said [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=52.0s)]
*  you wanted to close the borders, ramp up deportations, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=55.0s)]
*  he said it would focus on those who are here with criminal records, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=58.0s)]
*  ideally particularly violent criminal records. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=62.0s)]
*  We have seen though in recent weeks that effort has expanded [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=64.0s)]
*  to those whose only crime is being here, you know, without documentation. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=68.0s)]
*  So, and a lot of them live in sanctuary cities where that is prohibited. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=73.0s)]
*  So talk to us about how you feel about the shift in these tactics. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=77.0s)]
*  Well, the shift in policy, as it appears to be, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=82.0s)]
*  would be because local ICE agents who did their job where they were. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=86.0s)]
*  However, this nationwide task force is directly aimed at [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=91.0s)]
*  exactly what the President spoke about, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=96.0s)]
*  and that is criminals who are in our midst, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=99.0s)]
*  states that have allowed sanctuary policies to attract these criminals and others, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=102.0s)]
*  and then the correspondingly public policy that comes with it, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=108.0s)]
*  not only spending, but crime, drugs, and criminal activity, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=113.0s)]
*  including theft, burglary, and then sexual assault. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=119.0s)]
*  So the President has now gathered together, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=124.0s)]
*  and it took them a good bit of time to gather together the correct training, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=126.0s)]
*  the correct teams who would move across the country, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=131.0s)]
*  and the ramifications of how they would deal with local law enforcement. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=134.0s)]
*  And so they were really thrust into this as a result of a large number of people [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=139.0s)]
*  who have come to this country illegally committing heinous crimes [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=145.0s)]
*  that are in our midst every day. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=149.0s)]
*  That is what has focused the President now on coming into these communities. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=151.0s)]
*  And what's happened is these governors, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=157.0s)]
*  these cities are fighting for their criminals to stay where they are, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=159.0s)]
*  and we disagree with that. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=164.0s)]
*  So we're going to have a conversation today, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=166.0s)]
*  we'll be probably all day with these governors. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=169.0s)]
*  Now, to be clear, some of those who have been detained do not have violent criminal records. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=172.0s)]
*  I want to ask you one quick follow-up to this. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=175.0s)]
*  The governor of your state, Governor Abbott, deployed National Guard. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=177.0s)]
*  You're there in part because of protests in San Antonio and other cities. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=182.0s)]
*  But in California, Governor Newsom did not want the National Guard deployed. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=186.0s)]
*  President Trump did so anyway. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=191.0s)]
*  Are you comfortable with that response? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=193.0s)]
*  No, what I'm comfortable with is that the National Guard were mobilized. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=195.0s)]
*  They did not, in my opinion, become engaged in the activity. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=199.0s)]
*  They were there for civil reasons, to make sure that the buildings, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=204.0s)]
*  the people who they were around were not criminalized [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=210.0s)]
*  and perhaps for the civility of the city of Los Angeles. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=214.0s)]
*  I think they were properly utilized, and I'm proud of that. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=220.0s)]
*  Congressman, let's turn now to the piece of legislation, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=224.0s)]
*  the One Big Beautiful Bill, as has been dubbed by the president. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=227.0s)]
*  I know you voiced some misgivings about the impact on the debt and deficit, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=230.0s)]
*  but you did walk us through your thinking that got you to yes. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=235.0s)]
*  Well, the thinking that got me to yes is that the last moment, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=240.0s)]
*  there were two significant issues that were negotiated. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=244.0s)]
*  A couple hundred years ago, I lived in New Jersey. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=248.0s)]
*  I was at the old Bell Labs organization. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=252.0s)]
*  I think New Jersey is a great state, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=255.0s)]
*  but they're also one of these high-state tax states. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=257.0s)]
*  And the people who represent these cities and states were seeking the advantage [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=261.0s)]
*  to increase the amount of money that a person could deduct on their individual income tax [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=267.0s)]
*  that would be increased above $10,000, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=273.0s)]
*  as that became negotiated over the five or six weeks. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=277.0s)]
*  They landed on an answer that would get their vote. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=281.0s)]
*  And I will just tell you that I think that from my perspective, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=284.0s)]
*  while I was opposed to it, while I did not like it, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=289.0s)]
*  I believe that these votes that were necessary allowed us to pass the bill, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=292.0s)]
*  to get it to the Senate, to then to negotiate what might be seen as a different bill in some respects. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=299.0s)]
*  I think that the people who negotiated did so in fairness to the people who, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=306.0s)]
*  if their people do not receive this, they move out of their states. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=311.0s)]
*  They move somewhere else. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=315.0s)]
*  And I don't think that's in the best interest of people who live in these high-state areas, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=317.0s)]
*  nor people who would be receiving these people. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=322.0s)]
*  So we're trying to work together as a team. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=326.0s)]
*  I would hope that I have always been known as a person who's able to reach within [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=328.0s)]
*  at least my own party and give compromise to people who may offer a different view than I do. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=333.0s)]
*  The final vote is the one that I think that my party and I and the president will be held accountable for. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=339.0s)]
*  Congressman Sessions, it's Walter Isaacson. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=346.0s)]
*  And I have a question because you just talked about compromise on things. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=350.0s)]
*  There are certain extensions of the tax cuts that even Donald Trump thought were unnecessary [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=354.0s)]
*  and certainly may not be contributing to the growth of the economy. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=361.0s)]
*  If you try and reconcile in the bill with the Senate to get a balance where you actually bring down the deficit, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=365.0s)]
*  would some of those extensions of tax cuts be something you would consider to offset some of the other costs of the bill? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=373.0s)]
*  Walter, thank you very much. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=383.0s)]
*  You're savvy enough to remember that when President Obama back in 2009 took over, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=385.0s)]
*  they had 58 Democrats and got three more votes, and they raised what would be $6 trillion deficit, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=392.0s)]
*  just like we're talking about some two and a half or three right now. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=400.0s)]
*  President Obama found a way to increase taxes and increase spending significantly to get to $6 trillion. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=405.0s)]
*  We're trying to do the reverse. We're trying to keep our economy moving. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=413.0s)]
*  We're trying to make sure all sectors of the economy, including all parts of the country, including small business, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=418.0s)]
*  have these opportunities to not just compete around the world, but to compete in their communities. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=424.0s)]
*  And I think it's important that we remember that we are working off numbers back to the last time we had 60 votes in the Senate. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=431.0s)]
*  And that's what we're trying to match up to. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=440.0s)]
*  Ours is to reduce spending but increase marketplace, people that want to show up at jobs and people that have jobs. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=442.0s)]
*  And that is what this is about. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=451.0s)]
*  Walter, I will be very pleased to engage people on the issue that you spoke of, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=452.0s)]
*  because it is important that Republicans still get closer to that equal mark as opposed to the $6 trillion [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=458.0s)]
*  that Democrats and President Obama laid before the country in the past. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=466.0s)]
*  All right. Republican Congressman Pete Sessions of Texas. Congressman, thank you for joining us this morning. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=471.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02C3UNBHew&t=476.0s)]
