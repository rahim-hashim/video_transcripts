# Trump has 'betrayed' voters and the Constitution: House Dem vows to 'keep fighting' WH
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI)
*  It's kept one fiasco after another. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=0.0s)]
*  One minute Donald Trump and his people say one thing, then they say the opposite, then [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=4.0s)]
*  they say something else entirely. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  Nobody ever seems to know which way is up, and many of them just lie outright to the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=10.28s)]
*  American people. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=15.1s)]
*  It's corruption. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=17.12s)]
*  Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and Republicans are hijacking the government, raiding the public's [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=18.72s)]
*  piggy bank, and picking the pockets of the American people to enrich themselves. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=25.28s)]
*  Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and fellow senators held the floor open last night to criticize [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  President Trump's first 100 days in office, and today they'll join House Democrats on [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=36.72s)]
*  the steps of the Senate to continue pushing back against what they say is the administration's [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=42.52s)]
*  corruption, chaos, and the high cost of the GOP. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=48.040000000000006s)]
*  Joining us now, House Democratic Whip Congressman Katherine Clark of Massachusetts. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=53.16s)]
*  Thank you very much for being on the show this morning. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=58.08s)]
*  How would you characterize things? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=61.599999999999994s)]
*  What has changed for the country in President Trump's first 100 days? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=63.44s)]
*  Yeah, just about everything, Mika, and it is good to be with you, but here at this 100-day [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=69.16s)]
*  mark, I think that what you just heard sums it up. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=76.36s)]
*  This has been hallmarked by chaos and corruption, meant to keep us off balance and distracted [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=80.28s)]
*  from they are breaking our government in order to rob it and take money from programs like [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=86.88s)]
*  Medicaid, take our health care, our veterans' benefits, funding for public school, for child [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  care, and give it to the billionaire class in the form of tax cuts. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=100.6s)]
*  It is the same strategy, the same playbook, and we are seeing this play out in real time [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=106.16s)]
*  in such damaging ways to our economy, to our civil rights, and to our democracy. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=113.58s)]
*  Congresswoman, good morning. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=119.92s)]
*  Great to have you on the show. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=122.24s)]
*  We talk about Donald Trump a lot. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=124.25999999999999s)]
*  We recognize that many of his policies are very unpopular, as new polling has shown, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=125.97999999999999s)]
*  100 days, but in a Washington Post-ABC news poll, Donald Trump's approval rating was at [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=132.32s)]
*  37 percent, extraordinary low, about handling the country's main problems. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=138.48s)]
*  Democrats though, even farther down, at 30 percent, how do you explain that number, and [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=144.51999999999998s)]
*  what do Democrats need to do better? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=149.95999999999998s)]
*  Listen, this is where we are. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=153.35999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump made a promise that on day one of his presidency, he was going to reduce [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=156.88s)]
*  costs for Americans, whether that's groceries or housing or child care, transportation, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=162.94s)]
*  energy. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=169.56s)]
*  He has done just the opposite. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=170.56s)]
*  And what Democrats are doing is we are standing strong in saying, come back and focus on the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=172.88s)]
*  American people. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=180.48s)]
*  Put them in the center of the work you are doing. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=182.32s)]
*  Make sure that you are doing everything you can to fight for them. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=186.56s)]
*  And that's what we're doing. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=191.3s)]
*  We'll reach across the aisle when we can, but what we have been met with in the House [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=192.8s)]
*  GOP is absolute resistance. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=197.52s)]
*  They are loyal to one person, and that is Donald Trump. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=200.66s)]
*  And as we watch him and Elon Musk take a chainsaw to the services that American people deserve [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=204.7s)]
*  and pay for, all in order to enrich those who already have great wealth and power, this [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=212.2s)]
*  is where our work is centered. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=219.67999999999998s)]
*  And Democrats are going to keep fighting with everything that we have. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=222.23999999999998s)]
*  And when they're willing to work with us, we'll be ready to do that. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=227.32s)]
*  But that is not what we have seen from this GOP. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=231.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=234.04s)]
*  With all that said and understanding your opposition to Donald Trump and much of the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=235.04s)]
*  public's opposition, though, my question was, why do you believe Democrats are rating [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=238.76s)]
*  lower even than President Trump right now, if everything you just said is true? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=243.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=247.95999999999998s)]
*  Well, you know, we are going to continue our focus. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=248.95999999999998s)]
*  Listen, we lost an election. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=253.39999999999998s)]
*  We're very clear-eyed about that. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=255.76s)]
*  And we know that we have to show the American people that we are in it for them. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=258.09999999999997s)]
*  But that is where we are. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=264.02s)]
*  That is the roots of the Democratic Party. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=265.48s)]
*  And that is what we're going the work we're going to do every single day. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=268.20000000000005s)]
*  We are going to address the needs of our small businesses that are being crushed by these [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=272.34000000000003s)]
*  tariffs. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=278.16s)]
*  We are going to work to protect our public school funding. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=279.26s)]
*  You know, everything that this president promised that he ran on, that the American people said, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=283.16s)]
*  I may not totally be bought into this guy, but I think I'll bring change that is centered [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=289.52s)]
*  around me. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=295.71999999999997s)]
*  He has betrayed them. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=296.71999999999997s)]
*  He has betrayed them. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=299.44s)]
*  And he has betrayed our Constitution. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=301.24s)]
*  And he is ruining our economy in a short hundred days, even though it feels like a very long [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=304.09999999999997s)]
*  time in many ways. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=310.68s)]
*  He has taken an economy and tattered it and not focused on the issues that people needed [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=313.26s)]
*  him to focus. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=321.46s)]
*  How did they make their daily needs? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=322.98s)]
*  How did they get ahead and not just scrape by? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=325.58s)]
*  That's where Democrats are going to focus. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=329.18s)]
*  And I think that we are going to see, as we're already seeing in sort of that generic matchup [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=331.53999999999996s)]
*  between Democrats and Republicans in the House races. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=336.86s)]
*  We have a two, you know, a double digit lead in those. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=341.9s)]
*  So where about the work? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=347.29999999999995s)]
*  Where about making that connection with people at home and showing them that we are fighting [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=349.73999999999995s)]
*  on their side? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=354.29999999999995s)]
*  Democratic Whip, Congresswoman Catherine Clark of Massachusetts, thank you so much for coming [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=356.41999999999996s)]
*  on the show this morning. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=361.65999999999997s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_NGiqIe1LI&t=362.65999999999997s)]
