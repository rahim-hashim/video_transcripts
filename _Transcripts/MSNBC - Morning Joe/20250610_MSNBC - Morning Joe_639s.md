# 'An unbelievable, oversized reaction': Claire McCaskill rebukes Trump over National Guard order
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc)
*  Again out West where protests continued throughout downtown Los Angeles, this time less violent [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=0.0s)]
*  than what we saw over the weekend. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=6.8s)]
*  There were fewer clashes reported yesterday with law enforcement as groups marched across [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=9.08s)]
*  the city in protest of the Trump administration's immigration raids. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  Despite this, the White House deployed another 2,000 National Guard troops, bringing the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=19.88s)]
*  total number to 4,000 National Guard. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=25.98s)]
*  700 Marines were also activated. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=29.54s)]
*  California Governor Gavin Newsom says the deployment of the troops was unnecessary and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=33.3s)]
*  only stokes more fear and anger. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=37.82s)]
*  He's also calling the president's decision to mobilize the Marines illegal, saying he'll [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=41.14s)]
*  file a lawsuit against that move just like he did for the National Guard troops yesterday. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=46.78s)]
*  NBC News political and national correspondent Jacob Soboroff has the latest on that back and forth. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=53.7s)]
*  What do we want? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=60.14s)]
*  When do we want it? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=63.14s)]
*  Tensions high down the streets of Los Angeles and between the Trump administration and the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=66.14s)]
*  state of California. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=69.78s)]
*  The state announcing a lawsuit against the administration over its deployment of the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=71.34s)]
*  National Guard. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=75.26s)]
*  I like Gavin Newsom, he's a nice guy, but he's grossly incompetent. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=76.26s)]
*  Everybody knows. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=80.1s)]
*  While President Trump suggested he's open to arresting Governor Gavin Newsom. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=81.17999999999999s)]
*  I would do it if I was Tom. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=85.02s)]
*  Tom is Tom Homan, the president's border czar. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=88.02s)]
*  Over the weekend, Homan and Newsom throwing jabs at one another during interviews with [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=91.46s)]
*  NBC News. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=96.06s)]
*  Homan saying anyone who breaks the law by standing in the way of immigration enforcement [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=97.74s)]
*  could be arrested, even Newsom or L.A. Mayor Karen Bass. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=101.86s)]
*  Are they at risk of being arrested? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=106.02s)]
*  I'll say it about anybody. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=107.02s)]
*  You cross that line. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=108.46s)]
*  It's a felony to knowingly harbor a case of illegal alien. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=110.1s)]
*  It's a felony to impede law enforcement from doing their job. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=113.22s)]
*  That led to this reaction from Newsom, who I met up with at the Los Angeles County Emergency [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=116.25999999999999s)]
*  Operations Center. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=120.33999999999999s)]
*  Tom Homan, the border czar, said to me yesterday, he did not rule out literally arresting you, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=122.14s)]
*  nor Mayor Bass, if you interfere in his words. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=127.74s)]
*  He said you hadn't yet. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=130.42s)]
*  He's a tough guy. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=131.42s)]
*  Why doesn't he do that? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=132.42s)]
*  He knows where to find me. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=133.42s)]
*  So Tom, arrest me. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=134.42s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=135.85999999999999s)]
*  Homan clarifying his comments. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=136.85999999999999s)]
*  They have a cross line, but they're not above the law either. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=138.74s)]
*  If they commit a crime, they certainly ask for prosecution. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=142.34s)]
*  That's what was happening. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=145.46s)]
*  I never threatened or rescued their Newsom. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=146.46s)]
*  The protests ignited after a series of immigration raids in L.A., where as many as a million [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=148.98000000000002s)]
*  undocumented immigrants live. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=153.54000000000002s)]
*  Before those protests on Friday, one of the locations where ICE reportedly conducted an [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=155.52s)]
*  enforcement operation was right here in this parking lot of a Home Depot in the Cypress [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=158.98000000000002s)]
*  Park neighborhood of Los Angeles, where day laborers stand on corners just like this and [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=162.76000000000002s)]
*  wait for cars to go by in order to be offered a job and go take one for the day. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=167.1s)]
*  In the face of the uncommon raids, these undocumented workers felt it was important to speak out, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=171.84s)]
*  but wore masks to protect their identities. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=176.9s)]
*  Are you worried about about your family, about your families? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=180.1s)]
*  Organizer Pablo Alvarado calling the raids the highest expression of hypocrisy. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=186.14s)]
*  We need your labor, but we don't want to accept your humanity. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=191.18s)]
*  We need your labor, but we don't want to respect your rights. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=194.9s)]
*  And there's one of the issues right there. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=199.26000000000002s)]
*  Eugene Robinson, I'll start with you. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=201.06s)]
*  Obviously, there are these two guys talking about arresting one another, potentially Gavin [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=203.62s)]
*  Newsom. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=208.82s)]
*  But until something like that happens, there are these ICE raids underway, and there is [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=209.82s)]
*  a terrified community. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=215.66s)]
*  And then the implications of that, how do you see this playing out? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=218.1s)]
*  Well, first of all, Tom Homan, let's be clear, doesn't have any authority to arrest anybody, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=221.85999999999999s)]
*  let alone Gavin Newsom. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=228.14s)]
*  He's a White House adviser. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=229.14s)]
*  He has no law enforcement position or anything, so he can't arrest Gavin Newsom even if he [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=231.14s)]
*  wanted to. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=240.54s)]
*  So how does this play out? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=241.9s)]
*  I mean, what is actually happening? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=243.22s)]
*  Donald Trump clearly is changing the subject. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=246.57999999999998s)]
*  He loves talking about immigration. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=252.22s)]
*  He loves creating this image of chaos in the streets that only he can solve, that only [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=254.5s)]
*  he can quiet. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=263.78000000000003s)]
*  And it gets everybody talking about this, and rightly so. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=265.94s)]
*  There were disturbances over the weekend, and it's a real issue. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=271.46000000000004s)]
*  These ICE raids are being done in an unprecedented manner in contravention of the way they usually [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=275.22s)]
*  do immigration enforcement. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=283.46000000000004s)]
*  But it gets us talking about this rather than talking about the big, beautiful bill that [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=285.82000000000005s)]
*  nobody likes, the big, beautiful bill that a majority of the American people don't want [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=291.26000000000005s)]
*  because of the cuts to Medicaid, because of the tax cuts for billionaires and billionaires, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=296.78000000000003s)]
*  because of what it does to the national debt. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=303.02s)]
*  And so, you know, he's very good at changing the subject, and he's done it again. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=306.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=312.21999999999997s)]
*  To that point, President Trump called in the National Guard to L.A., despite Governor Newsom [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=313.21999999999997s)]
*  not requesting it. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=319.74s)]
*  Compare that to what he said back in 2020. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=321.62s)]
*  We have laws. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=326.26s)]
*  We have to go by the laws. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=327.26s)]
*  We can't move in the National Guard. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=328.78s)]
*  I can call insurrection, but there's no reason to ever do that, even in a Portland case. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=330.66s)]
*  We can't call in the National Guard unless we're requested by a governor. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=335.3s)]
*  So Claire McCaskill, what changed here? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=340.78000000000003s)]
*  Oh, nothing. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=343.06s)]
*  He just, he wanted to put on the show. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=344.54s)]
*  This is really just a reality TV show that he's trying to produce here. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=347.14000000000004s)]
*  You know, what's really unbelievable about this is we need some more context here, Mika. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=352.78000000000003s)]
*  If you look at what happened after the Lakers won the NBA championship, I wish we had overhead [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=357.68s)]
*  shots of the crowds when the Lakers won the NBA championship and the protests that occurred [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=364.68s)]
*  over the weekend. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=370.96000000000004s)]
*  The NBA championship folks in the streets dwarfed the number of people who have been [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=372.76s)]
*  out protesting in L.A. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=378.32s)]
*  If you look at the pictures from last night, there were two times as many law enforcement [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=380.08s)]
*  on the street as there were protesters. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=384.76s)]
*  This is so out of proportion to what happened. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=387.48s)]
*  There were three times as many people arrested the night the NBA won, the Lakers won the [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=391.06s)]
*  NBA championship as we're arrested on the night we first had some incidents of violence [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=396.24s)]
*  in L.A. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=401.8s)]
*  And who are the very best people trained to deal with crowd control and de-escalation? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=403.32s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=409.6s)]
*  It's the police departments in places like Los Angeles. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=410.68s)]
*  The Marines, I mean, as General Hurtling said, they don't know how to do crowd control. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=414.76000000000005s)]
*  We're not trained in that. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=419.88000000000005s)]
*  This is such an unbelievable oversized reaction to people who passionately felt they had the [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=421.88000000000005s)]
*  right to protest in America. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=430.5s)]
*  And last time I looked, it was a pretty all-American value to peacefully protest. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=432.04s)]
*  I just beg, I've said this before on the network, but I want to say it again. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=436.28000000000003s)]
*  I beg everyone who feels passionately about this to not be violent. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=440.72s)]
*  It's giving Donald Trump the opportunity and it's creating the role that has run over [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=444.52s)]
*  and over again and gives everyone the impression this problem is much bigger than it is. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=449.79999999999995s)]
*  And Jonathan, Mayor Bass herself said, yes, there are people committing crimes. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=454.44s)]
*  They will be identified and arrested as they should be. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=458.84s)]
*  But the LAPD has this. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=461.79999999999995s)]
*  The LAPD has handled much bigger protests, much more violence, in fact. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=464.0s)]

*  else that they can deploy. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=472.84s)]
*  And if that's the case that Mayor Bass and Governor Newsom are making, yes, this is something [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=473.84s)]
*  that has to be dealt with and we are dealing with it. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=479.32s)]
*  We don't need the National Guard, let alone the United States Marine Corps. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=481.52s)]
*  The mayor, the governor, the police commissioner have all said that. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=485.23999999999995s)]
*  We've got this under control. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=488.56s)]
*  The number of people who are being violent, it's a very small minority of these protesters. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=490.2s)]
*  The vast majority have done it peacefully. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=494.88s)]
*  Those that have been violent, of course, they shouldn't do that. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=497.03999999999996s)]
*  We will find them. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=499.23999999999995s)]
*  We will arrest them. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=500.23999999999995s)]
*  We will prosecute them. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=501.44s)]
*  This is an opportunity for this White House. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=502.48s)]
*  I heard from a White House adviser just this morning, basically saying, we couldn't have [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=504.4s)]
*  scripted this any better. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=507.4s)]
*  Looking to change the topic of conversation from the Elon Musk brouhaha last week and [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=509.0s)]
*  the ongoing questions about the bill, the big beautiful bill, quote, quote, that's heading [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=513.96s)]
*  to the Senate. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=517.92s)]
*  Mike, this is the turf where they want to fight. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=518.92s)]
*  And it's California, it's Los Angeles, a deep blue state and city. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=522.08s)]
*  They're getting those images in that B-roll that Claire just talked about of a masked [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=526.34s)]
*  man with a Mexican flag in front of a car that's on fire, one of those self-driving [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=530.24s)]
*  taxis probably. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=534.4s)]
*  And that's what they want to project to their audiences, to their base. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=536.2s)]
*  Look, this is dangerous. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=540.0s)]
*  That's why we're taking the steps that we are. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=542.32s)]
*  And they're setting a trap for Democrats. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=544.5600000000001s)]
*  Well, the text reply that you got this morning from whoever you were texting with in terms [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=546.24s)]
*  of this administration, they're correct. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=551.5600000000001s)]
*  They couldn't have dreamed that it would go this way. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=554.88s)]
*  Look, there are 2,000 members of the National Guard on the streets of Los Angeles this [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=557.52s)]
*  morning. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=561.4399999999999s)]
*  There are 700 Marines, combat-trained Marines, en route to Los Angeles to stand and guard [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=562.4399999999999s)]
*  a building, OK? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=568.16s)]
*  So that's 2,700 total United States military personnel on the streets of Los Angeles. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=569.68s)]
*  There are 9,000 members of the Los Angeles Police Department. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=574.84s)]
*  I've heard Mayor Bass, I've heard Governor, I've heard the governor, Governor Newsom, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=579.16s)]
*  talking about this, what's going on for the past couple of days. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=583.0799999999999s)]
*  I haven't heard either of them say, you cannot throw cement blocks at police cars. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=585.5999999999999s)]
*  You cannot light the American flag on fire. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=592.4799999999999s)]
*  You cannot damage buildings. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=595.76s)]
*  You cannot damage property. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=597.76s)]
*  You cannot riot on the streets of Los Angeles. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=599.8s)]
*  Or you, whoever you are, are going to be subject to those three magic words that only the police [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=602.4399999999999s)]
*  department can use. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=608.0799999999999s)]
*  You're under arrest. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=609.8s)]
*  Until that happens, until they deal forcefully with what is actually going on in the ground, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=611.54s)]
*  the Democrats are taking a huge loss on this. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfSPsX0Rc&t=616.4599999999999s)]
