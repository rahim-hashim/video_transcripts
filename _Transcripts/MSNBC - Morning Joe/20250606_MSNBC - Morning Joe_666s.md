*  and Elon Musk, the president threatening to cut [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=51.8s)]
*  Elon Musk's government contracts. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=53.96s)]
*  Over the past few days, Musk has been ramping up [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=56.32s)]
*  his criticism of the president's domestic policy [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=58.76s)]
*  bill, calling on lawmakers to kill the legislation, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=61.4s)]

*  which it will. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=66.92s)]
*  President Trump addressed those comments yesterday, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=67.84s)]
*  saying Musk is just upset about the cuts [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=70.12s)]
*  to electric vehicle mandates. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=72.92s)]
*  I've always liked Elon, and I was always very surprised. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=75.88s)]
*  You saw the words he had for me, the words of... [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=78.68s)]
*  And he hasn't said anything about me that's bad. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=81.36s)]
*  I'd rather have him criticize me than the bill, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=83.92s)]
*  because the bill is incredible. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=85.96s)]
*  He knew every aspect of this bill. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=88.4s)]
*  He knew it better than almost anybody, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=90.16s)]
*  and he never had a problem until right after he left. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=92.52s)]
*  Musk reacted to the president's remarks [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=97.12s)]
*  in a slew of social media posts, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=99.24s)]
*  defending his stance on the domestic spending bill [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=101.24s)]
*  and going much, much further. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=103.72s)]
*  He also replied to a clip of President Trump [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  claiming he would have, quote, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=108.12s)]
*  won Pennsylvania regardless of Elon, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=109.68s)]
*  writing, quote, without me, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=112.2s)]
*  Trump would have lost the election. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=113.72s)]
*  Such ingratitude, wrote Musk of the president. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=116.0s)]
*  Shortly after, President Trump pushed back [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=119.08s)]
*  on his own social media site, Truth Social, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  posting, Elon was wearing thin. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=124.19999999999999s)]
*  I asked him to leave. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=126.6s)]
*  I took away his EV mandate [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=127.72s)]
*  that forced everyone to buy electric cars. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=129.44s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=131.64s)]
*  That nobody else wanted, and he just went crazy. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=132.68s)]
*  There are electric vehicle tax credits. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=135.07999999999998s)]
*  Then the president suggested [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=136.95999999999998s)]
*  terminating Musk's governmental subsidies [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=138.35999999999999s)]
*  to save money in the federal budget, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=140.88s)]
*  to which Musk wrote, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=143.08s)]
*  SpaceX will begin decommissioning [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  its Dragon spacecraft immediately. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=147.04000000000002s)]
*  Musk also ramped up his attacks on the president, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=149.56s)]
*  claiming without evidence that Trump is mentioned [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=152.76000000000002s)]
*  in the Jeffrey Epstein files. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=155.64000000000001s)]
*  Epstein, of course, a multimillionaire accused [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=157.88000000000002s)]
*  of sex trafficking young girls, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=160.24s)]
*  but died by suicide in a Manhattan jail [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=162.68s)]
*  before his trial started. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=165.56s)]
*  Trump has denied any involvement [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=167.20000000000002s)]
*  in Epstein's criminal activities. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=169.12s)]
*  The feud between Musk and Trump [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=171.04s)]
*  did simmer a bit later in the day [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=173.16s)]
*  when the president posted this. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=175.44s)]
*  I don't mind Elon turning against me, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=177.12s)]
*  but he should have done so months ago. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=179.72s)]
*  This is one of the greatest bills [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=182.16s)]
*  ever presented to Congress. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=183.95999999999998s)]
*  Sam Stein, I'll just start with you [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=186.92s)]
*  and open the floor about what we all watched yesterday. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=188.64s)]
*  As John and I were discussing, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=193.0s)]
*  this was enough to actually get people [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=194.39999999999998s)]
*  to put X back on their phones for the first time [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=196.32s)]
*  and it took us a long time to watch this back and forth. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=199.51999999999998s)]
*  What did you make of what you saw? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=202.48s)]
*  What do you think the implications are [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  for the so-called big, beautiful bill? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=205.56s)]
*  So yes, it was riveting and delicious, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=208.12s)]
*  but also then you step back and you realize [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=212.76s)]
*  these are kind of emotionally unstable men [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=214.95999999999998s)]
*  who are the power brokers of the universe, right? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=217.32s)]
*  It's like the president and the richest man in the world [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=219.79999999999998s)]
*  just throwing absolute haymakers at each other [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=223.2s)]
*  in deeply personal terms, accusations of pedophilia, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=226.56s)]
*  canceling government contracts [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=230.8s)]
*  that would be critical to our space system, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=232.4s)]
*  implicating tax revenues [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=236.08s)]
*  and the signature piece of domestic legislation [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=237.8s)]
*  for the country. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=241.48s)]
*  I mean, it's like, what are we actually doing here? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=242.32s)]
*  Maybe they need to take it offline, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=244.16s)]
*  but then we wouldn't have all the entertainment. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=246.16s)]
*  I'm left wondering how this kind of gets put back together [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=249.32s)]
*  and maybe it does, maybe it doesn't. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=253.2s)]
*  Obviously, you referenced what appeared to be a detente, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=254.8s)]
*  but once you accuse someone of being [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=258.8s)]
*  on the Jeffrey Epstein list, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=261.52000000000004s)]
*  it's hard to take that back and, Gene, I don't know, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=263.32s)]
*  like where do we go from here? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=266.92s)]
*  Two extremely egotistical men [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=269.44s)]
*  with also extremely fragile egos. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=272.32s)]
*  Maybe they can find a way to patch things up [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=275.12s)]
*  and I could see it, but how does that happen? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=277.56s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=280.6s)]
*  The world's most powerful man and the world's richest man, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=282.08000000000004s)]
*  they're both big babies with huge egos. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=284.84s)]
*  What could possibly go wrong? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=287.0s)]
*  Well, we saw yesterday what could go wrong. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=288.36s)]
*  Look, I think it probably cools down. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=290.56s)]
*  I don't think they're ever BFFs again, right? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=295.68s)]
*  They're not, the bromance is over clearly [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=298.71999999999997s)]
*  after the things they said yesterday, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=301.08s)]
*  so they're not gonna be hugging [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=302.64s)]
*  and I don't think Trump is gonna be driving his Tesla, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=304.52s)]
*  although I don't think he drives anything. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=307.96s)]
*  He might be keying the Tesla. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=310.6s)]
*  Exactly, might be keying the Tesla, right, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=311.92s)]
*  or torching it, but they both have a lot at stake here. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=314.6s)]
*  They both have a lot to lose. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=321.2s)]
*  Who has more at stake? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=322.40000000000003s)]
*  Who has more? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=323.56s)]
*  Musk, Musk has more at stake, absolutely, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=324.40000000000003s)]
*  because he's, the president's the most powerful man [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=327.04s)]
*  in the world, so Musk is like, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=329.48s)]
*  I'm gonna shut down SpaceX's dragon [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=330.92s)]
*  and you won't be able to get to the space ship. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=334.16s)]
*  I think the president can nationalize SpaceX [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=336.88s)]
*  if he doesn't call an emergency and say, okay. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=340.64s)]
*  So the president has a lot of cards to play [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=344.76s)]
*  in any situation, so I think, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=349.36s)]
*  plus all of Musk's contracts, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=353.16s)]
*  his net worth went down like $34 billion yesterday, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=355.48s)]
*  which even for a man that rich is not a pleasant thing. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=359.68s)]
*  So, but we'll see, we'll see. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=363.92s)]
*  I mean, he is pretty crazy. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=367.36s)]
*  So Carlos, beyond the grab your popcorn element [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=369.59999999999997s)]
*  of watching this play out yesterday, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=372.59999999999997s)]
*  there are the practical questions about what it means [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=374.28s)]
*  for this massive bill. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=376.56s)]
*  So what do you think about what your former colleagues, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=379.03999999999996s)]
*  the Republican colleagues who've always fallen in line [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=381.76s)]
*  with Donald Trump do with what they just saw yesterday? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=384.68s)]
*  It seems to be the consensus in listening [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=388.12s)]
*  to Speaker Johnson respond to Elon Musk yesterday [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=389.88s)]
*  that they will fall in line with President Trump [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=392.88s)]
*  and not side with their benefactor, Elon Musk, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=395.08000000000004s)]
*  who helped many of them get elected or reelected. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=399.44s)]
*  So what's your sense of how this impacts [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=401.68s)]
*  this massive piece of legislation Republicans [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=404.28000000000003s)]
*  are trying to push through? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=406.68s)]
*  Well, that's right, Willie. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=408.68s)]
*  Look, Elon Musk was a big part of the coalition [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=409.6s)]
*  that Donald Trump put in place in 2024, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=412.88s)]
*  an impressive coalition, right? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=416.24s)]
*  For him, especially a lot of people didn't think [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=417.76s)]
*  he could get the popular vote and he did. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=419.72s)]
*  And that was in large part, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=422.12s)]
*  thanks to Elon Musk's support. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=423.72s)]
*  And by the way, there's also this cultural phenomena [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=425.56s)]
*  associated with Elon Musk, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=428.2s)]
*  which was also part of the Trump movement. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=429.52s)]
*  Now that is fractured. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=431.48s)]
*  And I can tell you that congressional Republicans [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=433.24s)]
*  are getting anxious about this. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=435.72s)]
*  Elon Musk has a lot of money. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=437.36s)]
*  He spent nearly $300 million to help Trump get elected. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=439.48s)]
*  For a lot less, he could be influential [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=443.2s)]
*  when it comes to congressional elections. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=446.16s)]
*  And some of these Republicans are wondering, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=448.48s)]
*  is Elon actually going to come and spend money against me [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=450.64000000000004s)]
*  if I vote for this bill? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=454.36s)]
*  And a million dollars in a tough congressional district [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=456.40000000000003s)]
*  goes a very long way. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=459.40000000000003s)]
*  So this is gonna complicate the path for this bill. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=461.12s)]
*  Do I think they get it done eventually? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=463.96000000000004s)]
*  Yes, but this is gonna make it a little harder. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=465.68s)]
*  I guess I'm curious because what he wants changed [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=468.08000000000004s)]
*  in this bill is basically what? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=471.36s)]
*  The EV tax credits to be restored. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=473.52000000000004s)]
*  We don't really actually know. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=475.40000000000003s)]
*  He keeps talking about deficit and debt. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=476.6s)]
*  That would just be about the extension of the Trump tax cuts. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=478.92s)]
*  So do you see substantive changes [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=481.71999999999997s)]
*  at the behest of Elon Musk or is this just, you know? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=483.44s)]
*  I mean, what is the end game for you here? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=486.44s)]
*  Well, look, Elon Musk's public positioning [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=487.52s)]
*  is that what he cares about is government spending. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=490.52s)]
*  And by the way, I mean, he does have a record [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=493.6s)]
*  to kind of back that up. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=495.52s)]
*  This is part of the tension in the Trump coalition, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=496.68s)]
*  the MAGA movement, which really doesn't care [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=499.76s)]
*  about government spending, about reforming entitlements, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=502.15999999999997s)]
*  and then classic conservatives. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=504.56s)]
*  And I think Musk is more of a classic conservative [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=506.0s)]
*  who wants to see the size of government reduced. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=509.4s)]
*  So that tension's there. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=511.84s)]
*  If they make those kinds of changes to the bill, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=513.96s)]
*  I guess Musk will have to swallow it. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=516.28s)]
*  The White House is alleging that this is all [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=518.08s)]
*  about the EV tax credit, but some people will tell you, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=520.16s)]
*  you know, Musk doesn't really care for the EV tax credit [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=523.04s)]
*  because if it goes away, it's actually a barrier [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=526.04s)]
*  to entry for competitors. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=527.96s)]
*  Right, for competitors. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=529.8s)]
*  But you know, the interesting thing though is, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=530.64s)]
*  so I think populist MAGA clearly goes with Trump [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=532.72s)]
*  and I think the Republican base basically goes with Trump, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=537.4s)]
*  but there's the tech Republican base, right? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=541.6s)]
*  All these tech bazillionaires who piled [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=545.0799999999999s)]
*  into the MAGA coalition, but never were really of it. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=550.04s)]
*  I mean, they didn't really agree with a lot [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=555.0799999999999s)]
*  of what Trump was saying and doing. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=558.04s)]
*  And a lot of those people have a lot of personal [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=561.1999999999999s)]
*  and business interests to stay on the good side of Elon Musk. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=565.52s)]
*  So that could be kind of a split in MAGA. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=569.52s)]
*  You could see the tech side kind of going with Musk. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=573.6s)]
*  And it's a new coalition. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=576.08s)]
*  Lemire, I'm kind of curious for you taking this [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=577.6s)]
*  because you've covered Trump more than anyone else here. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=579.16s)]
*  He doesn't really like forgiveness. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=582.52s)]
*  I think once you get on his bad side, you're on his bad side. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=584.84s)]
*  But in this case, Elon is worth a fair chunk of money. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=588.36s)]
*  He did help. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=591.52s)]
*  He has promised a hundred million dollar check, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=592.48s)]
*  which has not been written, we should note. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=594.48s)]
*  What do you predict Trump will do? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=596.52s)]
*  Will he take him back? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=598.48s)]
*  Is he gonna make him growl a little bit? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=599.76s)]
*  I mean, how does this work for Trump? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=601.32s)]
*  You're right, the Trump not really [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=603.16s)]
*  in the forgiveness business. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=604.52s)]
*  And the most grievous insult that Musk hurled yesterday [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=605.72s)]
*  was not about Jeffrey Epstein, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=608.6s)]
*  but rather Musk taking credit for Trump's win. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=610.04s)]
*  That is where I think that people around the president [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=612.8000000000001s)]
*  said yesterday that may be a bridge too far. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=615.2s)]
*  Will, there was a report last night [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=620.08s)]
*  that Musk and Trump were gonna speak today. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=621.76s)]
*  Actually, NBC News just a few moments ago says, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=624.0s)]
*  White House says that's not the case. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=626.8000000000001s)]
*  There are no plans for a call between Musk and Trump today. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=628.24s)]
*  So we will see. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=633.0s)]
*  There was an effort. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=633.84s)]
*  Musk late last night was tweeting a little bit, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=634.6800000000001s)]
*  response to tweets, Bill Altman, others, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=636.6s)]
*  suggesting he did want to deescalate this. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=638.76s)]
*  He said that he wouldn't decommission [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=641.1600000000001s)]
*  the Space Dragon program. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=643.36s)]
*  We'll see, but Ali, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnmE-NKBsU&t=645.08s)]
