*  they're doing it from a very conservative. Mr. President please don't [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=18.0s)]
*  threaten the Fed chair you're gonna cause a market route please don't be [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=23.12s)]
*  careful about the bond market but you know nobody can say that during these [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=29.02s)]
*  times that the Wall Street Journal editorial page tried to do the old [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=34.74s)]
*  Homer Simpson and hide in the bush. Every day in every way. Here's part of what they're writing the Wall Street Journal writing the fire [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=39.06s)]
*  Jerome Powell market route it reads if the White House wanted a test of how [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=47.94s)]
*  firing Jerome Powell would go over in the markets it succeeded on Monday US [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=52.18s)]
*  stocks and the dollar plunge while yields on long-term treasuries climbed [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=56.46s)]
*  after President Trump renewed his attacks on the Federal Reserve Chairman. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=60.18s)]
*  Markets now they know the tariffs are taxes and taxes are anti-growth. The [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=63.980000000000004s)]
*  Trump tariffs are the biggest economic policy mistake in decades and extending [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=69.14s)]
*  the 2017 tax reform and deregulation may not compensate for all the damage. Smart [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=72.98s)]
*  presidents pay attention to market signals and adapt writes the journal. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=78.66s)]
*  The adaptation now would be to negotiate a quick end to the tariff barrage claim [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=82.7s)]
*  some trade deal victories and call it a day but markets are spooked because they [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=88.06s)]
*  don't know if Mr. Trump listens to anyone but his own impulses. It's a good time to [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=92.36s)]
*  bring in CNBC senior markets correspondent Dom Chu. Dom good to see [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=97.0s)]
*  you this morning also from the journal on the news side this headline this [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=101.48s)]
*  morning Dow headed for worst April since the Great Depression. What is this [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=104.5s)]
*  all about? So basically what we have is a situation where over the course of the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=109.86s)]
*  last several weeks there's been a an evolving narrative if you will right we [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=115.38s)]
*  talked about this notion that with new policies especially on the tariff front [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=119.86s)]
*  what you have is a new degree of uncertainty brought to global markets [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=125.34s)]
*  global trade that then manifests itself in the way that markets have reacted [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=129.9s)]
*  with some of that downside volatility. Now I remember over the course of the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=134.42000000000002s)]
*  last few weeks having this conversation kind of around the lead up to that so [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=137.73999999999998s)]
*  called Liberation Day and the tariff announcement about the stabilization [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=143.01999999999998s)]
*  factor of the US market in the US economy. Over the course of the last [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=147.38s)]
*  several decades the American economy and the markets the capital markets have [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=151.22s)]
*  been seen as a stabilizing force within the global economy and the global market [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=155.7s)]
*  one that you can turn to no matter what in good times and in bad. That [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=160.33999999999997s)]
*  narrative has shifted a little bit more it started off a little bit more along [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=164.94s)]
*  the lines of can you still trust the US dollar now the US dollar is the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=168.94s)]
*  preeminent and the world's really only reserve currency out there it's the one [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=173.57999999999998s)]
*  that you go to because pretty much every asset out there worth having is [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=177.46s)]
*  denominated in US dollars. The US Treasury market is the deepest most [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=180.9s)]
*  liquid sovereign bond market in the world it is the safest place to be. In [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=186.02s)]
*  the course of the last few weeks there's been a little bit of chatter early on [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=190.66s)]
*  about the luster coming off some of those assets the US dollar and the US [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=194.66s)]
*  Treasury side of things. Over the course of the last couple of weeks there is now [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=199.29999999999998s)]
*  a full-blown debate in certain parts of Wall Street about whether or not there [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=203.94s)]
*  is a market shine coming off the value of the US dollar and the US Treasury [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=208.06s)]
*  market. In no way is anybody out there saying that the US dollar is still not a [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=213.34s)]
*  reserve currency. There is in no way anybody saying that the US Treasury [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=218.78s)]
*  market is not the place that you want to be but when you have a possible [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=223.22s)]
*  paradigm shift a change in thinking about the way that the dollar is valued [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=227.3s)]
*  and viewed in the global market the way that our sovereign bonds the US Treasury [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=232.38s)]
*  market is viewed in the market that that shift or potential shift is enough to [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=237.14s)]
*  have traders and investors not just here in America but around the world [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=243.26s)]
*  questioning whether or not you have to change the way that you think about it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=247.46s)]
*  Now to be fair Treasury Secretary Scott Besson's like every other Treasury [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=251.38s)]
*  Secretary before him has proclaimed the notion of a strong US dollar and of [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=255.86s)]
*  course the idea that the US capital markets are the deepest most liquid in [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=261.54s)]
*  the world. The question now becomes guys whether or not that incremental effect [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=265.1s)]
*  of not just the tariff and trade policy but now the attacks on the central bank [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=269.9s)]
*  and its independence and its leader are making those assets again relatively [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=274.5s)]
*  less attractive. They are still the most attractive out there but in a term of [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=280.38s)]
*  relative less luster could that change the way that people think about the way [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=284.38s)]
*  that US markets operate that's what you're kind of seeing play out right now. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=289.02s)]
*  Alright CNBC's Dom Chu thank you so much greatly appreciate it and I love how Dom [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=292.46s)]
*  pointed out that we're still obviously still where the people have gone [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=298.02s)]
*  will continue to go most likely and all of this depends on what Donald Trump [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=307.14000000000004s)]
*  decides he wants to do I think that's what's rattling the markets is that it's [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=316.1s)]
*  one person who's deciding how far he takes takes this. But the United States [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=319.66s)]
*  does remain this this massive economic power and this is while this has been the [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=327.34000000000003s)]
*  worst April since the Great Depression one wonders if he starts striking deals [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=334.1s)]
*  with the UK with Europe with Japan with South Korea and and stops talking about [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=339.94s)]
*  Jerome Powell one wonders if that market doesn't go back up. It certainly may and [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=350.90000000000003s)]
*  investors seem like have built in that expectation but it hasn't happened yet [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=355.86s)]
*  and let's be clear we're now three yesterday was because of Powell. Powell [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=359.62s)]
*  down to almost a thousand points. The Powell talk is it rattled the markets and the trade [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=364.34000000000003s)]
*  deals we're now three weeks since liberation day three weeks tomorrow [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=370.54s)]
*  since so-called liberation day nothing's done there has been some preliminary [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=373.18s)]
*  talks I'm told furthest along with Japan there have been some others [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=376.74s)]
*  negotiations that have begun as well but nothing's done and in fact even some [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=381.1s)]
*  very Trump friendly economists Charles Gasparino who we know the White House [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=384.9s)]
*  listens to is on Fox News last night was talking about how he believes there's [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=388.86s)]
*  been real snags in the deal with Japan and that nothing is close that best [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=392.65999999999997s)]
*  sent over promised the speed at which these things would get done so therefore [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=396.54s)]
*  if indeed this does drag on for days and weeks longer which it seems likely then [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=400.82s)]
*  it becomes a question of Trump's pain threshold is he going to push another [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=406.14s)]
*  pause perhaps to buy more time maybe boost the markets right now they're [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=410.1s)]
*  rattled. You know again it's a lot like what I said about Doge early on [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=414.53999999999996s)]
*  transparency would have been the better route to say this is what we're doing [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=418.98s)]
*  today this will today we're going to be looking at USAID these are the programs [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=423.22s)]
*  we're concerned about and do it that way don't sneak up on people it's the same [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=428.46s)]
*  thing with the tariffs and the negotiations I mean I I'm pretty [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=433.42s)]
*  confident I let me just say maybe kinda that you know they want a deal [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=439.02s)]
*  they want to move toward a deal but if they've hit a snag it would be good say [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=448.5s)]
*  these are what we're negotiating just like they do with arms deals we've had [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=452.66s)]
*  an issue on this problem or that problem we're talking Japan we're gonna work [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=458.34s)]
*  through it but it would that transparency would be very good for the [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=462.38s)]
*  markets. This is where that Silicon Valley Elon Musk move fast and break [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=465.78s)]
*  stuff thing catches up to work and by the way look at the federal government [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=469.78s)]
*  look where Elon Musk he tried to look where he is today it doesn't work right it [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=473.46s)]
*  doesn't work talking to some people too in Washington they believe now the [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=478.21999999999997s)]
*  president is trying to set up Jerome Powell as the villain right because he [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=482.02s)]
*  sees what's happening the economy he understands perhaps that he's made a [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=486.78s)]
*  mistake with these tariffs he's watching the markets tank worst April since the [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=489.65999999999997s)]
*  Great Depression he doesn't want that on him so now he's trying in some way to [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=493.21999999999997s)]
*  say he won't cut rates it's his fault if he would just go along with me the [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=497.02s)]
*  economy would be fine which is not true. And speaking of Musk we should note [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=501.58s)]
*  today is a Tesla earnings call today some people believe that Musk in that [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=504.65999999999997s)]
*  call might reveal how much longer he's gonna stay working for the administration. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=508.18s)]
*  And how well the company is doing? I mean again their problem is part of the [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=511.06s)]
*  problem Jonathan is a political problem obviously he the very areas where he [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=516.26s)]
*  used to get the most you know whether you look at California or let's just say [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=523.6999999999999s)]
*  bluer states where he'd find most of his EV customers those cells are drying [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=528.26s)]
*  up you look at France you look at Germany you look at his EV sales in [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=535.7s)]
*  Europe getting absolutely pounded because again he got involved unnecessarily in [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=540.98s)]
*  far-right politics to little to no effect in fact God you look have you [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=545.3s)]

*  working all he's doing is damaging his brand and then China I mean if this [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=560.26s)]
*  were just politics that would be one problem with with Tessa the problem is [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=566.14s)]
*  he's getting lapped in China on technology the very thing again I'm not [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1z0DFEfACw&t=570.3199999999999s)]
