# 'Purely political': Why Trump's 50 percent tariff on Brazil raises concerns
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4)
*  President Trump sent letters to more countries yesterday threatening higher tariffs if they [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=0.0s)]
*  don't reach a trade deal with the U.S. by August 1st. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=5.8s)]
*  Of the eight countries who received letters, only Brazil is a major American trading partner, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=10.36s)]
*  ranking 10th overall. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=16.8s)]
*  It faces a possible tariff of 50 percent next month. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=18.92s)]
*  The higher taxes are because of the trial for its former president, Jair Bolsonaro. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=24.0s)]
*  He is a Trump ally who is accused of trying to overturn his 2022 election loss. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=31.32s)]
*  In the letter announcing Brazil's tariff, President Trump called Bolsonaro's trial [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=36.82s)]
*  a witch hunt. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=41.92s)]
*  Brazil's current president responded yesterday, promising that the country will match the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=43.08s)]
*  import taxes from the United States. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=47.68s)]
*  He also noted that the U.S. has a trade surplus of more than $410 billion with Brazil over [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=50.62s)]
*  the past 15 years. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=58.81999999999999s)]
*  President Trump also announced yesterday a 50 percent tariff on copper starting August [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=61.099999999999994s)]
*  1st. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=66.14s)]
*  The U.S. imports nearly half of the copper it uses, with most of it coming from Chile, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=67.24s)]
*  according to data from the U.S. Geological Survey. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=73.62s)]
*  Jonathan Lemire, what's going on here? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=76.78s)]
*  I mean, I guess it's a strategy if you want to describe it that way. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=80.5s)]
*  Well, the copper tariff, to be clear, is consequential. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=86.22s)]
*  It's economic. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=89.74s)]
*  It's going to pass on price hikes to consumers. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=90.74s)]
*  But the Brazil one is the one that really grabbed people's attention yesterday. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=92.9s)]
*  It's hard to take any other interpretation here. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=97.34s)]
*  This is purely political. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=99.3s)]
*  This isn't about the economy. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=100.76s)]
*  As noted, the U.S. has a trade surplus with Brazil. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=102.78s)]
*  So Trump's rationalization for so many of the other tariffs that he's applied on countries [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=106.14s)]
*  around the globe is the U.S. is running a deficit. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=111.7s)]
*  Now, economists, we've talked about on the show for months now, point out, well, that's [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=114.02s)]
*  okay at times. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=117.62s)]
*  You can have trade deficits in certain matters for certain goods. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=118.62s)]
*  That's how a global economy works. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=122.12s)]
*  That's not the case here. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=124.42s)]
*  So already his rationale is sort of schizophrenic. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=125.78s)]
*  But more than that, it's just overtly and nakedly political. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=128.46s)]
*  It's a punishment for a country, for Brazil, because it is prosecuting its former president, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=131.06s)]
*  Bolsonaro, who is a Trump ally, whose supporters in Brazil staged a January 6-like insurrection [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=137.38s)]
*  to try to overturn the results there. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=143.42000000000002s)]
*  It failed. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=146.98s)]
*  And now Bolsonaro is facing justice in that country. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=147.98000000000002s)]
*  But it's really raising concerns, Mika, because this is the first time he's weighed in like [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=150.96s)]
*  this. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=155.86s)]
*  The president, Trump, has using tariffs in a political way. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=156.86s)]
*  But he's made other threats. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=159.1s)]
*  Israel's another, where he has warned Israel that if the trial there of Prime Minister [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=160.14s)]
*  Netanyahu continues, another Trump ally, that he maybe would withhold aid or there would [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=163.66s)]
*  be tariffs with there. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=168.26s)]
*  So this is something to really watch. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=169.5s)]
*  And I know some Democrats yesterday sounding the alarms about just how personal and political [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=171.14s)]
*  this is. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=176.01999999999998s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=177.01999999999998s)]
*  And now this. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=178.74s)]
*  Former CIA Director John Brennan and former FBI Director James Comey are now both under [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=179.85999999999999s)]
*  criminal investigation by the Department of Justice. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=186.46s)]
*  Details surrounding the exact reasoning for the investigations are unclear. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=190.1s)]
*  But an NBC News source briefed on the matter said it was CIA Director John Ratcliffe who [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=195.9s)]
*  made the criminal referral of Brennan to the DOJ. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=201.42000000000002s)]
*  A lawyer for James Comey had no comment. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=205.86s)]
*  Brennan responded to the news of the investigation yesterday on MSNBC. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=208.70000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, well, as Yogi Berra has famously said, it's deja vu all over again. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=214.22s)]
*  It is hard to believe that here we are eight and a half years afterward, we're still going [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=218.42s)]
*  over this ground that has been, I think, fairly well and exhaustively plowed. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=222.46s)]
*  First of all, I should say I know nothing about this reported investigation or referral [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=227.3s)]
*  to the DOJ other than what I've read in these press reports. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=231.46s)]
*  I think this is, unfortunately, a very sad and tragic example of the continued politicization [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=235.06s)]
*  of the intelligence community, of the National Security process. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=241.82s)]
*  And, quite frankly, I'm really shocked that, you know, individuals who are willing to sacrifice [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=244.78s)]
*  their reputations, their credibility, their decency to continue to do Donald Trump's bidding [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=249.94s)]
*  on something that clearly is just politically based. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=255.42s)]
*  During the president's first term in office, Special Counsel John Durham was tasked with [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=260.9s)]
*  investigating the infamous 2017 Trump-Russia intelligence assessment. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=265.1s)]
*  Durham spent years and impaneled a grand jury for the probe, but in the end did not [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=270.5s)]
*  accuse either Comey or Brennan of any wrongdoing. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=276.02s)]
*  Even if anything could have happened, it would now be outside of the five-year statute of [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=281.1s)]
*  limitations for federal crimes. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=286.7s)]
*  We should note former CIA Director John Brennan is a paid MSNBC senior national security and [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=290.02s)]
*  intelligence analyst. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=296.58s)]
*  John and Lamir, especially in light of what we heard from Brennan himself, what's your [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=298.38s)]
*  take on both of these investigations, but also the implications overall? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=303.14s)]
*  Well, certainly the theory behind this is that they may have lied to Congress, but as [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=308.06s)]
*  you just noted, Mika, there may be no there there, and time may have, statute of limitations [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=313.58s)]
*  may have run out. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=318.06s)]
*  Anyway, I think in broader strokes, this is about potentially the president's campaign [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=319.21999999999997s)]
*  of retribution. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=324.54s)]
*  Just remember that Donald Trump during his campaign suggested that he would be his voters' [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=325.54s)]
*  retribution and suggested he would signal out his political adversaries once he got [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=331.02000000000004s)]
*  into office. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=335.46000000000004s)]
*  Now, we haven't seen much of that. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=336.46000000000004s)]
*  There has been a little bit. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=338.14000000000004s)]
*  Chris Krebs, Miles Teller, there's been a few former Trump officials who have come under [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=339.58000000000004s)]
*  scrutiny now. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=345.52000000000004s)]
*  There's been some investigations that even if they don't go anywhere, it would potentially [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=346.54s)]
*  cause these individuals to have to pay steep legal fees and the like. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=350.46000000000004s)]
*  And that's why I think it's important to have a lot of people who are willing to hire [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=354.9s)]
*  lawyers to defend themselves. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=359.34s)]
*  And certainly it's a campaign of intimidation. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=360.9s)]
*  That may be what's happening here, too. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=363.14s)]
*  I'm told there's a real divide in the Trump orbit as to whether or not it's worth it to [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=365.17999999999995s)]
*  pursue these types of probes, some close to the president, if counsels him not to do so. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=371.46s)]
*  Say, look, let the past be the past. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=376.85999999999996s)]
*  Move on. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=378.73999999999995s)]
*  Focus on governing. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=379.73999999999995s)]
*  Others say, no, you should go seek, quote, justice for what the misdeeds in their mind [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=380.73999999999995s)]
*  We'll have to see what happens as we learn more about these particular cases. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=383.9s)]
*  We'll also have to see whether other figures from Trump's first term, other political members [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=386.7s)]
*  in Washington also face potential DOJ investigations. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=391.29999999999995s)]
*  We of course will stay on it. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY_tL-78Ka4&t=395.46s)]
