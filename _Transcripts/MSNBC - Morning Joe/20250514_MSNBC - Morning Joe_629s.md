# Increasingly impossible to find food: Doctor on dire situation in Gaza
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20)
*  Thirty-six past the hour, three Israeli military officials familiar with the conditions in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=0.0s)]
*  Gaza tell the New York Times Palestinians in the territory face widespread starvation [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=6.44s)]
*  unless access to aid is restored within weeks. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=12.540000000000001s)]
*  Israel has insisted on its blockade on Gaza, which has been in effect since early March, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=16.56s)]
*  does not threaten civilians despite famine warnings from the UN. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  Joining us now, Dr. Aqsa Dehrani. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=27.2s)]
*  She's a board member of Doctors Without Borders, and she just returned to the U.S. from an [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=29.64s)]
*  assignment in Gaza, working at a field hospital. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=35.08s)]
*  Thank you so much for coming on the show. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=39.08s)]
*  Can you tell us what you saw in that hospital? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  What I saw was the manifestation and the result of these inhumane policies that you've just mentioned. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=46.8s)]
*  We, in our trauma field hospital, we saw children who were starving and hungry already. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=56.64s)]
*  And in the ICU where I worked, even early on in the siege, we had a one-year-old infant [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=66.72s)]
*  who had presented with burns resulting from an airstrike. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=73.56s)]
*  And at that point, the cost of food was already prohibitive for vulnerable families. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=79.28s)]
*  So his nutritional status overwhelmed, led to an infection, and then he ended up succumbing [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=84.88000000000001s)]
*  to his injuries. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  He died, and he was killed by this. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  So already we are seeing children who are impacted by this starvation. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  I also had another four-year-old patient who was also admitted for burns after an airstrike, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=106.12s)]
*  whose mother was begging me for more food. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=111.96000000000001s)]
*  And I had to tell her, I had to look her in the eyes and say, I don't have any, you know, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=115.24000000000001s)]
*  we don't have any additional food to give him. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=119.84s)]
*  And this is unconscionable given that there is food just miles away, you know, being blocked [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=123.12s)]
*  by the Israeli authorities. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=131.64000000000001s)]
*  It's systematic, it's deliberate, and it's cruel. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=133.68s)]
*  Dr. Durrani, thanks for being with us this morning. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=136.96s)]
*  Where is the food coming from that they're getting at all, the people of Gaza, these [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=140.6s)]
*  children? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  You're talking about these families. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=146.35999999999999s)]
*  If those humanitarian shipments aren't making it, then what's the source of their food? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  I'll tell you that for, you know, I was there for a few months, and for five weeks or six [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=152.44s)]
*  weeks before I left, I didn't see any, a single fruit. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=158.0s)]
*  I didn't see any, you know, natural sources of protein like chicken or eggs. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=161.72s)]
*  The sources of food that people have right now are processed, canned foods that, you [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=168.4s)]
*  know, that they may have had from before. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=174.72000000000003s)]
*  But all of that is dwindling. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=176.96s)]
*  We are seeing that even our staff, even the doctors, you know, nurses, everyone who's [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=178.88000000000002s)]
*  working at the hospital are eating one meal per day. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=183.96s)]
*  And they are still, you know, that those are the conditions that they're living in and [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=187.48000000000002s)]
*  providing care for their community. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=191.52s)]
*  Doctor, The New York Times is reporting that some Israeli military officials are concluding [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=195.64000000000001s)]
*  that Gaza is on the brink of starvation. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=200.36s)]
*  You were there for a few months. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=203.84s)]
*  How much did you see the situation deteriorate while you were there, and how close do you [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=205.32000000000002s)]
*  think Gaza is to people starving to death? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=209.96s)]
*  I can tell you that we have already seen—it is already too late. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=215.52s)]
*  Every day that this continues, it is criminal. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  It is criminal. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=223.12s)]
*  I have no other words. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=224.24s)]
*  We have already seen that, like I said, that children and women and men, that the people [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  are suffering from this inhumane siege. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=234.20000000000002s)]
*  And what is so—you know, makes us even more criminal is that their tiny bodies are being [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=238.60000000000002s)]
*  by airstrikes, and then we can't even manage to provide them with more food. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=248.28s)]
*  We have already seen these impacts. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=254.64s)]
*  We've already heard of deaths from malnutrition. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=257.4s)]
*  We've already heard of deaths all across the Strip. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=260.04s)]
*  We are screening more and more children for malnutrition. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=263.24s)]
*  So, you know, while we wait for this classification, we are—each day is—it's just too late. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=267.2s)]
*  I have no other words. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=278.52s)]
*  Dr. Durrani, this is David Ignatius in Washington. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=280.2s)]
*  I want to just ask you, the pressure of denying food and water to the people of Gaza is obviously [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=283.4s)]
*  intended to force some sort of political change where people will demand an end to the war. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=290.28000000000003s)]
*  Is that happening in Gaza? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=296.96000000000004s)]
*  How do people react to these terrible conditions that you're describing? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=298.8s)]
*  People are exhausted. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=302.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean, there is no aspect of life in Gaza that has not been touched by the violence. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=305.0s)]
*  People are traumatized. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=311.24s)]
*  This is exactly what international humanitarian law was intended to stop. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=314.56s)]
*  We are witnessing the Israeli authorities using aid as a bargaining chip, using aid [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=320.36s)]
*  as a weapon of war. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=329.16s)]
*  And this is exactly what the international framework that we have been—our organization [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=332.04s)]
*  has been providing aid under this framework for decades. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=338.64s)]
*  I have personally been doing this for decades, and this framework is being mocked before [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=342.36s)]
*  our eyes. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=348.32s)]
*  I mean, we are witnessing Israel using starvation as a weapon of war. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=349.4s)]
*  Dr. Durrani, this is Elizabeth B. Miller from The New York Times. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=360.28s)]
*  I wanted to ask you, you said that food is only a few miles away. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=364.2s)]
*  Is it just sitting there behind a blockade? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=367.24s)]
*  I mean, how—can you see it? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=370.36s)]
*  What are you all—you said you only eat one meal a day. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=372.71999999999997s)]
*  Where does that food come from? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=377.12s)]
*  Is that stockpiled? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=378.32s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, so when I entered, I—you know, we actually saw the trucks that were lined [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=381.59999999999997s)]
*  up at the border waiting to enter. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=388.68s)]
*  It's just surreal to look and see these trucks, that trucks beyond the field of vision, that [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=393.28s)]
*  they're lined up farther than the eye can see. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=400.68s)]
*  And yes, like I said, people are eating right now sources of food that are whatever they [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=405.2s)]
*  can find, canned food, things that are non-perishable. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=412.48s)]
*  But people are having more and more trouble finding food. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=417.28000000000003s)]
*  Every day I'm hearing more—I just returned, but I just heard from another staff member [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=420.92s)]
*  that he's having difficulty finding food for his children. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=426.0s)]
*  And, you know, it's becoming increasingly impossible to find any sources of food. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=429.52s)]
*  Doctors Without Borders board member, Dr. Aksa Dehraani, thank you very much for coming [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=436.52s)]
*  on the show today and telling the story of your experience there and for your work in [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=443.24s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=448.56s)]
*  Really appreciate it. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=449.88s)]
*  David Ignatius, I'm just curious. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=451.8s)]
*  Obviously, what's happening in Gaza not only is causing deep concern with international [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=457.47999999999996s)]
*  relief groups like the United Nations, Doctors Without Borders, but obviously talk about [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=466.44s)]
*  the growing concern inside of Israel itself. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=473.32s)]
*  Of course, the New York Times report was not based on Gaza health officials. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=476.23999999999995s)]
*  It was based on Israeli generals and their growing concerns about the situation there. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=484.4s)]
*  Take us inside Israel and talk about the growing concern about the humanitarian meltdown in [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=490.32s)]
*  Gaza and the possible approaching of famine. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=499.32s)]
*  Joe, for nearly a year, senior officials of the Israeli military have been telling me [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=503.08s)]
*  and others that they think that the military goals in Gaza have largely been achieved and [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=510.34s)]
*  it's time to move to a system of governance that shorthand is the day after the war and [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=514.9s)]
*  to think about how you'd get non-Hamas Palestinians in a position that they could take responsibility [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=522.38s)]
*  for law and order, for distribution of food, all these basics. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=529.38s)]
*  And the governor, Bibi Netanyahu, simply has refused to deal with these issues for political [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=533.62s)]
*  reasons. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=540.1s)]
*  It's a very fragile coalition, has right-wing members who don't want to see that. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=541.1s)]
*  And so we move forward month by month with this situation getting more and more desperate [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=544.94s)]
*  for the people without a plan for what comes next. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=549.98s)]
*  And what I hear from Israeli military officials, security officials, people who are closest [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=553.74s)]
*  to this war is increasingly a sense of just they're desperate. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=559.3000000000001s)]
*  One of them said to me, we don't know how to communicate our fears about the future. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=564.1800000000001s)]
*  We don't have anybody to talk to. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=569.06s)]
*  The political leadership in Israel won't listen to us. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=570.18s)]
*  So I think that the beginning of getting out of this terrible tragedy that Dr. Narani described [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=573.28s)]
*  is having a clear path for moving to post-war Gaza in which there's some stable leadership [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=578.68s)]
*  with non-Hamas Palestinians. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQB7ryyDC20&t=588.5s)]
