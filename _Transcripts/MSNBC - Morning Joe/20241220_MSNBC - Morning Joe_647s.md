# Thomas Friedman: How Swift, Musk can resolve U.S.-China relations
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [December 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ)
*  A pretty shot of the White House this morning decked out for the holidays exactly one month [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=0.0s)]
*  until Inauguration Day. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=8.28s)]
*  Earlier this week, China's foreign minister expressed a desire to work with the incoming [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=10.16s)]
*  Trump administration, saying he hoped the two countries would work together in a quote [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=15.24s)]
*  mutually beneficial manner to remove disruptions and overcome obstacles. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=19.6s)]
*  The comments put a spotlight on what may be the most consequential diplomatic relationship [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=25.26s)]
*  of Trump's second term. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=30.900000000000002s)]
*  But our next guest argues it's not just Trump and Xi who could figure prominently in the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=33.58s)]
*  partnership between the two countries. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=39.06s)]
*  Joining us now, foreign affairs columnist for the New York Times, Thomas Friedman. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=42.5s)]
*  His new piece for the Times is titled, How Elon Musk and Taylor Swift can resolve US-China [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=47.3s)]
*  Relations. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=54.38s)]
*  Let's dig in and read a little bit from it. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=55.38s)]
*  Beijing and Washington will be much better off with a bargain, one that imposes a gradual [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=58.06s)]
*  increase in US tariffs, while both of us do what we needed to do long ago. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=64.18s)]
*  What is that? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=70.46000000000001s)]
*  I call it the Elon Musk-Taylor Swift paradigm. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=71.82000000000001s)]
*  America would use higher tariffs on China to buy time to lift up more Elon Musk's, more [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=76.38s)]
*  homegrown manufacturers who can make big stuff so we can export more to the world and [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=82.9s)]
*  import less. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=88.46000000000001s)]
*  And China would use the time to let in more Taylor Swift's, more opportunities for its [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=90.42s)]
*  youth to spend money on entertainment and consumer goods made abroad, but also to make [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=95.86000000000001s)]
*  more goods and offer more services that its own people want to buy. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=101.74000000000001s)]
*  But if we don't use this time to respond to China the way we did to the Soviet Union's [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=107.24000000000001s)]
*  1957 launch of Sputnik, the world's first artificial satellite, with our own comprehensive, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=111.94s)]
*  scientific, innovative and industrial push, we will be toast. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=118.94s)]
*  Tom, so glad to see you this morning and I would admit I did a double take when I saw [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=123.86s)]
*  the two names mentioned in your headline and to the roles they could play, but elaborate [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=128.94s)]
*  further as to why you think this makes sense for both nations. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=135.5s)]
*  Well, first of all, John, great to be with you. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=139.78s)]
*  Obviously, I'm using them as a metaphor. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=141.9s)]
*  You know, the biggest thing I discovered on this trip to China, and I've been a regular [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=144.14000000000001s)]
*  visitor of less 30 years, although obviously I missed the years of COVID, is that while [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=147.26s)]
*  we were sleeping, that is, while we both were isolated by COVID and then we started to [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=151.58s)]
*  disengage with one another on top of it, China made a great leap forward in advanced [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=157.66s)]
*  manufacturing. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=162.3s)]
*  China's gone from about 6% of global manufacturing in the early 2000s to almost half [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=163.94s)]
*  today. One country, John, almost half. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=169.66s)]
*  And it's across a broad front. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=173.18s)]
*  And so basically what I was arguing is that we need to get back to if we're going to [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=175.9s)]
*  have tariffs on China, tariffs are just there to buy time. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=180.9s)]
*  They have to buy time for something. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=184.82s)]
*  They buy time for us to basically make our own great leap forward in advanced manufacturing [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=186.18s)]
*  again. We need more people like Elon Musk, not the Elon Musk you were talking about [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=192.06s)]
*  earlier in this hour. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=196.14000000000001s)]
*  I agree with every word Chris Matthews said, but we need people who can make big stuff, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=197.34s)]
*  bend metal, OK, satellites, you know, Internet systems, cars. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=201.74s)]
*  And we don't have enough of those. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=207.26s)]
*  Meanwhile, China, I said, if I were drawing a stick, a cartoon of China, it's a country [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=209.22s)]
*  with the upper body of Popeye. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=213.94s)]
*  He's still eating spinach. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=215.62s)]
*  That's its advanced export manufacturing side. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=216.74s)]
*  But it's got stick legs because there's no there's not no, but there's very little [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=220.14s)]
*  domestic consumption in part because all economies geared for exports and in part [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=224.46s)]
*  because the creative juices have not been unleashed there for domestic consumption. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=230.26s)]
*  So they need more Taylor Swift's. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=234.5s)]
*  They need more of their own creative talent. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=235.9s)]
*  They need letting in more creative talent. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=237.82s)]
*  So they're so young people can you know, girls just want to have fun. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=240.02s)]
*  So do Chinese and they and they're and they're not getting those opportunities. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=243.78s)]
*  Tom, is this I understand your argument, and I think it's a very clever one. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=248.06s)]
*  But is this at all realistic? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=254.46s)]
*  Number one, does is the United States actually going to start bending metal again? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=258.18s)]
*  Or are the are the next Elon Musk's going to come up with these these great ideas, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=265.18s)]
*  these great projects, these innovations, but do the manufacturing? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=271.22s)]
*  Elsewhere and find that that's more efficient than even with with reasonable tariffs applied. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=277.38s)]
*  Do we still have the skills and the mindset to do the metal bending here in the United States? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=287.82s)]
*  That's number one. And number two, is there any indication that she would like to have [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=295.9s)]
*  anything like Taylor Swift in China, the cultural figures who [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=302.74s)]
*  have this sort of independence of mind and voice that is simply not allowed in China? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=309.90000000000003s)]
*  It would need to be more satisfied just to have have had that aspect the way it is. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=317.58000000000004s)]
*  Well, you know, those are two very legitimate questions on the first, you know, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=323.86s)]
*  I would simply say after the Russians launched their Sputnik satellite in 1957, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=328.02s)]
*  we had a similar wake up moment and and we did make a massive investment in industrial manufacturing. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=332.78s)]
*  As I noted in the piece, I don't know if Donald Trump knows, but in in China, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=342.34s)]
*  his nickname on social media is Comrade Nation Builder. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=346.34s)]
*  He's been their Sputnik. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=350.21999999999997s)]
*  He woke them up that they better not to make more stuff, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=352.90000000000003s)]
*  but make more stuff that doesn't depend on the United States. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=357.82s)]
*  OK, that's number one. And your point on Taylor Swift and creativity in China and allowing in those things. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=360.42s)]
*  Jean, you're absolutely right. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=366.78000000000003s)]
*  That's not the inclination or direction of the of the Chinese leader right now. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=369.62s)]
*  And although like her record when it was released to streaming there was wildly popular. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=374.62s)]
*  And there was some talk about her giving concerts there. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=380.42s)]
*  But I tell you, they will have real problems if they don't. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=383.18s)]
*  They're young people feel choked. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=386.58000000000004s)]
*  If you the organizations that track rise of demonstrations in China have tracked [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=389.7s)]
*  a real substantial uptick lately and you can't keep people choked that way in the in the 21st century. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=394.74s)]
*  So this is a key moment. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=402.58000000000004s)]
*  You can you can love China, you can hate China in many days, I do both. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=405.90000000000003s)]
*  But this is a serious country when it comes to making stuff. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=409.94000000000005s)]
*  And while we we visit ourselves, basically manufacturing polarization and commenting on politics, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=416.74s)]
*  they have taken a great leap forward and really focused on manufacturing. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=426.70000000000005s)]
*  And we got to get focused. And again, it goes back to your previous segment. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=431.26000000000005s)]
*  Look at some of the people were pointing to key positions in science, in technology, in this country, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=435.02000000000004s)]
*  which is not serious. And and and Trump will find them. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=442.58000000000004s)]
*  They are not they want a deal. They don't want to fight here for sure. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=446.86s)]
*  But they won't be pushovers. They are a different country than Donald Trump dealt with eight years ago. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=451.06s)]
*  Tom, I'm curious, as you look at I get that tariffs provide space for a pause to allow us to try to catch up. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=456.34s)]
*  What's a little bit different now is we've got supply chain issues that are global. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=466.38s)]
*  And then we also have a real dependency of American agriculture on exports. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=471.14s)]
*  What happens in the interim? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=475.94s)]
*  What happens to the economies, the economy here in our country? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=477.78s)]
*  If we get into a tariff war that, yes, gives us a pause. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=482.42s)]
*  But what kind of damage is done during that interim to our overall economy? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=486.94s)]
*  Well, again, I'm talking about a negotiated tariff transition, not a war. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=491.9s)]
*  If we get into a war, you know, China has real resources, Claire, for the reasons you've just suggested. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=495.94s)]
*  We basically buy four things from them for every one thing they buy from us. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=503.65999999999997s)]
*  And most of that one thing now is soybeans and other agricultural products. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=509.58s)]
*  Imagine you're a rural farmer today and you're facing you're being told that we're cutting off immigration. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=515.06s)]
*  So you're going to lose a lot of your labor and you have to pay more for labor. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=521.38s)]
*  And China is going to buy a fewer agricultural goods from us. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=524.9s)]
*  So China has real, real resources there. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=528.5s)]
*  And on the manufacturing side, Israel, Israel levers there on the manufacturing side as well. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=532.18s)]
*  So I want to do everything I can to avoid a trade war. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=539.5s)]
*  Let me just step back for a second and put this into a larger context, at least the way I see it. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=542.9399999999999s)]
*  I think, you know, President Trump invited President Xi to his inauguration and people laughed and it was funny. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=548.9399999999999s)]
*  And it's obviously meant more tongue in cheek than anything else. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=553.9799999999999s)]
*  I don't think it was actually a bad idea. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=556.9399999999999s)]
*  We need to sit down with China for a deep dialogue because while we're engaging in a tariff war with each other, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=559.1s)]
*  the world is actually on the cusp of three civilizational threatening events, artificial general intelligence, climate change and spreading disorder. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=566.1s)]
*  What do I mean by spreading disorder? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=576.82s)]
*  Look at Israel today and the countries around it. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=578.58s)]
*  Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Iraq, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia, Eritrea. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=581.02s)]
*  They're all disintegrating. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue_PaW3PahQ&t=587.86s)]
