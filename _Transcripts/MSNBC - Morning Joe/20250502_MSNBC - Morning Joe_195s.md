# WH 'taking away' Harvard's tax exempt status, says Trump in social media post
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ)
*  Andrew, you mentioned one truth social post from the president. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=0.0s)]
*  I want to get your reaction to another. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=2.84s)]
*  A short time ago, he wrote this. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  We're going to be taking away Harvard's tax-exempt status. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=6.12s)]
*  It's what they deserve. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=9.68s)]
*  So tell us, tell the viewers here what that really means. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=10.68s)]
*  It's certainly a violation of significant norms, but what is it going to be the real [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=14.48s)]
*  world implications for that, for Harvard and any other institution that Trump may eventually [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=18.16s)]
*  target? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=22.76s)]
*  Look, first, I think it's worth noting this will go to court if, in fact, it were to happen. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=23.76s)]
*  I think it would be unlikely for the tax-exempt status to be removed. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=29.52s)]
*  The implication of such a thing, if it were to take place, would mean that donations to [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=34.12s)]
*  Harvard would not be tax deductible and that the money that the institution makes through [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=39.96s)]
*  its endowment in terms of investing and the like would also not be, would be taxed. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=46.260000000000005s)]
*  So that's the implication for the university, which would therefore mean, and by the way, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=52.36s)]
*  grants have been taken away from Harvard as well, would mean less money for students, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=57.48s)]
*  less money for research, less money all around. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=61.76s)]
*  That's what it would mean. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=64.92s)]
*  The question now is, is this something that he's targeting at Harvard specifically, in [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=65.92s)]
*  which case, by the way, because it would be so targeted, a court likely actually wouldn't [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=70.92s)]
*  uphold it, or is he going to do this to all universities around the country? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=76.2s)]
*  I think that would actually be very, very challenging politically, by the way, given [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=80.4s)]
*  sports programs at so many universities. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=85.8s)]
*  Could you imagine, for example, the president removing the tax status of Notre Dame? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=88.36s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=93.72s)]
*  I think that people would look at that and say that they don't want that. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=94.72s)]
*  So clearly this president thinks that he is going to somehow change the culture of Harvard [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=98.16s)]
*  University and some of these other Ivy League schools. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=104.08000000000001s)]
*  He's arguing it's about anti-Semitism, but he's also suggesting it now it's about ideology. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=108.08000000000001s)]
*  Of course, on the other side, there's the question about free speech and whether private [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=114.56s)]
*  universities should be able to have the kind of free speech that they want. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=118.6s)]
*  This is not to suggest that things shouldn't be improved at these universities, and clearly [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=122.16s)]
*  there have been problems. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=127.2s)]
*  But the idea that the administration is going to target Harvard like this, and I just say [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=129.3s)]
*  one last thing. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=133.76s)]
*  When you think about it, Harvard is one of the great institutions in America. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=135.14s)]
*  He's talked about trying to protect and embolden great institutions in America, and it is one [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=138.84s)]
*  And have there been problems at that university? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=144.54s)]
*  100%. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=146.54s)]
*  But when you think about all of the amazing talent and things that have been generated [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=147.54s)]
*  out of that school, it just seems, you know, it's very difficult to understand how this [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=152.06s)]
*  could help that. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=159.14000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, some real problems, but anti-Semitism has also been used as a cover for a lot of [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=160.34s)]
*  what this administration is trying to do. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=164.22s)]
*  Trump took a number of swipes last night at Harvard while he delivered a commencement [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=165.58s)]
*  address at the University of Alabama. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=168.7s)]
*  CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin, thank you so much. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=170.66s)]
*  And Peter Baker, the other big headline. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IEVLuMmcLQ&t=173.9s)]
