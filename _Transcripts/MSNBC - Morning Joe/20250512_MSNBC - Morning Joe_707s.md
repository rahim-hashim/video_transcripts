# Wall Street loves what they're hearing: Andrew Ross Sorkin on on tariff agreement
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA)
*  So, David Drucker, let's talk about—we had the Treasury Secretary on earlier this morning, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=0.0s)]
*  talked about this China deal. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=6.72s)]
*  He'd actually set expectations fairly low at the beginning of the weekend, saying he [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  didn't know if they were going to be able to get to a deal. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=11.72s)]
*  They in fact have got to a 90-day pause. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=13.52s)]
*  I'm curious, does this play in line with what the Trump administration's been expecting [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=18.76s)]
*  all along? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=24.28s)]
*  Again, set up tough goals, tough standards, and hopefully move the Chinese to a concession [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=25.36s)]
*  here. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=35.32s)]
*  It's unclear, Joe. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=36.32s)]
*  We could end up where the administration wanted to be, which was to break down Chinese tariffs, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=38.08s)]
*  make it easier for the U.S. to export to China, and to deal with this fentanyl crisis that [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=45.88s)]
*  the administration blames China for, and that China does have a lot of culpability [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=50.84s)]
*  for. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=55.24s)]
*  But again, we're in a situation where we have a framework of a deal, but no deal. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=56.24s)]
*  We have a pause, but no conclusion in negotiations. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=60.2s)]
*  So it's definitely a more positive environment, and we're in a much better place than we were [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=63.28s)]
*  at the beginning of the trade action instigated by the president. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=69.16s)]
*  But we just don't know where this is going to end up. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=73.44s)]
*  And we continue to hear different messages from the administration, and maybe that's [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=75.92s)]
*  the way they want it. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=79.60000000000001s)]
*  On the one hand, you'll listen to Secretary of the Treasury Scott Besant talk about the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=80.75999999999999s)]
*  fact that the U.S. does want trade. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=87.16s)]
*  They just want it more balanced. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=89.6s)]
*  And then you will hear often Trump and some others around him talk about the fact that [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=91.47999999999999s)]
*  we don't really need trade, that if we don't trade, the country saves money, and that the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=95.28s)]
*  point is to reshore manufacturing that has been offshored to China and other Asian nations. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=100.0s)]
*  So I just think this continues to be fluid, although clearly from an investment perspective. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=107.08s)]
*  And if you're an American business that depends on Chinese imports, today is a much better [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=113.72s)]
*  day for you than yesterday. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=118.67999999999999s)]
*  A much better day. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=121.28s)]
*  Jonathan Martin, you look at Wall Street. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=122.28s)]
*  Obviously, those numbers are going up. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=123.92s)]
*  I've always found it interesting that you can talk to, whether you're talking to Wall [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=126.56s)]
*  Street CEOs or economists, you can talk to people who have been the fiercest free trade [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=133.20000000000002s)]
*  advocates through the years. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=139.56s)]
*  And even they will say, China's screwing us. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  China's taking advantage of us. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=145.84s)]
*  I hear it all the time. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=147.76s)]
*  I'm sure you hear it all the time, too. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=148.76s)]
*  And I'm not talking about like right now. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=150.32s)]
*  I'm talking about this is something I've heard over the past decade. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=152.36s)]
*  I'm for free trade, but dot dot dot. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=155.44s)]
*  And then they'll say China really has to come to the table because they're screwing [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=160.48s)]
*  us right now. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=164.98s)]
*  So I'm curious your reaction to what the Treasury Secretary has announced and how tough it's [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=166.11999999999998s)]
*  going to be getting to where the Trump administration wants to get to have a trade deal that rebalances [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=171.28s)]
*  what many business owners think is an unbalanced trade system against the U.S. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=179.79999999999998s)]
*  Well, let's start with the palace intrigue part of this. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=187.04s)]
*  Scott Besson obviously has now taken the lead, Joe, over over Peter Navarro and the internal [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=190.32s)]
*  jockey. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=196.35999999999999s)]
*  Look, Peter Navarro said last month that the tariffs were here to stay. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  This was not leverage. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=201.72s)]
*  This was set policy that has proven to be emphatically untrue. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=203.48s)]
*  Look at last week, we did a deal with the Brits and now the framework to bring down [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=208.35999999999999s)]
*  tariffs with the Chinese navigated by Scott Besson. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=212.96s)]
*  That's why the markets are reacting, Joe, like they are, because this is bigger than [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=217.3s)]
*  just a Chinese deal. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=221.5s)]
*  This says that the tariffs are not here to stay. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=222.66000000000003s)]
*  This is the opening bid for negotiations. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=226.22s)]
*  That's number one. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=229.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=230.02s)]
*  Number two, Joe, you're absolutely right on the Chinese piece of this. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=231.02s)]
*  In fact, some could argue that the biggest dove left in American politics on China is [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=233.66000000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump himself because Trump so eagerly wants to do big deals with, you know, other [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=239.5s)]
*  countries, whether on security or trade. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=246.06s)]
*  But for a year, certainly in the Biden era, Joe, there was a bipartisan consensus toward, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=249.06s)]
*  you know, a hard line on China, especially on the security front, but also increasingly [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=255.5s)]
*  on the trade front. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=260.7s)]
*  And I think that is now more in question because you have a president who is eager to do, as [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=261.86s)]
*  he calls them, big, beautiful deals, no matter who the interlocutor is. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=267.22s)]
*  Well, here's Treasury Secretary Scott Besson on with us earlier this morning talking about [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=272.02s)]
*  where things go from here with China. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=277.82s)]
*  Well, Joe, this is going to go where the president wants it to go. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=283.02s)]
*  I was in touch with him over the weekend and he wants free trade, free and fair trade. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=285.98s)]
*  We've had free trade. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=293.3s)]
*  And as you said, that has not worked for the American people. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=294.74s)]
*  There's something called the China shock, which has gutted our manufacturing sector. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=298.65999999999997s)]
*  And China has a different form of government for us. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=304.7s)]
*  They have a different economic model where they subsidize labor, they subsidize capital [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=308.18s)]
*  goods, and they have exported that to us and the rest of the world. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=313.74s)]
*  We have put up tariffs to push back on that. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=318.74s)]
*  So it will be a matter of what is the equilibrium level on tariffs and also getting China to [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=322.06s)]
*  open their markets for American companies. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=330.14s)]
*  Let's bring in right now the co-anchor of CBC Squawk Box and New York Times columnist, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=334.5s)]
*  Andrew Osokin. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=338.06s)]
*  Andrew, there's I was trying to talk about on Friday may not have been as articulate [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=339.34000000000003s)]
*  as I wanted to be, but the US-UK trade deal that again, the outlines of the deal that a lot of people [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=347.38s)]
*  were kind of digging through all the details on, I saw that as a positive deal, especially [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=356.90000000000003s)]
*  because it's with the country we have a special relationship with. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=364.1s)]
*  But I thought it suggested that we may be moving now into the second phase. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=366.94s)]
*  The first phase was Donald Trump setting these high, high numbers for negotiations. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=371.9s)]
*  The second phase may be now using that leverage to get deals. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=376.97999999999996s)]
*  Looks like Wall Street likes what they're hearing so far this morning. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=382.02s)]
*  What's what's your reporting tell you? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=385.53999999999996s)]
*  Look, I think Wall Street loves what they're hearing in part because the expectation of [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=388.7s)]
*  these massive tariffs seem to be coming down and it seems to be ultimately not going to be the [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=393.5s)]
*  strategy of the United States to pursue them. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=399.42s)]
*  We will see ultimately what that what that looks like. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=402.62s)]
*  But as you know, just I think it was Friday, President Trump was talking about 80 percent [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=404.94s)]
*  tariffs on China. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=409.06s)]
*  Now we're talking effectively about 30 percent, this 10 percent plus this 20 percent related to [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=410.58000000000004s)]
*  Fentanyl. And maybe that's a negotiating tool to get them down ultimately to 10 percent. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=415.90000000000003s)]
*  So I think that for the global economy and for the markets, if this is in fact a reset, this is a [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=421.06s)]
*  very, very good thing. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=427.62s)]
*  I think there is a question mark, of course, as to what that ultimately means to some of the other [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=429.14s)]
*  goals that the administration has laid out around bringing revenue into the United States in the [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=433.9s)]
*  form of tariffs, how that will affect tax policy and budgets and the like, given that actually, if [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=439.5s)]
*  you bring the rates down, of course, you won't be collecting that revenue. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=446.97999999999996s)]
*  And so you're going to have to try to make up the taxes and make the budget in a different way. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=449.9s)]
*  There's a question mark about bringing back manufacturing to the United States. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=454.26000000000005s)]
*  If, in fact, these tariffs were going to be super high, that actually might have been an argument for [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=458.42s)]
*  certain companies to come back to the United States if they're super low or they're [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=463.5s)]
*  non-existent. That may not happen. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=466.94000000000005s)]
*  So I think there's just and this is why there's been so many different cross currents and also [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=469.02000000000004s)]
*  different almost factions inside the White House. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=472.86s)]
*  You know, you just talked about the Navarro camp versus the Besson camp. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=476.82000000000005s)]
*  Clearly, right now, the Besson camp is winning and the markets and this economy and I imagine many [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=480.14000000000004s)]
*  global leaders like the Besson camp better. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=485.70000000000005s)]
*  You know, Jonathan O'meer, it's so important that people don't overread what they can do and they [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=489.38s)]
*  want to do. But if they want to understand what's going on inside the White House, it's important [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=495.98s)]
*  not to overread and break too much in one direction, where last week before the UK deal and [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=500.62s)]
*  before the China deal, it was the sky is falling and we're going to have massive tariffs on every [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=508.3s)]
*  country forever. Now we have a couple of possibilities, outlines of deals or sort of an [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=514.22s)]
*  economic ceasefire with China. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=520.82s)]
*  And now we're hearing, oh, Donald Trump's backing off. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=523.22s)]
*  He's blinking. He's on retreat. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=526.9s)]
*  All my reporting from people close to Donald Trump over the weekend was he has believed in tariffs [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=529.58s)]
*  since 1987. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=535.62s)]
*  He continues to believe in tariffs and he still thinks that's the best way forward, just not at the high [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=537.42s)]
*  rates where he started with. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=545.3s)]
*  Again, what I still believe were his opening bids. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=548.18s)]
*  Yeah, that's certainly been one of the schools of thought here is that this is all part of [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=553.58s)]
*  negotiations. This is the art of the deal, if you will, and that Trump no doubt firmly believes in [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=557.02s)]
*  tariffs. There aren't many things that he has been ideologically consistent about. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=562.54s)]
*  Tariffs clearly one of them. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=566.18s)]
*  But Andrew, you raise a good point, though, that there are tariffs for those who have all these [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=567.86s)]
*  benefits, including paying for the huge tax cut that Republicans want to pass. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=571.18s)]
*  If that revenue is gone, that's a real issue and makes life on Capitol Hill that much harder. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=575.4599999999999s)]
*  But talk to us also, even if even if it's not a blink, even if it's just part of negotiations, we can [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=581.74s)]
*  assess it any way you want. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=586.5s)]
*  But that's true for perhaps how the White House is viewing it. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=588.0999999999999s)]
*  But what about the rest of the world? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=592.34s)]
*  It just the up the topsy turviness of the last six weeks and so-called Liberation Day that has [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=593.6999999999999s)]
*  really undermined faith and confidence in the United States around the globe. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=599.26s)]
*  Are these are the countries and businesses going to feel that much more comfortable investing in the [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=602.5s)]
*  United States? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=608.18s)]
*  Well, look, I think that the argument that the administration would make and I think that they're [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=610.02s)]
*  right long term. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=613.74s)]
*  And there's a complicated question shorter term, which is we still are a great investment in a [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=615.9s)]
*  relative world in terms of where you can put your money. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=621.5s)]
*  The U.S. may ultimately be the best place to put it. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=624.74s)]
*  The question is whether if you think that there is a distrust or an upset, if you will, and we've [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=628.06s)]
*  seen that in the context of travel from Canada and other places, there can be short term hits and [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=633.34s)]
*  there can be a sense that that trust is lost. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=638.66s)]
*  And in the short term, I think there is an argument to be made that it could affect things. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=642.5s)]
*  Having said that, all of the soft numbers, this is what economists look at, they call the hard [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=647.4599999999999s)]
*  numbers the soft numbers. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=651.74s)]
*  The soft numbers indicate that the economy should be softening. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=652.9399999999999s)]
*  The hard numbers haven't that hasn't happened yet. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=656.2199999999999s)]
*  We've all been looking and waiting for this this moment to happen. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=658.86s)]
*  This inflection point. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=663.3399999999999s)]
*  And everybody says, well, maybe it's going to happen in June. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=664.3s)]
*  Maybe it's going to happen in July. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=666.4599999999999s)]
*  And by the way, it very well may. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=667.5799999999999s)]
*  And so I think we're going to have to look for that. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=669.9799999999999s)]
*  You know, you talk to CEOs, they talk about their own paralysis. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=671.8199999999999s)]
*  But again, it hasn't shown up in the numbers yet. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=674.86s)]
*  And that's why the markets are basically it's almost like a time machine. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=678.1s)]
*  It's the markets are where they were basically before Liberation Day. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-eBp_NcfXA&t=681.78s)]
