# How J.D. Vance went from thoughtful to being hostile and what it says about the country
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw)
*  Tell us about the talented Mr. Vance. He's talented. He's impressive. I went [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=0.0s)]
*  back and reread Hillbilly Elegy almost ten years after it was first published. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=7.44s)]
*  It's a really good book. He's a good writer. He wrote it as a 30 year old [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=11.96s)]
*  sort of self-reflective, earnest, painfully honest young man who was [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=19.72s)]
*  telling us the story of his upbringing in southwestern Ohio from a family of [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=28.24s)]
*  what he called Hillbillies, a family that was suffering from addiction, poverty, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=33.199999999999996s)]
*  and a kind of collapse, a cultural collapse even, and he was incredibly [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=38.2s)]
*  honest about it. It struck me as a strange voice to hear now because it [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=43.72s)]
*  sounds nothing like the vice president who I've been reading, listening to, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=49.959999999999994s)]
*  trying to get a complete sense of the public record over the past few months. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=56.44s)]
*  It doesn't sound like the guy who talks about childless cat ladies or who points [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=61.64s)]
*  a finger in the face of the Ukrainian president or who makes up lies about [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=67.48s)]
*  Haitian immigrants eating native-born Americans pets in Springfield, Ohio. So [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=73.36s)]
*  for me there's a mystery as to who this man is and how both voices are possible [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=79.52s)]
*  in the same human being. And the answer I think says almost more about America [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=85.72s)]
*  today than it does about JD Vance. Every human being remains a mystery to [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  everyone else and I don't pretend to have figured him out, but what it does [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=95.68s)]
*  show is a kind of failure of the country at every step of Vance's rise, which has [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=99.72s)]
*  been remarkable, which has been just a kind of storybook rise at age 40 to the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=106.2s)]
*  vice presidency. There's been an American failure at every turn and we can go [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=111.12s)]
*  through each of them if we have time, but that's the main takeaway that I've got [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=116.16000000000001s)]
*  from having spent a lot of time reading him, listening to him. Yeah, you know, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  George, we're all used to politicians sort of tacking, going this way or that [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=125.36s)]
*  way. You know, George H.W. Bush being pro-choice his entire life, being picked by [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=130.88s)]
*  Ronald Reagan and becoming pro-life. We've seen Donald Trump go from pro-choice [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=138.12s)]
*  to being pro-life and we've seen other politicians, when it makes sense they [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=143.84s)]
*  will tact one direction, they will tact another. With JD Vance, it seems we have [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=148.88s)]
*  two different, completely different people. We have the guy that we all knew [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=155.84s)]
*  that would come on Morning Joe, that would talk about Hillbilly Elegy, that [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  was the darling, not only of Silicon Valley, but also of the East Coast elites [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  that he now attacks. He, of course, went to great schools and colleges. But you [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=169.8s)]
*  also had, it seemed, a thoughtful, introspective JD Vance in texts and [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=176.24s)]
*  emails that surfaced later. A very thoughtful, introspective JD Vance. And [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=182.12s)]
*  then you had the JD Vance of 2016 suggesting that Donald Trump was Hitler [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=188.04s)]
*  and suggesting that Christians shouldn't vote for him. So there's that [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=193.28s)]
*  JD Vance. And then you have the one that emerged, especially emerged during the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=198.4s)]
*  campaign. We all know that there are the two JD Vances. I'm curious in your [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=203.56s)]
*  searching for the talented Mr. Vance, when did that transition take place? How [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=210.68s)]
*  did it take place? Was there a road on Damascus, road to Damascus moment that at [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=218.67999999999998s)]
*  least he made up if it didn't actually happen, where he went from saying all [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=225.83999999999997s)]
*  these things about Donald Trump to being his biggest advocate? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=230.88s)]
*  That's a good question. It took a few years, and I don't think there was any [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=235.04s)]
*  single epiphany. But you have to imagine there was something a little repellent [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=239.27999999999997s)]
*  to JD Vance to be sitting at dinner with super rich CEOs, explaining the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=244.16000000000003s)]
*  pathologies of his hometown and having them nod and smile because their own [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=249.8s)]
*  contempt for the working class is being confirmed. At a certain point, that role [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=255.36s)]
*  must have revolted Vance. There's a crucial moment when Hillbilly Elegy is [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=259.44s)]
*  published, Trump wins in 2016. Suddenly Vance is a national voice explaining the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=266.44s)]
*  white working class to the educated class. And at that same moment, Vance's [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=273.12s)]
*  political ambitions, which until then had been on a rather moderate [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=279.92s)]
*  conservative course. He supported John Huntsman in 2012, who made Mitt Romney [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=284.12s)]
*  look extreme. Suddenly that path is blocked, and that's a crisis if you're a [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=290.28000000000003s)]
*  young, ambitious JD Vance. It took about four years from 2016, 17 to 2021 for him [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=296.28s)]
*  to reappear as a fire breathing culture warrior of the right. And I wanted in [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=305.44s)]
*  this piece to give him a kind of good faith credit for a genuine change of [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=312.15999999999997s)]
*  view on policies. He had been against tariffs, he began to support them. He [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=317.11999999999995s)]
*  had not been obsessed with immigration, he began to be obsessed with [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=321.84s)]
*  immigration, etc. In other words, I don't want to say his move toward Trumpism [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=325.59999999999997s)]
*  was a completely opportunistic thing. I think there may have been experiences [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=332.2s)]
*  things when he moved back to Ohio that he saw that his own people, his friends [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=336.44s)]
*  were big Trump supporters, maybe he saw a reason for that. What I find remarkable [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=340.55999999999995s)]
*  is that he went from being that thoughtful, reflective and, and [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=345.4s)]
*  respectful young man to being vituperative and hostile and demonizing [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=350.96s)]
*  large groups of his fellow Americans while asking them to elect him to [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=358.71999999999997s)]
*  represent them. That's the change that to me reflects something ugly in the [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=363.15999999999997s)]
*  country that our culture, our media culture, our political culture had [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=369.4s)]
*  turned so rancid by that time, that in order to win, in order to get to power, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=373.64s)]
*  Vance had to sort of betray his own decency and become a kind of spokesman [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=379.56s)]
*  for a pretty ugly side of MAGA. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=388.0s)]
*  So, George, there was, and I want to emphasize the past tense of was, a [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=390.84s)]
*  moment in J.D. Vance's life that at least I saw and clearly you saw, where [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=396.4s)]
*  he could have assumed sort of a Robert F. Kennedy role in our politics. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=403.44s)]
*  Robert F. Kennedy could go to Gary, Indiana, when he was running for [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=408.84s)]
*  president in 68, and have white steel workers following him and trying to [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=412.15999999999997s)]
*  touch him and adoring him and voting for him. He could stand up in Indianapolis [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=417.23999999999995s)]
*  the night that Martin Luther King died and give an epic, epic speech, perhaps [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=422.52s)]
*  the finest off the cuff speech any American politician ever gave. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=427.68s)]
*  J.D. Vance had that in him once, I would think, but then he comes to the [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=431.15999999999997s)]
*  crossroads of integrity and ambition, and he takes a right-hand turn on ambition. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=436.68s)]
*  You write in part in this piece. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=443.28s)]
*  Let's see if I can find it here. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=446.35999999999996s)]
*  I just put it up. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=447.91999999999996s)]
*  Hold on. Hold on. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=450.4s)]
*  My chronicle with a phone. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=452.2s)]
*  Okay, good thing we have a four-hour show. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=453.59999999999997s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=456.59999999999997s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=457.96s)]
*  That was fast. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=458.4s)]
*  He's got it. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=459.08s)]
*  Not too bad. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=459.84s)]
*  Vance is a politician with an unusual interest in ideas and a combative nature [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=460.4s)]
*  fed by an old wound. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=466.36s)]
*  The combination makes him capable of going a long way down an ideological road [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=468.8s)]
*  without paying attention to the casualties around him. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=474.4s)]
*  Who is he? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=479.03999999999996s)]
*  That reminds me a little bit of Richard Nixon. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=481.84s)]
*  There is that sense of grievance from his youth that Nixon had, that intelligence, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=486.76s)]
*  incredible intelligence in both of them, and that hardness and willingness to see [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=494.0s)]
*  other people suffer at his hands, you could say. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=502.88s)]
*  I don't mean physically, but certainly politically and just, I mean, Vance is [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=505.4s)]
*  getting into these fights on X with random Xers, tweeters, whatever you call [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=510.36s)]
*  them these days, who say something about a policy and he comes back at them with [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=516.32s)]
*  profanity. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=521.36s)]
*  It's as if one notion I had was that he has sort of been able to liberate himself [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=522.6800000000001s)]
*  from having been civilized by the meritocracy. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=529.32s)]
*  He went to Yale. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=533.64s)]
*  He married this very talented, very intelligent Yale, who kind of taught him [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=535.0799999999999s)]
*  how to be an Ivy Leaguer, that you had to figure out that there are different [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=541.0799999999999s)]
*  varieties of white wine. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=545.92s)]
*  This is all in Hillbilly Elegy. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=547.36s)]
*  And there must have been some kind of pressure, internal pressure to conform to [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=549.68s)]
*  that. And now he's been liberated from it because those are the enemy. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=554.4399999999999s)]
*  The Ivy League is the enemy. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=559.76s)]
*  He gave a speech in which he said the professors are the enemy, which is a quote [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=560.8399999999999s)]
*  from Richard Nixon. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=566.28s)]
*  So I think there must be a kind of freedom in being able to go on X and get into [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=567.5999999999999s)]
*  fights and any challenge to his honor. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=574.9599999999999s)]
*  He's going to come right back at it. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=578.9599999999999s)]
*  It's a little bit like the culture that he describes in Hillbilly Elegy as Hillbilly [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=580.7199999999999s)]
*  culture. And to me, there's a kind of relief at being able to do that at the [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV7U-CGOkdw&t=584.88s)]
