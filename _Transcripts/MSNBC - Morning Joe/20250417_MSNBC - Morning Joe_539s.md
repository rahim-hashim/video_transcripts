# Tesla hits bump in the road as sales slip: Steve Rattner
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU)
*  As billionaire Elon Musk continues his work with the Department of Government Inficiency, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=0.0s)]
*  he has not spoken much about his company, Tesla. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  As new data shows, its electronic vehicle, well, the sales fell almost 9 percent in the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=9.88s)]
*  first three months of 2025. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=17.04s)]
*  What could be behind that? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=19.98s)]
*  Steve Ratner has made his way over to the southwest wall with his charts. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=21.52s)]
*  Let's start with Tesla. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=25.72s)]
*  What's going on there, Steve? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=26.84s)]
*  Yeah, Meek, as you said, Tesla has actually hit a bit of a bump in the road, no pun intended. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=28.08s)]
*  But you can see here that Tesla in its early years had huge sales increases, as you would [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=33.28s)]
*  expect, very popular, one of the few makers of really good electric vehicles in the country. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=37.4s)]
*  But beginning in 2025, its sales kind of stagnated, a combination of really two reasons. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=42.620000000000005s)]
*  One, some competition, more competition from other people trying to get in the business, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=47.68s)]
*  including domestic manufacturers. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=51.8s)]
*  And also the fact that people are getting their models Y and S, two of their most popular [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=54.36s)]
*  models, getting a little bit long in the tooth, so to speak. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=58.56s)]
*  But look what happened here in the first quarter. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=62.519999999999996s)]
*  In the first quarter, their sales went down 13 percent, more than they've ever done before. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=64.92s)]
*  That's across the world. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=69.76s)]
*  If you look at just the U.S., you can see that all U.S. EV sales were actually up 11 [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=70.92s)]
*  percent, and Tesla was down 9. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=75.84s)]
*  And so what I think you are starting to see, and I'll get to this a bit more in a second, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=78.44s)]
*  you are starting to see Musk's unpopularity weigh on Tesla's sales. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=83.68s)]
*  Some of it is expected, their market share, when you start with a very, very high market [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=89.52000000000001s)]
*  share, really only one way to go. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=92.92s)]
*  And as I said, other people are making them. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=94.4s)]
*  But look what happened in Europe in the first quarter. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=96.4s)]
*  In Europe, their market share dropped enormously. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=98.44000000000001s)]
*  And this, I do think, is heavily related to the unpopularity of both American products, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=101.76s)]
*  frankly, as well as Elon Musk in Europe. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=106.72s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=109.2s)]
*  And so Tesla tanking, what's the reason behind it? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=110.2s)]
*  So yes, you can see the Tesla stock back in September, October was down here. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=113.68s)]
*  It had this, when Trump was elected, it took this huge run up because people thought that [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=120.04s)]
*  Musk was simply going to be a great beneficiary of the federal government's largesse. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=124.4s)]
*  And then you can see that along with all the chaos and commotion and Trump's own personal [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=130.8s)]
*  issues, you can see Tesla stocks gone all the way back down. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=136.16s)]
*  Morgan Stanley did a survey and they found that 85% of investors think that Musk's political [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=139.67999999999998s)]
*  activities are going to have a negative impact on Tesla's business fundamentals. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=144.64s)]
*  And so again, I think the market is starting to say that Musk is becoming too hot to handle, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=148.83999999999997s)]
*  so to speak. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=154.55999999999997s)]
*  But one other point about Musk that's worth making, which is that for all his talk about [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=155.55999999999997s)]
*  being anti-government, anti-government programs and things like that, Tesla has been an unbelievable [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=159.79999999999998s)]
*  beneficiary of government largesse. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=165.88s)]
*  And so this is year by year, you can see here, the biggest piece of all of this, about $1.7 [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=168.32s)]
*  billion, are electric vehicle credits that Tesla sells to other automakers who are forced [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=174.8s)]
*  to comply with our electric vehicle and our fuel emission standards. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=180.6s)]
*  So ironically, a program that Trump has talked about killing is one of the ones that Musk [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=185.0s)]
*  has been the biggest beneficiary of. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=190.44s)]
*  So let's just talk about Musk overall and Doge. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=192.28s)]
*  I mean, the promises were, I don't know, target cutting $150 billion, $2 trillion annually [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=196.12s)]
*  from the budget. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=204.6s)]
*  I mean, they went in there, a bunch of people, with I believe no clearance, no cabinet position. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=205.6s)]
*  So there's those issues and those questions that have a lot of us wondering. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=210.92s)]
*  But OK, so what's been the outcome of these grand projections? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=216.64s)]
*  So yeah, as you said, there's been an enormous amount of commotion. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=220.48s)]
*  You've had a bunch of people lose their jobs. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=223.44s)]
*  You've had confusion all over the place. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=225.32s)]
*  What do we have to show for it? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=227.4s)]
*  Well, back during the campaign, Trump claimed that he was going to cut $2 trillion from [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=228.72s)]
*  our annual budget. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=233.08s)]
*  And by the way, our annual budget is $7 trillion. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=234.12s)]
*  So you're talking about, he would have been talking obviously about a massive, massive [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=236.82s)]
*  cut. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  They quickly realized that was not successful in January. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=240.92000000000002s)]
*  They said, we'll cut a trillion out of the budget. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=243.84s)]
*  And by the way, the government's fiscal year is now more than half over anyway. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=246.36s)]
*  But then on April 10th, they lowered it to $150 billion. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=250.56s)]
*  So $2 trillion, $1 trillion, $150 billion. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=254.4s)]
*  But even the $150 billion, the New York Times did a very thorough investigation of this. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=255.88s)]
*  $92 billion of it is unspecified. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=260.84000000000003s)]
*  Nobody knows where that's coming from. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=263.68s)]
*  Of the other $63 billion, there were all kinds of mistakes, including, for example, a contract [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=265.52s)]
*  for $1.9 billion they claim credit for actually canceled during the Biden administration. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=270.2s)]
*  So for all the commotion, all the layoffs, all the unhappy people, there's very little [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=275.72s)]
*  to show for it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=280.44s)]
*  And I think that most clearly over here, because this tracks federal spending month [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=281.44s)]
*  by month since the beginning of each year, back from 2022. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=286.16s)]
*  And as you would expect, it went up a little bit in 23, a little bit in 24. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=290.16s)]
*  But it's actually gone up a good bit in 25. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=294.52s)]
*  So there's still no impact whatsoever on government spending from all of, as I said, the commotion [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=296.96s)]
*  that Musk has created in Washington. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=302.64s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=304.8s)]
*  Morning, Joe. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=305.8s)]
*  Economic analyst Steve Ratner, thank you very much for coming on this morning. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=306.8s)]
*  John Hollman, your thoughts on how Doge is doing. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=310.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, Mika, to Steve's point, I think some of us said from the very beginning that given [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=317.0s)]
*  the composition of the federal government and the federal budget, given how much of [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=324.64s)]
*  that goes to the big entitlement programs and defense spending, that you are not going [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=328.91999999999996s)]
*  to have much of an impact on the budget unless you started to take on some of those large [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=334.32s)]
*  programs. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=338.68s)]
*  And so Elon Musk, he put his hand on the hot stove when he talked about how Social Security [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=339.68s)]
*  is a Ponzi scheme. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=346.36s)]
*  People immediately bridled that. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=348.16s)]
*  That became a political liability for the Trump team. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=350.20000000000005s)]
*  And Elon Musk made himself, as you'll remember, the face of that Wisconsin judicial election. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=354.32000000000005s)]
*  He took a drubbing there. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=359.56s)]
*  There's now been a lot of data that's looked at that election that showed that for all [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=361.68s)]
*  the money that he spent on that conservative judicial Supreme Court candidate, that he [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=365.28000000000003s)]
*  actually hurt the candidate more than he helped the candidate. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=369.24s)]
*  And the Trump administration very quickly has been kind of ditching Musk and decoupling [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=373.16s)]
*  itself from Musk because he's become so unpopular. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=378.52s)]
*  And just to get back to one thing Steve was saying a second ago, I am not a stock market [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=381.28000000000003s)]
*  analyst, but I'll tell you, when a thing starts to have a name out in America, Tesla Regret [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=386.52s)]
*  Syndrome, people are out there in the world right now peeling the Tesla, the logo, but [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=392.52s)]
*  the little symbol that they have on the car. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=401.52s)]
*  People who own those cars are now going to places to have the Tesla symbol removed and [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=403.4s)]
*  replaced with an Audi symbol or a Toyota symbol or something else because people are now embarrassed [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=408.28s)]
*  have buyers remorse over driving Teslas around. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=414.04s)]
*  That cannot be good for business, Mika. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=417.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's better than other things that have been happening. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=419.04s)]
*  Can we talk about his legions of children in the Wall Street Journal Exposé? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=422.76000000000005s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=426.48s)]
*  Please, that he's DMing women on Twitter and saying have my baby and giving them his sperm. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=427.48s)]
*  And then he told one of the women, this killed me, told one of the women that he expected [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=435.76s)]
*  her to have a C-section rather than a vaginal birth because that would impact the size of [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=440.84000000000003s)]
*  this child's brain. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=445.84000000000003s)]
*  This is a guy that not only is destroying his company, but more importantly, he is a [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=447.84000000000003s)]
*  weirdo. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=453.72s)]
*  He is a weirdo. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=454.72s)]
*  It's like a harem. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=455.72s)]
*  And the party of family values and moral majority, and he's got a harem and he wants to call [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=456.72s)]
*  all of his children a legion. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=463.52000000000004s)]
*  We don't even know how many kids he has. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=464.52000000000004s)]
*  That's my favorite part is that the reporting can't even bracket the reasonable range of [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=466.0s)]
*  how many progenies. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbt72ZfoyGU&t=473.24s)]
