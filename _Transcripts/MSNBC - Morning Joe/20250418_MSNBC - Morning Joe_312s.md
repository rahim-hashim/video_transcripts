# We can be doing more: House member calls for tougher laws after FSU shooting
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [April 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ)
*  to the conversation, Democratic Congressman Jared Moskowitz of Florida. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Congressman, I wonder if you can talk about the way that Democrats have responded to this. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=3.92s)]
*  We've seen a clamoring from the grassroots for more fight from your party. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=8.0s)]
*  Is what Senator Chris Van Hollen doing the right answer to that demand? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=12.48s)]
*  Well, thanks, Ali. Thanks for having me. I mean, so what the Senator's doing, obviously, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=18.0s)]
*  is that's his representative. So he's doing what he thinks is necessary [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=21.84s)]
*  on behalf of his constituents. As far as the Democrats are concerned, I agree with the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=25.52s)]
*  analysis of the previous panel, which is, look, the immigration debate is to the side. This is [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=29.44s)]
*  about a Supreme Court order. And so we can have a different discussion on immigration. And I, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=35.04s)]
*  you know, the Democratic Party is a big tent on that. But on this issue, it was a 9-0 ruling [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=40.72s)]
*  by the Supreme Court. You might not like the ruling. Lord knows there are Supreme Court rulings [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=45.6s)]
*  people don't like all the time. But you have to obey the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court said [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=50.24s)]
*  9-0, you got to bring him back. He's got to get due process. And so as we're dealing with immigration, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=55.44s)]
*  people have to get due process. That's clear. The court has said that. And the Trump administration [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  needs to listen to the Supreme Court. That's why this is getting a lot more traction. It's not just [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=65.75999999999999s)]
*  about one individual. It's all about whether the Trump administration is going to listen to the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=70.4s)]
*  Supreme Court. And they're not going to listen to the Supreme Court on this issue as a test case. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=75.44s)]
*  Then it's the question of how far are they willing to push? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=80.08s)]
*  Congresswoman, let's turn the conversation to the reason we had already booked you to have you on [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=82.39999999999999s)]
*  the program, which is to talk about gun control efforts and particularly what happened in Florida [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=88.24s)]
*  yesterday at Florida State University in Tallahassee. You've been working even before [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=93.83999999999999s)]
*  the tragic events of yesterday to try to push the White House to keep in place the White House [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=101.35999999999999s)]
*  Office of Gun Violence Prevention and all of the efforts that you've taken. You were, of course, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=106.96s)]
*  a student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, and you represent that district. You'd put in [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=111.6s)]
*  place efforts to try to enact gun prevention methods. But the things that you had done now [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=118.64s)]
*  seem to have disappeared from the roster of things that the White House is doing. Tell us [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=125.19999999999999s)]
*  what the situation is with the efforts that you had taken and what you're hoping to do to get those [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=130.0s)]
*  controls back in place. Well, obviously, there's two separate [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=135.68s)]
*  pieces to that. In D.C., in the last couple of years, we had worked with the Biden administration, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  and we got the Office of Gun Violence Safety, that was the Maxwell Frost bill that they then [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=146.96s)]
*  put into the White House. The reason that office was important is one of the things we saw when we [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=151.28s)]
*  had a mass shooting is that there was tremendous disorganization on the ground afterwards of all [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=156.24s)]
*  the resources, reunification centers. This office was going to help with the response. FEMA doesn't [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=163.12s)]
*  do this. So this was going to help bring government response together and have a unified [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=168.96s)]
*  command of all of these different local, state and federal resources. Fortunately, the Trump [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=173.84s)]
*  administration got rid of that. That was a tremendous mistake, because whether they support [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=179.12s)]
*  gun violence prevention, which they don't, this was an office that helped people. It helped families. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=184.88s)]
*  So we're trying to get that back in place. On the Florida standpoint, look, we have the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=190.4s)]
*  Marjory Stoneman Douglas School Safety Bill, which I passed in Florida in a Republican House, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=194.4s)]
*  a Republican Senate, and got Rick Scott to sign it. And that raised the age to 21 to buy a gun, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=199.12s)]
*  three-day waiting periods and red flag laws. By the way, those red flag laws have been used [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=204.08s)]
*  21,000 times in the last seven years. Law enforcement has been using those. In the case at FSU, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=207.76s)]
*  look, we have to get more details, but maybe a lot of these safe storage bills, which have [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=215.28s)]
*  stalled in years past, which are very popular, could have helped here. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=220.24s)]
*  I want to point out one thing, though. He was 20 years old. He had to take his mom's handgun, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=223.52s)]
*  because that was the only access to a weapon he had. Because of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=230.08s)]
*  School Safety Bill, he was unable to go to a gun store, buy two AR-15s, unlimited rounds of ammunition [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=234.56s)]
*  and body armor. Had he been able to do that, had the law in Florida not existed, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=241.44s)]
*  what we saw at FSU yesterday wouldn't be two people. It'd be 30. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=246.64000000000001s)]
*  And so while we weren't able to prevent what happened, the law that was in place in Florida [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=250.8s)]
*  mitigated what happened in tremendous capacity. But that doesn't mean we can't be doing more, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=255.76000000000002s)]
*  so that we don't have more families dealing with this. What I saw in Parkland seven years ago, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=261.36s)]
*  and what we have seen since then around the country, when you watch parents put their [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=267.12s)]
*  teenagers in a box, because all they did was send them to school or send them to a movie theater, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=272.16s)]
*  it is the worst thing you can ever imagine. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=278.08000000000004s)]
*  – Yeah. Democratic Congressman Jared Moskowitz in Florida, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=281.20000000000005s)]
*  so grateful for you being here. And also, thank you so much. The point Cady made. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In5HKUfJfUQ&t=285.92s)]
