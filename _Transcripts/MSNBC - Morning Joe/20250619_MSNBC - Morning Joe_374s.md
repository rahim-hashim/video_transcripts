# Israel reports 'direct hit' on hospital by Iranian missile
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ)
*  Let's bring in NBC News chief international correspondent Keir Simmons live from Erbil, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Iraq. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=6.8s)]
*  Keir, what are you hearing? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=7.8s)]
*  KEIR SIMMONS, NBC NEWS CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, IRBIL, IRAK, CURTAIN, IRGC, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=8.8s)]
*  IRGC, IRGC, IRBIL, IRRBIL, IRRBIL, IRRBIL, IRRBIL, IRRBIL, IRRBIL, IRRBIL, IRRBIL, IRRBIL, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=9.8s)]
*  IRRBIL, IRRBIL, IRRBIL, IRRBIL, IRRBIL, IRRBIL, IRRBIL, IRRBIL, IRRBIL, IRRBIL, IRRBIL, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=10.8s)]
*  IRRBIL. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=11.8s)]
*  We are just hearing that the Israeli defence minister has engaged in the debate again saying [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=12.8s)]
*  that a dictator like Khamenei cannot be allowed to continue on the question of regime change. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=18.12s)]
*  Of course, we are here in Iraq, where they know a thing or two about regime change and [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=25.04s)]
*  about how regime change is just the beginning, it's what comes afterwards that really counts. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=29.720000000000002s)]
*  Just in terms of the news, as you have been reporting, continued strikes both in Iran [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=35.88s)]
*  and in Israel. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=41.080000000000005s)]
*  That hospital in Beersheba, the Soraka hospital, that was hit. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=42.6s)]
*  The Iranians saying that they were targeting a military site across Israel. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  More than 65 have been injured in Iran. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=54.0s)]
*  The apparently no longer working heavy water reactor in Iraq, Iran, that has been hit. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=59.0s)]
*  Clearly the Israelis think that that may well have been part of Iran's nuclear programme. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=67.44s)]
*  But as I mentioned, we are here in Iraqi Kurdistan, in northern Iraq. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=74.4s)]
*  Let me just get our cameraman to pan over there to the base that is in the distance [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=79.56s)]
*  there. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=86.32s)]
*  This is the American base here in Erbil. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=87.6s)]
*  That is, of course, one of the targets that you have been talking about, that we worry [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=90.83999999999999s)]
*  about. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=94.91999999999999s)]
*  About 30 miles from here this morning, there were reports that an Iranian drone went down. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=95.91999999999999s)]
*  There were reports too of Iranian drones around the US bases in Syria. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=101.32s)]
*  But it is relatively calm here. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=106.35999999999999s)]
*  this again, this is the Kurdish region of Iraq, neighboring the Kurdish region of Iran, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=109.64s)]
*  and the messaging that you're hearing from the Israelis to the Iranian people to rise [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=118.48s)]
*  up, that in part will be directed at the Kurdish people. Here's one of the issues on that, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=123.56s)]
*  though, aside from the question of what happens after regime change, what happens if there [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  is some kind of a revolution, here's one of the issues. You guys all know the history [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=132.88s)]
*  here that in the past the Kurdish people have been encouraged to rise up under Saddam Hussein, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=137.74s)]
*  for example. For that, they were subject to gas attacks by Saddam Hussein that killed [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=143.3s)]
*  huge numbers of Kurds. There was uprising in Iran just a few years ago over the death [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=149.70000000000002s)]
*  of Massa Amini, the woman who was apprehended by the Iranians because of the clothes she [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=156.3s)]
*  was wearing. No one came in to help the Iranian people who stood up then, the Iranian women. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=162.42s)]
*  It's understandable that the message we are getting, we've just arrived here, is that [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=170.26s)]
*  if you want the Iranian people to rise up, you may need to do a little more than just [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=176.22s)]
*  talk. I guess that's what the Israelis are trying to do as well as hit the Iranian nuclear [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=180.89999999999998s)]
*  program. There are huge questions and I think doubts about whether that's really going to happen. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=189.14s)]
*  My gosh, when you talk about the Kurds, nobody, no group has been more used, more lied to, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=193.89999999999998s)]
*  more abandoned than the Kurds over the past 20, 30 years. Kier, we were obviously talking [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=200.7s)]
*  about the United States going into Iraq, one of the reasons that people who opposed that, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=206.85999999999999s)]
*  one of the few people who opposed it like Dr. Brzezinski, they talked about it was a [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=212.94s)]
*  Shia dominated country and that it would actually accrue to the benefit geopolitically of the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=219.82s)]
*  Iranians in the long run. I'm curious, here we are 22 years later, Iran's facing an existential [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=226.42s)]
*  crisis. How is the Shia majority in Iraq where you are right now responding to this conflict? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=234.66s)]
*  Have there been strong condemnations or are they sitting back like Syria and other Middle [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=242.86s)]
*  Eastern countries with muted responses? The Iraqi government is condemning the Israeli [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=247.82000000000002s)]
*  attacks on Iran. The Popular Mobilization Forces here in Iraq, who are the Shia pro-Iran [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=255.74s)]
*  militia, if you like, they are making noises. They're not doing very much at this stage. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=261.5s)]
*  Why I'll let you guys discuss why that might be, whether they're waiting to see what President [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=270.14s)]
*  Trump does, whether they are holding, for whatever reason, I'll let you guys dig into [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=275.02s)]
*  that. But I will say one other thing to Richard's point about those bunker busting bombs that [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=281.42s)]
*  might hit Fordow, the 30,000 pound American bombs. I think we're getting into a little [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=287.21999999999997s)]
*  shorthand on that now. The reality is that it's not absolutely clear that those bombs [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=291.82s)]
*  work in Fordow. They are the most powerful bombs able to go deep into the ground. But [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=298.34s)]
*  it doesn't necessarily do the job, if you like. It is a kind of Trump card to eradicate [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=305.02s)]
*  the Iranian nuclear programme and all is well. I think the story of Iraq and of intervention [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=313.5s)]
*  in Iraq here where we are now, that tells the story of how predictions of military intervention, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=320.17999999999995s)]
*  that they're just going to be a solution, don't necessarily play out that way. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG0pbry5ymQ&t=326.82s)]
