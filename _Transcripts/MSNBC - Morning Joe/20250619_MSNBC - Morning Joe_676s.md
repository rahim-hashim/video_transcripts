# 'Trump wants to side with who’s winning': How president may view handling Iran
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8)
*  All right, our top story this morning, Israel is vowing to intensify its attacks after an [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=0.0s)]
*  Iranian missile plunged into a southern Israeli hospital earlier today. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=5.66s)]
*  Jonathan? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=11.3s)]
*  Yeah, and back in Washington, President Trump is still considering his next steps as the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=12.3s)]
*  conflict overseas enters its seventh day. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=16.4s)]
*  We have got two reports for you now, starting with NBC News chief foreign correspondent, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  Richard Engel. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  Dozens of Iranian ballistic missiles rained down across Israel this morning. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=25.4s)]
*  Sirens wailed as Israeli air defense systems sprung into action. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=31.2s)]
*  But at least four of Iran's powerful missiles made it through. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=36.4s)]
*  The Soroka Hospital in Beersheba in southern Israel took a direct hit, according to Israeli [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=41.239999999999995s)]
*  officials. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=46.64s)]
*  The impact captured on a cell phone video. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=47.64s)]
*  Inside, staff and security moved to evacuate patients and search for injured, with sections [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=52.88s)]
*  of the ceiling on the floor. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=58.6s)]
*  Israel's defense minister called it a war crime, and Prime Minister Netanyahu saying, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=61.04s)]
*  we will exact the full price from the tyrants in Tehran. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=65.48s)]
*  There were no deaths reported, but several injured. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=69.64s)]
*  Iran said it was aiming for a military site near the hospital. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=72.8s)]
*  Another missile exploded in Ramat Gan outside Tel Aviv, hitting a business district, and [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  more buildings in nearby Holon. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=82.8s)]
*  Search and rescue teams arriving quickly. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=85.56s)]
*  We have five buildings that were hit by the missile. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=87.4s)]
*  We have one which is the main building and all the other ones surrounding it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=91.28s)]
*  Israel is continuing its strikes across Iran to pick apart the country's military, destroying [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=95.12s)]
*  these Iranian helicopters and missile launchers and nuclear sites. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=100.72s)]
*  But some nuclear facilities are buried so deeply, only American bunker busters can reach [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=106.48s)]
*  them. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=112.2s)]
*  Yuli Edelstein chairs the Israeli Parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=113.2s)]
*  Is the main issue this super bomb that the United States possesses? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=117.28s)]
*  Is that really the main capacity that the U.S. has that Israel would like to have? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=122.2s)]
*  In dry military terms, the answer would be yes. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=128.36s)]
*  We have the capacity with less effort to get rid of one of the Iranian nuclear sites. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=131.16s)]
*  We are not saying that we won't try to find our own ways to deal with that. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=139.44s)]
*  With the United States, it could be much easier and faster. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=146.16s)]
*  This morning, President Trump remains publicly undecided on whether to order the U.S. military [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=151.3s)]
*  to join Israel's bombardment of Iran. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=155.64s)]
*  I may do it, I may not do it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=158.16s)]
*  Telling reporters late Wednesday, he's made no final decision on U.S. strikes. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=159.96s)]
*  I'd like to make the final decision one second before it's due, you know, because things [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=164.12s)]
*  change, I mean, especially with war. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=168.16s)]
*  And explaining how he'll arrive at what may be a presidency-defining conclusion. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=170.68s)]
*  I don't want to get involved either, but I've been saying for 20 years, maybe longer, that [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=175.08s)]
*  Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  And I think they were a few weeks away from having one. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  But the United States' own intelligence agencies maintain that Iran has not made a decision [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=184.60000000000002s)]
*  to rush towards building an atomic bomb, according to the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=188.76s)]
*  Committee and a source with knowledge of the matter. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=193.12s)]
*  Overnight, Iran's Deputy Ford Minister responding to the prospect of an attack from the U.S. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=195.96s)]
*  We will do whatever necessary to protect our people and our interests. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=200.51999999999998s)]
*  We have no choice but to retaliate wherever we find the targets necessary to be acted [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=205.64s)]
*  upon. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=215.2s)]
*  Iran has likely already set back the country's nuclear program by a few months, according [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=218.64000000000001s)]
*  to two sources with knowledge of the matter. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=223.56s)]
*  The president huddling with advisers in the Situation Room for a second straight day and [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=226.04s)]
*  earlier suggesting to reporters he'd given Iran an ultimatum and that the window for [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=230.36s)]
*  a negotiated peace was closing. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=234.56s)]
*  Maybe you could call it the ultimate, the ultimate ultimatum, right? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=237.04000000000002s)]
*  And as the Pentagon moves a second and third aircraft carrier strike group towards the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=242.20000000000002s)]
*  region in response to the ongoing conflict, lawmakers deeply divided on the wisdom of [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=246.32s)]
*  actively joining Israel's attacks on Iran in any capacity, a decision they can influence, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=250.95999999999998s)]
*  but only the president will make. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=256.48s)]
*  The American people did not vote last November to be dragged into one more endless war in [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=258.04s)]
*  the Middle East. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=265.48s)]
*  So, either you want them to have a nuclear weapon or you don't. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=266.48s)]
*  And if you don't, if diplomacy fails, you use force. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=270.2s)]
*  NBC News senior White House correspondent, Garrett Haake, with that report. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=276.2s)]
*  Joining us now, politics bureau chief and senior political columnist at Politico, Jonathan [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=280.64s)]
*  Martin and political strategist and former adviser to Senator John McCain and President [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=285.16s)]
*  George W. Bush, Mark McKinnon. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=290.56s)]
*  And Mark, you're looking at the sort of emerging dynamic between President Trump and Netanyahu. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=293.24s)]
*  What are you seeing? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=301.48s)]
*  I think that Netanyahu is driving him like a truck. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=303.15999999999997s)]
*  I think this notion of Donald Trump peacenik is just a myth. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=306.4s)]
*  That was a politically expedient position that he took to get elected. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=311.28s)]
*  But I think the core of who Donald Trump is, is all about aggression, offense, I mean, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=314.88s)]
*  military parades. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=319.71999999999997s)]
*  That's why he supports authoritarians. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=320.71999999999997s)]
*  That's why he likes Bibi. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=322.44s)]
*  And also he likes to win. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=324.0s)]
*  I think he thinks that right now the offensive that Israel has taken has been largely successful. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=325.12s)]
*  And he wants some credit for that. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=330.96s)]
*  And he doesn't want to be the guy at the end of the game who didn't pull the trigger and [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=332.36s)]
*  there were consequences. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=336.0s)]
*  But so the problem is that if he does pull the trigger, what you have is what Ben Rhodes, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=338.12s)]
*  Obama's guy, called potentially catastrophic success, which is you take it out, but then [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=343.04s)]
*  what? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=348.04s)]
*  Well, and that's certainly something that both Bush 41 and Bush 43 had. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=349.04s)]
*  They had catastrophic success. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=356.8s)]
*  They had approval ratings going up in the 80s and the 90s. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=358.68s)]
*  I know you do. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=362.12s)]
*  And then it ended very badly for both of them. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=363.84s)]
*  So you can have catastrophic, catastrophic successes there. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=367.03999999999996s)]
*  You know, Jay, one of the reasons I find this to be such a fascinating, obviously an existential [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=373.56s)]
*  question for the president answer, but just so fascinating given this president is we [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=381.12s)]
*  have two separate. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=386.2s)]
*  We really have two separate competing interests, and it's hard to tell which one's going to [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=387.44s)]
*  win out. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=391.12s)]
*  One side, you do have the possibility, the possibility of severely damaging Iran's capability [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=392.12s)]
*  of creating a nuclear weapon. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=398.15999999999997s)]
*  And the president said no nukes for Iran. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=399.91999999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=402.35999999999996s)]
*  The other side of it, though, you have a president who has been contemptuous of forever wars [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=403.35999999999996s)]
*  in the Middle East for the past 25 years, who who has mocked and ridiculed George W. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=408.35999999999996s)]
*  Bush, Liz Cheney and others who support those forever wars that not only yes, not only Elizabeth [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=416.12s)]
*  Warren was talking about, but also most Americans would be talking about too. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=424.84s)]
*  They do they do not want to be involved in another endless war in the Middle East. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=429.56s)]
*  So where does a president come down here? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=434.68s)]
*  What are you hearing? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=437.15999999999997s)]
*  You put your finger on it, Joe. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=438.84s)]
*  I think I think there's been a lot of strong talk, but not much action just yet. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=440.4s)]
*  I think he likes the idea of rattling sabers. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=445.92s)]
*  I think he's OK with air power. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=448.52s)]
*  Certainly did that in the first term. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=450.96s)]
*  I think he's deeply uneasy about any possibility of boots on the ground. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=452.76s)]
*  So I think if he's convinced that you can do this through the air, you never have to [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=457.92s)]
*  commit U.S. troops. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=461.96s)]
*  Maybe he's open to it. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=463.24s)]
*  But, Joe, you are precisely on target here that Trump ran against two people. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=464.36s)]
*  He ran against the Bush family and he ran against Obama and the Clintons. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=472.0s)]
*  And so that gets to the heart of his dilemma now is that he doesn't like either approach. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=476.79999999999995s)]
*  I think he wants to be more of a tough guy. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=483.0s)]
*  He doesn't want to be a sort of peacenek type. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=485.12s)]
*  And and so he doesn't want to be grouped as, oh, oh, you're going to make the same mistake [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=487.12s)]
*  that Biden did in Afghanistan. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=491.79999999999995s)]
*  You're going to give the Iranians the kind of deal that Obama did. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=494.0s)]
*  He doesn't like that sort of grouping. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=498.44s)]
*  But he sure as hell also doesn't like being compared to the forever wars of the 2000s, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=500.48s)]
*  Afghanistan and Iraq. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=506.8s)]
*  I think that gets to the heart of this tension here that he Trump is against both of those [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=508.28s)]
*  political forces, the Obama crowd and the Bush crowd. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=513.72s)]
*  And so I think that's why you can't really decide. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=517.28s)]
*  But Mark put his finger on it, too. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=519.32s)]
*  Trump wants ultimately to be on the side of who's winning. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=521.44s)]
*  Right. Trump wants to side with who's winning. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=524.48s)]
*  And right now, the Israelis have shown great success. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=527.08s)]
*  You guys know this. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=530.28s)]
*  If that attack hadn't gone well on night one in Tehran, Trump would never be with Bibi [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=531.6s)]
*  and the Israelis right now. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=536.72s)]
*  Trump is a front runner. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=537.9599999999999s)]
*  He wants to be with the guys who are ahead. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=539.16s)]
*  And right now, the Israelis are winning. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=540.76s)]
*  Yeah, there's no question of that. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=542.6s)]
*  And I think that to this point, per my reporting, there's been no conversation about American [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=545.0s)]
*  boots on the ground. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=549.68s)]
*  It would simply be an airstrike, at least for now. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=550.48s)]
*  And there's some reporting this morning from both Axios and the Guardian suggesting there [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=552.6s)]
*  are some doubts whether the Bunker Buster bomb actually would completely take out this [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=557.24s)]
*  facility that is buried so deep in that mountain. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=560.76s)]
*  What we do know for sure is this bomb never been tested before in action, never been used [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=562.92s)]
*  in combat before. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=567.0s)]
*  So there's things about it we simply don't know. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=568.52s)]
*  So Mark, we're talking about the dilemma that the president is facing. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=571.16s)]
*  He does. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=574.44s)]
*  One day he says one thing, one day the next. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=575.44s)]
*  Some of that I think is intentional. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=576.8s)]
*  Some of that reflects he's honestly not sure what to do. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=578.3s)]
*  We're also seeing that divide in his base. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=580.24s)]
*  We've been talking all morning about how this is splintering MAGA. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=582.52s)]
*  The Tucker Carlson, Ted Cruz interview sort of encapsulates that. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=585.36s)]
*  But talk to us about what you're seeing, about how this is really forcing those in the America [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=589.2s)]
*  First camp to take sides. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=595.52s)]
*  Oh, yeah, no question. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=596.92s)]
*  I mean, this is an issue where Steve Bannon and Tucker Carlson really have their fingers [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=598.12s)]
*  on the pulse of the base, and they are truly isolationist. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=602.3000000000001s)]
*  So this is a huge cleave. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=606.0600000000001s)]
*  And it's interesting, it's not only a divide within MAGA, but it's also a divide within [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=608.48s)]
*  the administration. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=613.0s)]
*  Trump sidelined his director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, because she came out with a [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=614.72s)]
*  report saying she doesn't think that the intelligence shows that they are prepared, that they do [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=619.08s)]
*  have nuclear preparation. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=623.62s)]
*  So there's a divide in the base, there's a divide in the administration. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=624.98s)]
*  So this is really going to be one of the most consequential decisions of Trump's presidency, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=628.08s)]
*  both of them, I think. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=631.96s)]
*  And there's a divide in the Republican Party, and there really has been, especially since [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=634.76s)]
*  we first came in as a freshman class in 1994. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=640.2s)]
*  You guys will remember this. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=644.16s)]
*  We were populists, we were conservatives slash populists, and were very reluctant about going [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=645.52s)]
*  to war. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=655.0s)]
*  And we saw that. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h9ELtFS_m8&t=656.0s)]
