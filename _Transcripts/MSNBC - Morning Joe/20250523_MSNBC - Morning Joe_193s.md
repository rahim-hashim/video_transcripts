# Harvard sues the Trump administration over move to block foreign student enrollment
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyuU3FbE5U)
*  We want to turn now to an update on a story we brought you earlier this morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyuU3FbE5U&t=0.0s)]
*  In a new development, Harvard University has now sued the Trump administration after the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyuU3FbE5U&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Department of Justice had announced in a letter that it is pulling the school's exchange [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyuU3FbE5U&t=9.32s)]
*  visitor program certification. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyuU3FbE5U&t=14.72s)]
*  The DOJ says Harvard has created an unsafe campus environment that is, quote, hostile [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyuU3FbE5U&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  to Jewish students, promotes pro-Hamas sympathies, and employs racist diversity, equity, and [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyuU3FbE5U&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  inclusion policies. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyuU3FbE5U&t=28.16s)]
*  In its lawsuit, Harvard claims the Trump administration's move is a blatant violation of the U.S. Constitution [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyuU3FbE5U&t=30.48s)]
*  and other federal laws, and that it will have an immediate and devastating effect on the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyuU3FbE5U&t=36.96s)]
*  university. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyuU3FbE5U&t=42.239999999999995s)]
*  The university has nearly 7,000 international students, which make up about 27 percent of [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyuU3FbE5U&t=43.44s)]
*  the entire student body. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyuU3FbE5U&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  And Andrew, we've talked to you several times in recent months about Trump and his administration's [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyuU3FbE5U&t=51.2s)]
*  sort of war on higher education. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyuU3FbE5U&t=57.12s)]
*  This is a new front singling out Harvard for now, but others could certainly come. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyuU3FbE5U&t=60.08s)]
*  But the consequences of this are immense, not just for this university. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyuU3FbE5U&t=65.28s)]
*  And look, maybe its legal challenge will prove Harvard will win this. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyuU3FbE5U&t=69.96s)]
*  But the precedent set here also speaks to not just an enrichment of a campus, but a [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyuU3FbE5U&t=73.34s)]
*  brain drain for American universities and business and beyond. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyuU3FbE5U&t=79.28s)]
*  I think there's so many elements to this. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyuU3FbE5U&t=84.16s)]
*  First, it's obviously an escalation of the pressure against Harvard, but it really is [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyuU3FbE5U&t=86.04s)]
*  a shot across the bow at every university in terms of how they are going to behave, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyuU3FbE5U&t=90.16s)]
*  at least while this administration is in office. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyuU3FbE5U&t=95.0s)]
*  I think that's what this is meant to do even more than anything, recognizing that I think [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyuU3FbE5U&t=98.52s)]
*  when you talk to most lawyers, it may take years in court, but that Harvard may very [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyuU3FbE5U&t=103.08s)]
*  well prevail, or at least has a good case in this regard. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyuU3FbE5U&t=109.0s)]
*  There's also an interesting, though, economic element to this, which is that it's the foreign [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyuU3FbE5U&t=112.64s)]
*  students at Harvard, and frankly at most private institutions in America, that pay full freight, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyuU3FbE5U&t=117.48s)]
*  that ultimately actually subsidize the other students at the university. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyuU3FbE5U&t=123.04s)]
*  So there's an interesting sort of follow the money story that we're going to have to see [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyuU3FbE5U&t=128.04s)]
*  play out here. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyuU3FbE5U&t=132.16s)]
*  And I think the last piece is what you reflected, which is just this idea that Harvard has graduated [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyuU3FbE5U&t=133.4s)]
*  so many successful alumni around the world, but so many international students who have [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyuU3FbE5U&t=139.22s)]
*  come to Harvard, many of whom ultimately ended up in parts of American business and other [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyuU3FbE5U&t=145.78s)]
*  enterprise that have helped this country or have gone back to their countries and helped [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyuU3FbE5U&t=150.62s)]
*  and in many cases helped when it comes to democracy and so many of the other things [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyuU3FbE5U&t=155.3s)]
*  that this country has tried to advocate for. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyuU3FbE5U&t=160.02s)]
*  So there's so many different angles to this story this morning. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyuU3FbE5U&t=161.98s)]
*  Yeah, very well said there. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyuU3FbE5U&t=165.54s)]
*  Covering a lot of ground for us today. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyuU3FbE5U&t=167.1s)]
*  CNBC's Andrew Ossorke. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyuU3FbE5U&t=168.58s)]
*  Andrew, thank you as always. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyuU3FbE5U&t=169.82000000000002s)]
*  Have a great week. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyuU3FbE5U&t=171.5s)]
*  Dave Weigel, let's... [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKyuU3FbE5U&t=172.5s)]
