# Two-week warning: Trump buys time on potential U.S. strikes against Iran
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA)
*  Regarding the ongoing situation in Iran, I know there has been a lot of speculation [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=0.0s)]
*  amongst all of you in the media regarding the president's decision-making and whether [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=4.4s)]
*  or not the United States will be directly involved. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=8.48s)]
*  In light of that news, I have a message directly from the president, and I quote, based on [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=11.4s)]
*  the fact that there's a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=16.56s)]
*  with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=21.44s)]
*  next two weeks. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=26.740000000000002s)]
*  That's a quote directly from the president for all of you today. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=28.38s)]
*  White House Press Secretary Caroline Levitt yesterday announcing the president will decide [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=32.54s)]
*  within two weeks if the U.S. will directly attack Iran. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=37.14s)]
*  We're going to bring you the latest on the conflict in the Middle East, which has now [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=41.1s)]
*  reached its second week. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=45.22s)]
*  Also ahead, an appeals court is allowing the president to maintain control over the California [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=46.980000000000004s)]
*  National Guard. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=52.72s)]
*  We're going to dig into that decision, as well as the ruling from a different court [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=53.94s)]
*  against the administration on another issue tied to immigration. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=58.54s)]
*  Also ahead, the New Jersey homecoming yesterday for the last living American hostage in Gaza, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=63.94s)]
*  who was freed last month. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=82.86s)]
*  We'll have more of that ahead on this Friday morning. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=84.17999999999999s)]
*  Good morning and welcome to Morning Joe. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=86.98s)]
*  It is Friday, June 20th. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=89.42s)]
*  With us, we have managing editor at The Bullwork, Sam Stein. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=91.74s)]
*  Colonist and associate editor for The Washington Post, David Ignatius. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=95.7s)]
*  Back with us again, writer at large for The New York Times, Elizabeth Buhmiller, and former [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=99.38s)]
*  chief of staff at the CIA and Department of Defense, Jeremy Basch is with us this morning. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=104.14s)]
*  Good to have you all. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=110.02s)]
*  David Ignatius. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=111.17999999999999s)]
*  Two weeks. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=112.17999999999999s)]
*  Two weeks. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=113.17999999999999s)]
*  Where have I heard that before? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=114.17999999999999s)]
*  I mean, it actually is. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=117.17999999999999s)]
*  It is Donald Trump's standard unit of time for telling you... [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=120.17999999999999s)]
*  To make a decision. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=125.22s)]
*  When his healthcare proposal is coming out, when he's going to hold Vladimir Putin accountable, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=126.22s)]
*  and if you're Bibi Netanyahu, you have to be worried that he says the decision is going [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=131.98s)]
*  to be made in two weeks. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=136.78s)]
*  And yet, if you're Iran, you don't really trust that, do you? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=139.58s)]
*  I mean, he still has the mole's guessing going, well, is he just trying to lull us into a [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=144.58s)]
*  false sense of security here? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=151.38000000000002s)]
*  Is a strike coming? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=153.3s)]
*  Or is this Donald Trump kicking the can down the road? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=154.66000000000003s)]
*  So Joe, you're right. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=158.70000000000002s)]
*  Two weeks is the standard increment of Trump time. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=160.34s)]
*  But what happened yesterday was that Trump stepped back very clearly from his threat [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=164.06s)]
*  to bomb the Iranian enrichment facility at Fordow, and he did give diplomacy two weeks [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=170.06s)]
*  to operate. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=176.62s)]
*  I'm told by knowledgeable officials the following. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=177.9s)]
*  First, negotiation has been Trump's preference from the beginning. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=182.57999999999998s)]
*  That is how he wanted to get out of this crisis, going back months to when he first discussed [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=186.98s)]
*  with Prime Minister Netanyahu in February what was ahead. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=192.82s)]
*  Second, indirect contacts between the United States and Iran and direct contacts have continued [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=196.85999999999999s)]
*  through this period of tension. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=203.66s)]
*  Messages have been exchanged, and I'm told that the Iranian position has softened slightly [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=206.29999999999998s)]
*  on some issues, which makes Trump think that being tough and threatening bombing had some [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=212.85999999999999s)]
*  effect. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=217.89999999999998s)]
*  So we're now heading into a period where the positions still have some fundamental [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=219.86s)]
*  disagreements. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=224.94000000000003s)]
*  How you finesse the Iranian insistence that they have a right to enrich uranium with the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=226.22000000000003s)]
*  American insistence that any pathway to a nuclear weapon must be stopped is going to [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=233.14000000000001s)]
*  be hard to resolve, but not impossible. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=239.54000000000002s)]
*  When you look at the history of diplomatic negotiations, this is the kind of problem [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=241.18s)]
*  that smart diplomats can solve in ways that allow an outcome. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=246.45999999999998s)]
*  So I think these two weeks will be crucial. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=251.42s)]
*  I would note one final thing. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=254.66s)]
*  The extra time gives both Israelis and Americans more time to prepare military options, both [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=256.42s)]
*  the bunker buster, busting bomb, but also covert military operations on the ground that [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=262.78s)]
*  would achieve the same goal. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=268.98s)]
*  So this is a final thought. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=270.54s)]
*  The Iranians have not trusted Trump to deliver. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=273.22s)]
*  That's one reason these negotiations have not succeeded. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=276.98s)]
*  Somehow, if Trump wants to succeed, he's got to build more trust than he has now, assuming [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=279.66s)]
*  the Supreme Leader remains alive. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=285.76000000000005s)]
*  That's another wild card. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=287.98s)]
*  If he should be killed in this period, I think that's the end of negotiations. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=288.98s)]
*  But with a little more trust and a serious effort by Trump, for the first time you can [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=294.78000000000003s)]
*  see the outlines of a deal might be possible. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=301.18s)]
*  Elizabeth, the Wall Street Journal editorial page this morning goes after MAGA isolationists, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=304.26000000000005s)]
*  talking about how the real war has been the war that Iran has waged on America and the [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=310.54s)]
*  West since 1979. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=316.18s)]
*  But there is a part of it where they suggest that these isolationists are so shattered [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=318.58s)]
*  by the experiences of Vietnam and Iraq that they fear every war is going to be a forever [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=327.65999999999997s)]
*  war. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=334.21999999999997s)]
*  Well, you know, the Wall Street Journal editorial page, the overwhelming number of senators, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=335.21999999999997s)]
*  certain late night talk show hosts on MSNBC all supported the Iraq invasion and all said [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=342.54s)]
*  it looked like a cakewalk two or three weeks in. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=349.74s)]
*  It would seem to me, as you were writing, anybody who is not chastened by the lessons [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=352.34000000000003s)]
*  of our arrogance going into Vietnam and Iraq would be foolish. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=358.62s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=365.5s)]
*  What is really interesting right now is how much this feels in many ways like the run-up [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=366.5s)]
*  to the war in Iraq in Washington. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=372.02s)]
*  There's a huge difference, of course. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=374.53999999999996s)]
*  There's not more than 200,000 troops en masse in the Middle East ready to invade, ready [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=375.85999999999996s)]
*  to cross the border and march toward Baghdad. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=380.14s)]
*  But there are the same people, the same neoconservatives now calling for an attack on Fordo. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=383.14s)]
*  They are the same people saying that this can be done very quickly and easily. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=391.7s)]
*  divide again with Trump's base and in the country because, as we all remember, we were [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=397.58s)]
*  told it was going to be a cakewalk going into Iraq. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=403.9s)]
*  We were told that the U.S. troops would be treated as liberators. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=406.58s)]
*  And there was an initial euphoria after a three-week victory, and then we know what [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=411.82s)]
*  happened for the next close to nine years. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=417.09999999999997s)]
*  So it feels very similar. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=419.78s)]
*  And as we all know, Donald Trump campaigned three times as the president. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=421.54s)]
*  He was going to end our forever wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=426.94s)]
*  And I think what he's doing right now is what we call coercive diplomacy. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=430.1s)]
*  He has raged and threatened for several weeks now, threatened to assassinate the supreme [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=437.86s)]
*  leader, hoping that this would scare Iran into more negotiations. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=442.42s)]
*  And coercive diplomacy may work. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=449.38s)]
*  I know there are a lot of people who would prefer the coercive diplomacy to an attack. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=452.58s)]
*  I do want to go back to the Wall Street Journal editorial page. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=459.1s)]
*  There are a lot of things in this editorial that I agree with. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=461.34s)]
*  But one line did stand out, David Ignatius. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=466.02s)]
*  Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini insisted Mr. Trump's terms on Wednesday. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=470.94s)]
*  Resisted. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=475.9s)]
*  Resisted and said any U.S. military intervention will undoubtedly cause irreparable harm to [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=476.9s)]
*  them. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=481.7s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal editorial page says, this recycles his threat from before Israel's [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=482.78s)]
*  attacks. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=488.06s)]
*  And this is what they say, but it isn't clear that he can make good on it. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=489.14s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=493.62s)]
*  I mean, that sentence does a lot. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=494.62s)]
*  We've all talked about how even a crippled Iranian government could spread chaos and [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=498.34s)]
*  health throughout the world, especially when it's directed at U.S. interests, whether it's [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=505.7s)]
*  embassies in Africa, embassies in the Far East, wherever those embassies are, they still [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=510.7s)]
*  could cause grave damage to the United States, could they not? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=517.82s)]
*  So their ability to damage the global economy in particular is something that you have to [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=523.02s)]
*  take seriously. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=529.0600000000001s)]
*  The one thing that U.S. military planners have worried a lot about in recent weeks is [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiVQ9Kf_PhA&t=531.5s)]
