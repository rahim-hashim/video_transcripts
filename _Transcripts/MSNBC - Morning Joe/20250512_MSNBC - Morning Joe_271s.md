# 'Not business as usual': Senator on Trump's planned Middle East trip
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM)
*  Joining us now is Democratic member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=0.0s)]
*  Chris Murphy of Connecticut Senate. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=5.4s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us as well, listening to what Kim was saying. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=7.76s)]
*  The delicate moment at which the President Trump is going into the Middle East, what [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=12.08s)]
*  do you think the chances are of something coming out of this that looks like a political [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=18.44s)]
*  detente if you like around Iran as opposed to just business, which is what the President [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=24.32s)]
*  has said he's going there for? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=29.76s)]
*  Can we get some politics out of this too? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=31.2s)]
*  Well, let's be clear about what this trip is all about. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=34.0s)]
*  This is President Trump's corruption tour of the Middle East. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=38.16s)]
*  He is going to the Gulf in order to collect tribute. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=41.56s)]
*  What's happening here is an extraordinary level of corruption. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=46.04s)]
*  We shouldn't pretend this is business as usual. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=49.54s)]
*  What the President is doing is giving countries like Saudi Arabia and UAE what they want. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=51.68s)]
*  For Saudi Arabia, it's a civilian nuclear deal with the United States. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=57.44s)]
*  For the UAE, it is taking some of the restrictions off of the way that semiconductors flow into [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=61.52s)]
*  that country. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=67.44s)]
*  And in exchange, Trump is not asking for any benefit to the American people. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=68.44s)]
*  He's not asking for any movement towards peace in the region. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=72.76s)]
*  He's asking for cash. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=76.16s)]
*  He's asking for cash payments. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=78.48s)]
*  UAE is giving him that through this deal on cryptocurrency in which they are paying, doing [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=79.96s)]
*  a big deal through Trump Crypto. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=85.96s)]
*  And of course, we just found out this weekend that Qatar is going to be giving Donald Trump [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=89.24s)]
*  a plane, apparently personally. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=93.32s)]
*  So that's the story of this trip. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=95.91999999999999s)]
*  On Iran, I mean, listen, obviously, I want a diplomatic agreement with Iran. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=98.47999999999999s)]
*  What tragedy it would be if the result of these negotiations is to move Iran from where [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=104.67999999999999s)]
*  it is today, a handful of weeks away from a nuclear weapon if it wanted one, to a year, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=110.24s)]
*  which is what the stated objective is. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=115.32s)]
*  That was the deal that President Obama had negotiated, that Donald Trump walked away [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=117.91999999999999s)]
*  from. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=122.16s)]
*  We wouldn't have to be at the negotiating table today talking about extending the time [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=123.16s)]
*  frame for an Iranian nuclear weapon out to a year if Donald Trump hadn't thrown that [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=127.08s)]
*  agreement in the trash. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=131.04s)]
*  So it's just a sign of both the corruption and the incompetence of this administration's [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=132.48s)]
*  foreign policy. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=136.48s)]
*  Senator, the situation in Gaza is grim and getting grimmer every day for the people who [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=137.48s)]
*  live there. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=142.67999999999998s)]
*  The chances of any kind of deal over Gaza seem to have just disappeared from not just [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=143.67999999999998s)]
*  the headlines but serious negotiations as well at the moment. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=149.0s)]
*  It does look like we're going to get the last remaining Israeli-American being held hostage [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=151.67999999999998s)]
*  out. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=156.83999999999997s)]
*  Do you feel that this administration has now just washed its hands of the Gaza situation? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=159.0s)]
*  Having produced, we saw that extraordinary video of Gaza being the kind of Trump Riviera [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=163.28s)]
*  of the Middle East. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=168.92s)]
*  There was an extraordinary moment right at the transition where you had both the outgoing [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=172.52s)]
*  Biden administration and the incoming Trump administration working to produce a ceasefire [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=177.56s)]
*  and a deal to release hostages. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=182.24s)]
*  Since then, Donald Trump has done nothing meaningful to put pressure on the Israeli [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=184.8s)]
*  government or nothing really meaningful to put pressure on Hamas in order to bring not [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=189.16s)]
*  only a permanent ceasefire but a move towards a political settlement. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=195.36s)]
*  What Bibi Netanyahu is contemplating doing right now is re-entering this war, ultimately [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=199.4s)]
*  for the purpose of essentially eradicating from big parts of Gaza the Palestinian people. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=205.56s)]
*  That will guarantee a long-term insurgency. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=212.1s)]
*  That will hurt the long-term security of Israel and likely the United States as well. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=215.22s)]
*  This next step that it now is contemplating taking, essentially restarting the war, it [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=221.02s)]
*  has real consequences for the United States. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=226.5s)]
*  It's a moment where this trip should include some real diplomacy on Gaza, but because Trump [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=229.1s)]
*  is only focusing on padding his own pockets, he's not going to Israel. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  He's only going to the countries that are willing to pay him off. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=238.66s)]
*  And we will see when that hostage gets out. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=241.57999999999998s)]
*  We'll bring you that news as well. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=244.1s)]
*  Democratic member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=245.1s)]
*  thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3mwO-AJ_cM&t=249.42s)]
