# Wealth of America's billionaires has doubled over past eight years, says author
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY)
*  Welcome back. According to the Congressional Budget Office report last year, the top 10 [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=0.0s)]
*  percent of richest Americans control 60 percent of the nation's wealth, while the bottom half [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=5.68s)]
*  control only 6 percent. The gap grows even wider. When you take Social Security out of [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=11.4s)]
*  the equation, the bottom 50 percent of Americans control only 3 percent of the country's riches, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=17.72s)]
*  while the top 10 percent control 70 percent of the nation's wealth. Joining us now, staff [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=26.32s)]
*  writer for The New Yorker and New York Times bestselling author Evan Osnos. His new book [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  entitled The Haves and the Have Yachts, Dispatches on the Ultra-Rich. Evan, thanks so much for [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=36.66s)]
*  being with us. Talk obviously about just the extraordinary wealth gap between the haves [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=43.92s)]
*  and the have-nots, but also talk about the timing of it and the trends of it. When did [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=52.8s)]
*  we wake up to this new reality? Yeah, it's no accident that we're talking about it now, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=57.08s)]
*  Joe. I mean, over the last eight years since Donald Trump's first inauguration and his [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=61.559999999999995s)]
*  second inauguration, the wealth of America's billionaires more than doubled, and that's [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=65.67999999999999s)]
*  part of a larger trend. In fact, if you go back to 1990, there were only 66 billionaires [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=70.88s)]
*  in this country. There now are more than 800, which you might say, okay, maybe that's a [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=74.94s)]
*  sign of prosperity, except that the median hourly wage in this country has only gone [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=79.12s)]
*  up about 20 percent in that time. I think there is a feeling in the air, and this is [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=82.80000000000001s)]
*  made acute by the politics we see in Washington and the kind of administration we have, an [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=87.66000000000001s)]
*  administration in which the president named 13 billionaires to the highest ranks of his [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=93.04s)]
*  administration, that it feels as if the rich have pulled farther ahead than ever before, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=96.88000000000001s)]
*  and that's not an illusion. Right now, America's richest people hold a larger share of America's [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=102.02000000000001s)]
*  wealth than even the Vanderbilts, the Carnegie's, and the Rockefellers did in the heyday of [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=107.5s)]
*  their prime a century ago. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=112.66s)]
*  So, Evan, also talk about bigger forces, and if you go from the agrarian age to the industrial [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=116.26s)]
*  age, which created all of those gilded age millionaires, billionaires, and then to the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=126.3s)]
*  information age, to the tech age, and now we're going to the AI age, talk about how [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=134.3s)]
*  that accelerates wealth and accelerates, again, the consolidation of wealth for billionaires. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=141.78s)]
*  You're absolutely right. I mean, the analogy that I drew at the beginning, the new gilded [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=150.14000000000001s)]
*  age, is a reference to this important moment in the 19th century. Remember that term, the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=153.14000000000001s)]
*  gilded age, came to us from Mark Twain. When he was growing up, there were only a handful [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=157.94s)]
*  of millionaires in the country by 1873 when he named it the gilded age, this very durable [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=162.38s)]
*  term which still resonates with us today. It was because it was a time of new technology. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=168.38s)]
*  You had the advent of the telephone and all kinds of the elevator, all kinds of new ways [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=172.94s)]
*  of innovating, but the gains were consolidating into fewer and fewer hands. What happened [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=177.08s)]
*  was that gave birth to a new awareness, a kind of an awareness of the fact that this [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=183.9s)]
*  was ultimately unsustainable. That's how you had this passage from the gilded age to [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=189.62s)]
*  what was known as the progressive era, people like Teddy Roosevelt and ultimately FDR who [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=194.58s)]
*  stood up and said, look, if we want to protect this system, maintain public confidence in [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=199.3s)]
*  capitalism, maintain democracy, we're going to have to make reforms. There's a great and [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=203.5s)]
*  memorable line by Louis Brandeis, who was a Supreme Court justice who said, we can either [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=207.54000000000002s)]
*  have democracy or we can have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can't have both. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=211.9s)]
*  So in the book you explain why yachts are the preferred avenue of the uber wealthy to [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=218.9s)]
*  show off their fortunes and you write in part this, if it's more than 90 feet, it's a super [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=224.34s)]
*  yacht. After that definitions are debated, but people generally agree that anything more [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=229.86s)]
*  than 230 feet is a mega yacht and more than 295 feet is a giga yacht. The world contains [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=234.66s)]
*  about 5,400 super yachts and about 100 giga yachts. Even among the truly rich, there is [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=245.24s)]
*  a gap between the haves and the have yachts. One boating guest told me about a conversation [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=253.52s)]
*  with a famous friend who keeps one of the world's largest yachts. He said the boat is [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=259.22s)]
*  the last vestige of what real wealth can do. What he meant is you have a chef and I have [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=263.56s)]
*  a driver, I have a driver. You can fly privately, I can fly privately. So the one place where [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=270.84s)]
*  I can make clear to the world that I am in a different, you know what category than you [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=277.23999999999995s)]
*  is the boat. Let's go right now to a man who owns a 1974 16 foot Boston Whale. Whaler, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=284.28s)]
*  yeah. Go ahead Mike with the next question. You know I have to tell you Joe, I am not [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=292.0s)]
*  a boat guy. I don't even like to go out on the ocean in boats. As long as I can see land, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=296.36s)]
*  I will be on a boat but that's about it. But Evan, a piece of the book is excerpted in the New [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=300.84000000000003s)]
*  Yorker magazine that's out now and it's largely to do with Washington and the White House. And I [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=307.0s)]
*  was reading it yesterday and the numbers astounded me. Five million dollars gets you an invite from [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=313.32s)]
*  President Trump to see him or talk to him or whatever. How did we get here? You know we've [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=320.16s)]
*  always had pay to play of some kind Mike and what is really remarkable, what really sort of deserved [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=326.08000000000004s)]
*  mention in the New Yorker this week was that this is a staggering level of transaction of influence [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=331.44s)]
*  for money that is really surprising even the seasoned practitioners. As you say MAGA Inc. which [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=337.92s)]
*  is a super PAC is now offering one-on-one conversations with the president for five [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=343.6s)]
*  million dollars but as a government affairs executive said to me, he said we don't know [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=347.36s)]
*  ultimately where that money ends up. What if he's in a bad mood? Look I think if you ask any American [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=351.52000000000004s)]
*  whether they like Donald Trump or they don't like Donald Trump, that's not how they imagine politics [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=356.40000000000003s)]
*  is supposed to be serving in their interest. That's not how you reflect the will of the average [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=361.04s)]
*  citizen in the affairs of government which are so important to us every day. A quick follow-up to [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=366.16s)]
*  that, I mean that's obviously would seem like a potent political argument. We've heard Bernie [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=370.08000000000004s)]
*  Sanders say it for years now. Is that something with with it's so brazen right now what you just [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=373.12s)]
*  described with Trump? Do you think this is are we at a tipping point like where this could now swing [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=378.48s)]
*  back the other way? Yeah I think Jonathan you know that in some sense the backlash against Elon Musk [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=383.12s)]
*  is very telling. Even in the heyday of the Vanderbilts and the Carnegie's they never had an office [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=387.6s)]
*  in the White House complex. They never had a department of government with the ability to [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=392.8s)]
*  hire and fire tens of thousands of workers including in agencies that do business with [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=396.72s)]
*  their own companies. There is a level on which that kind of collapse of the barrier between [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=401.12s)]
*  private business and government and the interests of the richest man in the world and the president [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=406.64s)]
*  that just offended people on a visceral level and you saw it 71 drop in the profits at Tesla [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=411.6s)]
*  his favorability collapsed. There is a way in which Americans fundamentally want to get rich. Look this [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=418.0s)]
*  is baked into us always have always will but there is a point at which people begin to say [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=423.92s)]
*  are there people and are there systems are there rules that are standing in the way of me getting [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=429.92s)]
*  rich? Is it because in fact too much is going into the hands of too few? The new book the [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=434.24s)]
*  haves and the have yachts dispatches on the ultra rich goes on sale tomorrow and is available [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=439.76000000000005s)]
*  for pre-order right now yacht not included. New York Times best-selling author Evan Osnos thank you very much. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=446.56s)]
*  you [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-grRAGTrOY&t=459.04s)]
