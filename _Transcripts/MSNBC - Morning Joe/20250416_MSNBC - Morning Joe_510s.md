# 'Bad for all of us': London's mayor rebukes trade wars, protectionism, nativism
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E)
*  Vice President J.D. Vance is saying that there's a good chance the U.S. and the United Kingdom [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=0.0s)]
*  are going to be able to strike a trade deal in the near future. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=4.76s)]
*  The U.K. was included in President Trump's across-the-board 10 percent tariffs last week. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  The special relationship between the two countries has come under increased scrutiny in the first [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=12.72s)]
*  few months of the second Trump administration, after the president's tough comments about [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=17.64s)]
*  Ukraine and the economic volatility caused by the tariffs. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=22.56s)]
*  I will say, though, he does have right now a positive relationship with Keir Stormer, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=26.68s)]
*  according to the U.S. president and also with Prime Minister Stormer. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=34.36s)]
*  I sat down yesterday with London Mayor Sadiq Khan to discuss the city's relationship with [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=38.8s)]
*  the United States, as well as opportunities that could lie ahead for Europe in this new [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=44.08s)]
*  political era. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=48.72s)]
*  And of course, we had to talk about Liverpool. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=50.56s)]
*  Mr. Mayor, it's great to see you again. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=54.64s)]
*  It's great to have Morning Joe in London. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=56.64s)]
*  Make this permanent, not temporary. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=58.4s)]
*  I want to be here more, especially when Liverpool's this close to clinching the title. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=60.44s)]
*  Well, for those of you that don't know, although I'm the mayor of London, I support the greatest [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=66.24s)]
*  team in the world, Liverpool. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=70.0s)]
*  Your viewers will call it soccer, we call it football. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=73.24s)]
*  For the second time in 30 years, potentially, we could be Premier League champions, where [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=76.24s)]
*  13 points clear. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  There are 38 games in a season. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  There are six games to go, and it's looking pretty good for us. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  When I was here for the Queen's funeral, I recognized that she had inherited an ancient [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=90.16s)]
*  empire. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=95.56s)]
*  But as she passed, London was such a vibrant, postmodern, diverse place. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=97.2s)]
*  And actually, it seemed that London had become a melting pot in many ways that America always [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=103.68s)]
*  aspired to be. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=109.6s)]
*  I know there are views of yours in great cities like New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=111.08s)]
*  And I say with respect and humility, I think we've got the greatest city in the world in [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=116.11999999999999s)]
*  London. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  I think our diversity is one of our strengths. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=121.47999999999999s)]
*  It's not a weakness. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=124.19999999999999s)]
*  It makes us stronger, not weaker. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=125.19999999999999s)]
*  It makes us richer, not poorer. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=127.0s)]
*  I think we've embraced modernity in terms of you can be a proud Londoner and be Christian, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=129.68s)]
*  a proud Londoner and be proudly Jewish or Muslim like I am or a Hindu or a Sikh. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=135.0s)]
*  You can come to London and fulfill your dreams. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=140.96s)]
*  The joy of this great city is not just our history, which we keep, our heritage is really [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=143.56s)]
*  important, but we're moving forward as well. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=148.24s)]
*  And I think it's really important, particularly at a time when you've got this sort of protectionism, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=150.48000000000002s)]
*  this sort of nativism, where this sort of fear, people putting up walls that we carry [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  on putting up bridges. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=159.64000000000001s)]
*  It's so important. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  It's who we are. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=161.64000000000001s)]
*  The United States currently cutting funding for R&D, cutting funding for NIH, closing [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=162.72s)]
*  the doors to a lot of graduate students. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=168.64s)]
*  What are the opportunities for London and the rest of Europe? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=170.79999999999998s)]
*  I think London is a place to come if you want stability, if you want calm, if you want certainty. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=175.07999999999998s)]
*  Last year, two big elections in our city, in our country, my election, big mandate for [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=180.32s)]
*  me for another four years. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=185.16s)]
*  We had a new government elected last July with a huge mandate. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=186.66s)]
*  We are the number one city in the world for foreign direct investment. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=190.48s)]
*  We have more international students than any city in the world. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=194.6s)]
*  So pipeline of talent in relation to recruitment, retention and progression, but also got a [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=197.16s)]
*  stable democracy. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=203.04s)]
*  We respect the separation of powers, the legislature, the executive, the judiciary. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=205.39999999999998s)]
*  We have the rule of law. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=210.35999999999999s)]
*  Talk about Keir Stormer and how he's handling the relationship with President Trump. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=212.42s)]
*  I know you've had some some tough words back and forth, President Trump and you. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=217.68s)]
*  But right now, it seems Keir Stormer is developing a positive relationship with the president. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=222.76000000000002s)]
*  I think it's important that our prime minister works really hard to stay close with the USA [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=228.24s)]
*  through the president. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=235.60000000000002s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=236.60000000000002s)]
*  Because we're best friends. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=237.60000000000002s)]
*  We love America. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=238.84s)]
*  We love American culture. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=240.24s)]
*  We love American history. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=241.24s)]
*  We love American politics. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=243.24s)]
*  We even enjoy Hamilton. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=245.44s)]
*  The point being, though, is listen, we need America. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  We hope America needs us in a fraternal collegiate way. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=251.52s)]
*  How much are tariffs impacting London? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=255.8s)]
*  So far, not a lot, but I worry about the future. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=259.04s)]
*  Tariffs lead to prices going up. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=263.08s)]
*  They lead to inflation. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=264.56s)]
*  They can lead to interest rates going up. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=266.12s)]
*  They can lead to protectionism, which I think is bad for everyone. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=268.0s)]
*  I'm hoping that Prime Minister Keir Stormer and President Trump embrace this special relationship. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=271.36s)]
*  But also understand it's not just about the UK carving out a special deal. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=277.36s)]
*  I think a trade war between China and USA is bad for all of us. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=281.47999999999996s)]
*  I think a trade war between the USA and the EU is bad for all of us. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=285.52s)]
*  I think protectionism, nativism, unilateralism is bad for everyone. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=289.76s)]
*  When the USA embraces the world, I think the world benefits. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=295.44s)]
*  Speaking of nativism, a lot of people looked at Brexit as a precursor to Donald Trump winning in 2016. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=301.56s)]
*  Will Brexit ever be reversed? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=311.15999999999997s)]
*  So on our doorstep, we have a market, but also friends, encompassing 500 million people. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=313.32s)]
*  Any successful economy does most trade with its nearest neighbors. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=319.32s)]
*  Brexit has been a disaster for our economy. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=322.0s)]
*  Can it be reversed? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=324.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, I think it will take some time. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=325.79999999999995s)]
*  I think in this generation it's very hard because you'll respect the will of the British public in a referendum voting to leave the EU. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=327.32s)]
*  We're going to make the best of a bad hand. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=334.28s)]
*  And that's what Prime Minister Keir Stormer is trying to do. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=336.08s)]
*  He's used the phrase resetting relations with the EU. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=338.28s)]
*  And that means having closer alignment with the European Union. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=342.15999999999997s)]
*  I think, by the way, you can have close alignment with the EU and close relations with the USA. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=345.2s)]
*  There's not one versus the other. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=350.72s)]
*  I think Keir Stormer's played a bad hand really well. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=353.24s)]
*  By that I mean Brexit, but also, frankly speaking, you know, a president from the USA who wants to diverge away from close links with the UK, the EU and so forth. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=356.40000000000003s)]
*  That's why I support Prime Minister Keir Stormer in trying to build bridges with President Trump, but also at the same time building bridges with the European Union. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=366.12s)]
*  There are people inside the Trump administration that say diversity is a weakness, that look down on the diversification, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=374.84000000000003s)]
*  the multiculturalism that has actually strengthened America through the years. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=383.8s)]
*  What's your message as the mayor of a very vibrant, multicultural city? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=389.32s)]
*  I think, you know, you've got the success of most successful cities and countries. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=395.48s)]
*  That's by embracing difference, that's by being diverse, recognising us as a strength, not a weakness. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=401.04s)]
*  We joked when we began this conversation about the great football team Liverpool. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=406.28000000000003s)]
*  This is a football team owned by Americans, Fenway Sports Group. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=410.76000000000005s)]
*  Our manager is Dutch. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=414.08000000000004s)]
*  Our leading player is an Egyptian Muslim. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=417.0s)]
*  The king of defence is a Dutchman. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=420.84000000000003s)]
*  Our goalkeeper is a Brazilian Catholic. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=423.32000000000005s)]
*  We're the most successful team in English history with the champions of Europe not long ago. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=425.56s)]
*  That's a good metaphor, I think, for successful sports teams, businesses, cities and, dare I say, countries as well. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=430.84000000000003s)]
*  I'm hoping, look, without patronising in any way to all my friends and relations in America, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=438.68s)]
*  I think people will realise, you know, differences aren't to be scared about. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=445.64s)]
*  Of course, you need to make sure you keep your values, you know, democracy, respecting others, the rule of law, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=449.88s)]
*  but also recognise that actually, you know, building bridges is the way to break down fear, prejudice, ignorance, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=457.76000000000005s)]
*  but also to be successful in terms of the economy, culturally, socially and morally as well. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PXIk77n-5E&t=466.0s)]
