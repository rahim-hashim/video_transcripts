# 'Not worth the paper it's written on': Senator shreds new U.S. and Ukraine minerals deal
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA)
*  The White House says it has signed an economic partnership with Ukraine. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=0.0s)]
*  The deal will give America access to some of Ukraine's critical minerals and natural [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=4.7s)]
*  resources. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=10.6s)]
*  Treasury Secretary Scott Besson says this will accelerate Kyiv's economic recovery [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=11.84s)]
*  and repay America for the U.S. military aid. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=17.94s)]
*  It has provided something President Trump has been demanding. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=21.22s)]
*  According to the Washington Post, the deal falls short of providing any concrete security [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=25.28s)]
*  guarantees to Ukraine, but it does affirm a quote, long-term strategic alignment with [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=30.36s)]
*  the United States. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=36.32s)]
*  Joining us now, a Democratic member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=38.0s)]
*  Chris Murphy of Connecticut. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  Thank you for joining us. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=43.32s)]
*  What do you make of this agreement? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=46.32s)]
*  It's nonsense. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=51.16s)]
*  It just is. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=52.16s)]
*  Most of the minerals that are available for exploitation in Ukraine are in the parts of [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=54.16s)]
*  Ukraine that are controlled by Russia. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=58.64s)]
*  And so this agreement doesn't really mean much if Russia continues to own eastern Ukraine [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=61.239999999999995s)]
*  and continues to march towards Kyiv. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=66.56s)]
*  And right now, all indications are that Donald Trump's policy is to hand Ukraine to Vladimir [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=69.28s)]
*  Putin. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=75.19999999999999s)]
*  And in that case, this agreement isn't worth the paper that it's written on. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=76.19999999999999s)]
*  Vladimir Putin isn't sitting down to negotiate. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=80.52s)]
*  For one simple reason, because Donald Trump is telling him, I am not going to continue [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=84.03999999999999s)]
*  to support Ukraine militarily, no matter what, whether you sit down at the table or if you [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=88.6s)]
*  don't sit down at the table. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=93.56s)]
*  So Vladimir Putin looks at that and says, why would I negotiate? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=95.16s)]
*  You're telling me you are giving up on Ukraine. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=98.36s)]
*  So if I just continue to fight the war, I will ultimately own everything I have now [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=100.91999999999999s)]
*  or potentially everything, including Kyiv. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=106.0s)]
*  So this agreement means nothing if the Trump policy is, as it is today, to hand over Ukraine [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=108.94s)]
*  to Vladimir Putin. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=117.25999999999999s)]
*  That's the direction that we are heading in. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=118.25999999999999s)]
*  And right now, there is no sign that Vladimir Putin is giving up on the war and no sign [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=120.7s)]
*  that we're ever getting any deal on minerals because Vladimir Putin is going to be in charge. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=124.58s)]
*  So, Senator, how do you interpret the comments coming from the White House from Scott Berset, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=129.54s)]
*  for example, that this is some sort of a security guarantee because the United States [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=134.18s)]
*  isn't going to want to be doing business in Ukraine with Ukrainians and have those business [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=140.74s)]
*  interests attacked? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=146.38s)]
*  I mean, we're murky on the details of this deal. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=147.38s)]
*  We haven't really got them. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=150.54000000000002s)]
*  But we have had Scott Berset come out kind of putting saying that they want to free sovereign [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=151.94s)]
*  and independent Ukraine, for example. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=158.10000000000002s)]
*  Well, that would go against the idea that Russia could just walk in in three years' [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=161.18s)]
*  time and take Ukraine. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=164.42000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, these guys lie. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=166.42000000000002s)]
*  I mean, they lie. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=169.1s)]
*  That's not true, right? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=170.94s)]
*  Donald Trump spent all of the last year of Biden's presidency trying to kill aid for [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=171.94s)]
*  Ukraine. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=180.22s)]
*  If Donald Trump got his way, Ukraine wouldn't have any weapons right now. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=181.22s)]
*  Donald Trump has no plans to resupply Ukraine. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=185.3s)]
*  And by the way, Ukraine's going to start running out of bullets and start running out [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=188.38s)]
*  of serious weaponry by the summer and fall of this year. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=192.14s)]
*  That's why Putin continues to march forward, refuses to sit down at the negotiating table. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=197.42s)]
*  So there are all sorts of instances in which the president's national security team goes [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=202.22s)]
*  out and tells a story that isn't true. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=207.66s)]
*  What is true, unfortunately, is that Trump has decided that he will never support any [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=210.54s)]
*  additional weapons for Ukraine. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=215.74s)]
*  Trump will try to fill in the breach, but there are certain weapons systems that only [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=218.34s)]
*  the United States can provide. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=222.57999999999998s)]
*  And without us, Vladimir Putin ultimately is going to win this war. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=224.42s)]
*  That's just the truth, no matter what Scott Besson or Marco Rubio says. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=228.1s)]
*  And Willie from the New York Times, this is Scott Besson, the quote. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=232.85999999999999s)]
*  This agreement signals clearly to Russia that the Trump administration is committed to a [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=237.7s)]
*  peace process centered on a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine over the long-term [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=241.7s)]
*  Treasury, Secretary Scott Besson said in a statement. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=247.7s)]
*  President Trump envisioned this partnership between the American people and the Ukrainian [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=251.38s)]
*  people to show both sides commitment to lasting peace and prosperity in Ukraine. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=254.42s)]
*  And to be clear, no state or person who financed or supplied the Russian war machine will be [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=259.3s)]
*  allowed to benefit from the reconstruction of Ukraine. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=265.54s)]
*  Willie. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=270.26s)]
*  Yeah, we'll see if that holds up, because as the senator points out, otherwise giving [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=271.26s)]
*  Vladimir Putin everything he wants. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=274.8s)]
*  I want to turn you, Senator, to the floor speech you made on Tuesday in the Senate on [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=276.38s)]
*  the 100th day of this administration. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=281.34s)]
*  You also wrote an op-ed for Fox News talking about the corruption that you lay out in this [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=283.7s)]
*  administration just in the first 100 days. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=289.62s)]
*  It's a part of the story of this administration that I think doesn't get a lot of attention [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=291.98s)]
*  because there's just frankly so much else going on. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=295.94s)]
*  But where do you see the most egregious examples of corruption here? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=298.74s)]
*  Yeah, really the story of the first 100 days is a story of mass scale corruption. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=304.7s)]
*  This is the most corrupt White House that we have ever seen in the history of the country. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=311.7s)]
*  Listen, you know, the future of Pete Hegseth is interesting to me, but the most important [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=315.86s)]
*  thing happening right now is Donald Trump's attempt to normalize corruption, to do it [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=322.34s)]
*  at such a scale, at such a dizzying scale, that America and the media, frankly, just [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=326.38s)]
*  kind of accepts it. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=332.78000000000003s)]
*  The meme coin alone is the most corrupt thing an American president has ever done. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=335.26s)]
*  Donald Trump has set up a crypto coin in which any CEO, any foreign oligarch, any Saudi prince [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=340.14s)]
*  can send him millions of dollars secretly online. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=346.66s)]
*  He just last week announced that he is monetizing the White House in order to prompt individuals [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=351.06s)]
*  to buy his meme coin. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=355.94s)]
*  He is going to give exclusive tours of the people's house, the White House, if you give [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=357.1s)]
*  him money through his meme coin. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=361.78s)]
*  This is extraordinary. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=363.65999999999997s)]
*  If people were selling access to City Hall as a first selectman or a mayor in Connecticut, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=364.65999999999997s)]
*  you would get run out of town on a rail. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=370.78s)]
*  And yet, because it's Donald Trump and he's corrupt every single day, everybody just kind [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=373.14s)]
*  of shrugs their shoulders. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=377.62s)]
*  The problem here is that if he gets away with this, then corruption does become normalized. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=378.76s)]
*  Almost every single big corporation that gave him a check for his inauguration has had federal [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=384.18s)]
*  lawsuits or investigations against them dropped. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=389.86s)]
*  It's just an open secret that if you support the president financially, he will do whatever [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=393.18s)]
*  you want when it comes to business you have before the federal government. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=398.26s)]
*  So yes, I think we have to talk about this a lot more. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=401.86s)]
*  I think the country has to talk about this a lot more, because if you don't, then future [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=404.78000000000003s)]
*  presidents, future governors are going to be able to get away with stealing the people's [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=411.38s)]
*  money, because we've all kind of looked the other way when Donald Trump did it at scale. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=414.58000000000004s)]
*  And you lay out many more examples of this in that Fox News piece that people can check [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=419.66s)]
*  out. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=423.58000000000004s)]
*  Democratic Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut Senator, thanks as always. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=424.58000000000004s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=427.18s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mah5NSGOYDA&t=428.18s)]
