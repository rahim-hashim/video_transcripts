# Trump ramps up deportations but is still far below the pace it wants: Report
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA)
*  New data and customs enforcement shows the Trump administration has dramatically stepped [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=0.0s)]
*  up its pace of deportations. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=4.8s)]
*  In April, ICE deported more than 17,000 people, an increase of about 29 percent compared with [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=6.66s)]
*  this time last year. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=13.1s)]
*  While that pace does put President Trump on track to meet his promise to deport millions [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=14.58s)]
*  and millions of people, as he put it, it appears the pressure his administration is putting [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=19.6s)]
*  on ICE to make arrests is yielding results. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=23.54s)]
*  Let's bring in NBC News senior Homeland Security correspondent Julia Ainsley for more on her [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=28.14s)]
*  exclusive reporting on this issue. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=32.9s)]
*  Julia, good morning. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=35.02s)]
*  What did you find? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=36.02s)]
*  Well, Willie, we've been able to bring you what we believe are the clearest depictions [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=37.02s)]
*  of ICE deportations. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=41.54s)]
*  A lot of times we'll hear numbers from Tom Homan and others that include Coast Guard [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=42.96s)]
*  interdictions, people turned around at the border, even people who self-deport. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=47.38s)]
*  We've been able each month to get a snapshot of exactly who ICE is deporting, and that [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=50.900000000000006s)]
*  That includes people who are arrested at the border, but anyone who's actually flown back [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=55.62s)]
*  and deported in what we would consider the traditional sense. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=59.5s)]
*  Each month up until this point, and now we're looking back at April, we hope soon to have [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=63.3s)]
*  May, but each month the Trump administration had actually been lower than the Biden administration, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=67.42s)]
*  in part because there were fewer people coming across the border to arrest and deport. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=73.58s)]
*  Now though, for the first time looking at April, that number jumped. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=77.8s)]
*  It's over 17,300. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=80.58s)]
*  That is now larger than it was under the Biden administration for the same time period [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=83.28s)]
*  last year, but it is still, if he kept up with that pace of 17,300 over 12 months, he [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=87.88s)]
*  would still be less than half of the annual record set by President Obama in 2013. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=94.52s)]
*  That's back when Obama was called the Deporter-in-Chief, and it wouldn't get him anywhere near that [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=99.88s)]
*  millions of millions that you mentioned that was in his inauguration day promise. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=104.0s)]
*  So what we're looking at though is a number of things that ICE has put into place to try [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=108.34s)]
*  to quicken the pace of deportations. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=112.16000000000001s)]
*  Remember, Willie, there was a lot of pressure on ICE. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=114.2s)]
*  They set quotas for agents. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=116.84s)]
*  They got rid of the first acting director of ICE. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=118.58s)]
*  Now this is the first full month of data we've been able to see under the new acting director, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=121.4s)]
*  Todd Lyons. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=125.48s)]
*  They've done things like add 47 new detention facilities since Trump took office. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=126.60000000000001s)]
*  That includes working with state and local jails, the Bureau of Prisons, but more places [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=130.88s)]
*  to hold immigrants, which I'm told is one of the hardest parts of the equation if you're [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=135.48000000000002s)]
*  trying to deport a lot of people. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=139.42s)]
*  They've increased the number of arrests and they've increased the number of flights. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=142.22s)]
*  They were looking at about eight to 10 flights per day earlier. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=145.7s)]
*  Now they're up to 11 to 13 flights per day, according to someone who tracks these tail [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=148.85999999999999s)]
*  numbers and is witness at the border. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=154.6s)]
*  So this is all a larger picture that they are actually trying to ramp this up because [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=156.94s)]
*  we know behind the scenes there's been a lot of hand wringing and finger pointing about [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=160.54s)]
*  why these numbers weren't actually higher, Willie. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=164.7s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's obviously he's not going to get to the millions of millions of people [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=168.62s)]
*  deported. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=172.86s)]
*  That was a foundational promise of his presidential campaign. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=173.86s)]
*  I guess the question is if they do step up and arrest more than they've been arresting [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=176.70000000000002s)]
*  and as you point out in your reporting, they have done that over the last couple of months. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=180.76000000000002s)]
*  What is that screening process like? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=184.94s)]
*  Do they run a higher risk of deporting people without the due process that so many people [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=186.78s)]
*  have been worried about? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=191.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, certainly. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=193.10000000000002s)]
*  Certainly. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=194.18s)]
*  I mean, when you look at the people who were sent to El Salvador, the people who were sent [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=195.18s)]
*  to South Sudan, there's been a lot of questions from courts about were these people given [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=198.94s)]
*  reasonable time to appeal their deportation. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=202.54s)]
*  The ones we're looking at deported by ICE, the vast majority of those when you take out [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=205.74s)]
*  the 230 sent to El Salvador were deported under Title 8. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=210.82s)]
*  That means they went through the Immigration Nationality Act. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=214.9s)]
*  They had final orders of deportation. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=217.7s)]
*  But sometimes when you want to span arrests so widely, it is possible that you could arrest [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=220.08s)]
*  more people that can actually be deported. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=225.72s)]
*  In fact, we were the first to report that there were many that were being arrested that [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=227.84s)]
*  were then released back onto the streets within the first crop of about 8000 arrests. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=231.60000000000002s)]
*  Over 460 were released again. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=236.84s)]
*  And so that can happen as well. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=239.44s)]
*  When you want to make a wider net, it's possible that there are a lot of non criminals as well. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=240.8s)]
*  Joe? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=246.48000000000002s)]
*  All right, NBC News, senior Homeland Security correspondent Julia Ainsley. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=247.95999999999998s)]
*  Thank you so much for your reporting. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIcD6Kln0uA&t=251.72s)]
