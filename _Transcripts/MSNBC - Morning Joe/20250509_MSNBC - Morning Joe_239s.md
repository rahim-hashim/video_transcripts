# Retired Supreme Court Justice David Souter has died
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE)
*  Welcome back. Breaking news. News just into us this morning that retired [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=0.0s)]
*  Associate Justice of the Supreme Court David Sutter has died at the age of 85. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  Sutter was appointed to the court by then-President George H.W. Bush in 1990 [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=9.6s)]
*  and served more than 19 years before retiring in 2009. Chief Justice John [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  Roberts said in a statement that Justice David Sutter served our court with great [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=20.72s)]
*  distinction for nearly 20 years. He brought uncommon wisdom and kindness to [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=24.68s)]
*  a lifetime of public service. After retiring to his beloved New Hampshire in [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=29.32s)]
*  2009, he continued to render significant service to our branch by sitting [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=33.36s)]
*  regularly on the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit for more than a [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=38.16s)]
*  decade. He will be greatly missed. Sutter died peacefully yesterday at his home in [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=41.88s)]
*  New Hampshire. Doug Brinkley, he was appointed by a Republican president but [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=48.08s)]
*  became a mainstay of the liberal wing of the court. Retired young, he was only 69 [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=52.68s)]
*  but he wanted to go back home to New Hampshire, allowing President Barack [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=57.12s)]
*  Obama to appoint Justice Sutter Mayor. He was someone who was known as, you know, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=60.68s)]
*  not one for Washington's social circuit but rather come home with a [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=65.75999999999999s)]
*  book, very thoughtful, very learned, and someone who, as we heard from Chief [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=69.88s)]
*  Justice Roberts, will be missed. A real Massachusetts intellectual. I mean he had [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=73.52s)]
*  a really a great bond with John Sununu who convinced George Herbert Walker [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=78.84s)]
*  Bush, don't worry, he's a conservative. But after Clarence Thomas got into the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=84.44s)]
*  court, Sutter kind of became, saw his role as being a middle-winged person. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=90.19999999999999s)]
*  There are some major cases he sided with liberals. I mean I'm just off the top of [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=95.72s)]
*  my head can remember his, you know, I remember his dealing with Planned [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=100.84s)]
*  Parenthood and making sure that, you know, that that continued and I recall [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=110.08s)]
*  that he was able to talk about things like not having cameras in the Supreme [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=115.6s)]
*  Court because it become become a circus and now look at it right now at the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=120.84s)]
*  White House where the cameras every day it becomes like a reality show. So he [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=125.28s)]
*  goes down as a great justice and one that was able to kind of hang in there [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=129.88s)]
*  in the middle, didn't like things radical to happen all at once, an [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=135.6s)]
*  incrementalist in the court. Susan Page, you've obviously followed the Supreme [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=139.51999999999998s)]
*  Court for a long time. I want to hear your thoughts about the legacy of [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=144.24s)]
*  Justice Sutter including how the way his views perhaps shifted on the court [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=147.92s)]
*  changed the way the White House vets potential members of the highest court [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=155.04s)]
*  in the land. Yeah, Justice Sutter, the experience with Justice Sutter changed [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=159.88s)]
*  the way White House has handled Supreme Court nominations because what George H. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=164.28s)]
*  W. Bush had was the assurance of Senator Warren Rudman that his good friend [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=168.84s)]
*  David Sutter would be a conservative voice, but they didn't know that from [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=173.08s)]
*  from the experience that he had on the bench. They didn't have ideological [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=176.76s)]
*  writings that shows in that they sort of took Rudman's word for it and then of [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=181.44s)]
*  course once he got on the court he did not behave in the way President Bush had [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=185.52s)]
*  expected him to not the conservative voice much to the anger of many [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=189.52s)]
*  conservatives because you only get so many chances to nominate a Supreme Court [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=193.44s)]
*  Justice. Since then no president has put forward a justice knowing as little [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=198.12s)]
*  about how he or she is going to behave on the court bench as happened with with [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=205.4s)]
*  Justice Sutter. He was an object lesson in the negative for presidents thinking [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=210.24s)]
*  about these key appointments, Jonathan. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=215.0s)]
*  President Trump is [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOqz_j2qlZE&t=218.0s)]
