Video Description: An initial assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency concludes that the U.S. airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear enrichment sites over the weekend were not as effective as President Donald Trump said and that they set the country's nuclear program back by only three to six months, according to three people with knowledge of the report. Meanwhile, the president is doubling down on claiming the sites were totally obliterated. The Morning Joe panel discusses.

# 'Very dangerous slope' for Trump to challenge U.S. intelligence: Andrea Mitchell
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4)
*  We turn now to indeed the matters of Iran an initial assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=0.0s)]
*  Concludes that America's strike on Tehran were not as effective as President Trump has been claiming [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=5.8s)]
*  Earlier this week Trump said the bombs completely obliterated Tehran's nuclear facilities [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=11.92s)]
*  But now three people with knowledge of that report say the strikes only set the country's program back by three to six months [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=17.36s)]
*  One source told NBC News this this assessment is already finding that these core pieces are still intact [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=25.8s)]
*  The White House however is vehemently denying the report a statement from press secretary [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=33.64s)]
*  Caroline Levitt reads in part this alleged assessment is flat-out wrong and a clear attempt to demean President Trump [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=39.2s)]
*  Everyone knows what happens when you drop [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  1430,000 pound bombs perfectly on their targets [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=49.72s)]
*  Total obliteration she says according to Axios Israeli intelligence services believe the strikes caused very [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=52.6s)]
*  significant damage to Iran's nuclear program [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=60.16s)]
*  But they're still working on a final assessment these things do take time joining us now NBC News chief [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=63.4s)]
*  Foreign affairs correspondent Andrea Mitchell former spokesperson for the US mission to the United Nations Hagar Shamali [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=71.0s)]
*  She also worked at the NSC and the Treasury Department and your Times columnist Nick Christoph our thanks to you all being here [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=77.48s)]
*  A truly great group Andrea. I'll start with you [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=85.28s)]
*  Give us the latest if you will from what we're hearing from the White House and President Trump again [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=88.04s)]
*  While they're at the Hague really angrily [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=95.48s)]
*  Dismissing the idea that this wasn't a complete and utter success [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=98.76s)]
*  The strikes over the weekend [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=103.0s)]
*  But as we've been talking about all morning these things do take time to try to figure out exactly [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=105.08s)]
*  Exactly what happened so talk to us about the theater of this. Why do you think? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=110.8s)]
*  Trump is so you know vociferous and what he's saying and what it could mean for [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=115.52s)]
*  Next steps as we learn more and more as to what actually happened [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=120.88s)]
*  I think we are in a very dangerous slope a slippery slope if you will because [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=124.5s)]
*  For the president of the United States to be challenging American intelligence, and this is the Defense Intelligence [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=129.4s)]
*  Agency now they were making it very clear [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=137.20000000000002s)]
*  the chairman of the Joint Chiefs [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=139.96s)]
*  General came the other day after the strike that it's going to take time. They have to do a lot of analysis [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=142.32000000000002s)]
*  This is a preliminary analysis. It was not as Carol Levitt suggested [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=148.04000000000002s)]
*  deliberately leaked to demean the president to set up that kind of [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=154.04000000000002s)]
*  Criticism of the intelligence agency and to criticize the analysts as Marco Rubio did an interview [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=158.16s)]
*  Which aired earlier on the program is to basically say to us intelligence will start [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=163.96s)]
*  You know shading your analysis to please the president [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  That's what that kind of interference is exactly what got us into a rock when you know [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=174.8s)]
*  We were told it was a slam dunk when they relied on one analyst curveball [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=180.86s)]
*  Who was a German source and turned out to be you know a fraudulent source who had his own agenda? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=185.52s)]
*  So you know that's how you get into forever wars and so not only the MAGA base, but you know important [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=192.28s)]
*  Analysts independent analysts should be very concerned when the intelligence community is to be in this way [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=200.36s)]
*  I met with the Iranian foreign minister on Friday in Geneva. We were the only [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=205.12s)]
*  Only [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=209.96s)]
*  Western source that had an interview with foreign minister Arachi before he went on to [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=211.79999999999998s)]
*  Moscow and of course within 24 hours he and the rest of the world were shocked by the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=216.84s)]
*  American strike and what he said to me is we think that this diplomacy the [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=223.64s)]
*  Witkoff diplomacy is a cover that we're being betrayed because the Israelis struck us and we think that [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=228.51999999999998s)]
*  The Americans that President Trump is just you know covering with this decoy with he didn't use the word decoy [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=234.78s)]
*  But he used the word cover-up. It's a betrayal because they were covering for the Israelis well it turned out [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=241.4s)]
*  They were actually decoying for the American strike as well so to maintain credibility [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=246.5s)]
*  the president I [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=253.5s)]
*  Assume is saying that it was obliterated [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=255.74s)]
*  He said that Saturday night before they had any analysis of the bomb damage assessment [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=257.5s)]
*  And that's a political response that's not an intelligence response [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=262.58000000000004s)]
*  And I think you know you know so well Jonathan covering this for so many years [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=266.38s)]
*  How important it is to do the kind of analysis the kind of reporting that David Ignatius did in his column today in the Washington Post [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=270.78000000000003s)]
*  He's uniquely capable of doing that kind of intelligence and that you know analysis the Israelis are somewhere in the middle the Israelis think that [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=276.90000000000003s)]
*  It is you know more dangerous that they still have that highly enriched uranium [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=284.66s)]
*  So did the IAEA so that's what the head of the IAEA the independent analysis [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=291.28000000000003s)]
*  Said gross he said that on Sunday that they probably trucked it out of there, and that's the problem [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=297.16s)]
*  This isn't over and that's what frankly the Arab world is a you know concerned about [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=302.68s)]
*  That this is not over that Qatar and others are most likely worried about [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=308.16s)]
*  People that I've spoken to that the Israelis are going to go back in with any sign that there still is a nuclear program [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=312.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and as you're right Andrew this is far from the first time the president Trump has criticized US intelligence agencies [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=320.08s)]
*  He did so famously at Helsinki other times since but it would be an entirely different matter [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=325.47999999999996s)]
*  If the intelligence starts to shake because of pressure from the White House to give him the story he wants to tell [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=329.0s)]
*  Hagar, but I wanted to go exactly where area was taking us [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=334.96s)]
*  There is just the Iran the Iranian side of this first of all you you have noted that they [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=337.76s)]
*  Must have had some census was coming and probably took preparations just to try to salvage or move [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=343.28s)]
*  Parts of their program or the Iranian itself walk us through that you know an area of the world you know so well and also [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=348.91999999999996s)]
*  What you think their next steps will be? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=356.12s)]
*  Going for sure well so you know when it comes first to these assessments [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=359.59999999999997s)]
*  I would caution having been in government a long time that preliminary assessments are just that they're just [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=365.06s)]
*  preliminary and when they leak it's a problem because [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=369.28s)]
*  It's not really the whole picture and so right now what you have is a situation where we don't entirely know [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=372.04s)]
*  This is what what the the state of Iran's nuclear program [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=379.0s)]
*  We know the job was not finished and that in and of itself whatever you think about [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=383.28000000000003s)]
*  Israel strikes and the United States joining them that creates an inherent risk [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=387.64s)]
*  Because if they've got if they still have the enriched uranium which they might have been able to move and we heard Vice President [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=391.92s)]
*  Vance say that [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=398.08s)]
*  Enriched uranium by the way is kind of like big discs like big heavy hockey pucks [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=399.52000000000004s)]
*  So they're not difficult to move, but they are highly radioactive [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=404.28000000000003s)]
*  It's not something that you throw in the trunk of your car and put in your garage [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=407.56s)]
*  This is so it's it's if they don't have nuclear facilities to then move that enriched uranium [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=410.68s)]
*  Then I would caution anybody thinking that that they are even months away from creating a nuclear weapon, but that said [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=415.84000000000003s)]
*  When you have a situation where the Iranians now have still some kind of [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=421.64000000000004s)]
*  Fuel or or whatever remains of their nuclear facilities and the job is not finished and I don't mean to sound like Donald Rumsfeld here [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=427.68s)]
*  but if you do have the job not finished you have a situation here where they are still going to be incentivized to finish that nuclear [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=434.47999999999996s)]
*  weapon and [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=440.44s)]
*  Israel on its end is not going to accept that which is why the ceasefire is going to be so fragile [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=441.56s)]
*  And I believe that President Trump is going to have a hard time [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=446.52s)]
*  Holding Israel back if Israel sees any activity with that that concerns them or they see movement of this enriched uranium [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=450.15999999999997s)]
*  They're going to strike it because they're going to argue. Well, this is in our interest and we don't see [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=456.4s)]
*  Negotiations or diplomacy working as it hasn't for this many years and by the way as it hadn't been working during President Trump's administration [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=461.68s)]
*  Right. We know that during the negotiations the Iranian regime [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=469.48s)]
*  Surged its enrichment of weapons great [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=473.68s)]
*  Uranium by 50% the IAEA in May reported this and said that they had enough nuclear material for nine or ten nuclear weapons [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=477.03999999999996s)]
*  So this is how Israel's thinking about it and that's something that Trump is going to struggle with in terms of maintaining the ceasefire [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=484.36s)]
*  Yeah, President Trump has said that he won't strike further. He's communicated that to Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=489.96000000000004s)]
*  This is a one and done [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=494.64s)]
*  But Nick Kristof you wrote over the weekend in the aftermath of this strike [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=495.96000000000004s)]
*  The three unknowns after the US attack on Iran the headline there now some of that's you know [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=500.64s)]
*  We're now a few days later [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=506.0s)]
*  What things are still quite what questions are still front of mind for you as we? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=507.76s)]
*  sift through exactly what happened on the weekend and the president considers next steps I [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=513.96s)]
*  think the fundamental ones are [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=518.76s)]
*  What happens to the Iranian nuclear program and whether this has done more to end it or to accelerate it? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=521.4s)]
*  You know fundamentally the aims here of both Israel and the Trump administration were to [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=529.88s)]
*  to end the Iranian nuclear program and [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=536.5600000000001s)]
*  Ideally depending on who you talk to to end the Iranian regime [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=539.4399999999999s)]
*  And I think they're pretty fundamental doubts about whether either has advanced [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=542.48s)]
*  You know in my reporting in Iran. I've seen how unpopular that regime is it's oppressive. It's misogynistic [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=547.32s)]
*  Everybody almost everybody you talk to complaints about the corruption the hypocrisy [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=555.68s)]
*  The economic inefficiency of the regime remember once talking to a revolutionary guard [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=560.96s)]
*  Guarding the former American Embassy now called the den of spies [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=565.88s)]
*  And you know he told me his favorite movie was Titanic and he asked about coming to the US and that's a revolutionary guard [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=569.28s)]
*  But now you see something of a rally around the flag effect [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=576.6800000000001s)]
*  It's hard to know how long that will go on [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=580.32s)]
*  But it certainly you don't get the sense the regime is immediately crumbling and then on the on the nuclear side [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=582.08s)]
*  You know we have lost track of that 400 kilograms of highly enriched uranium that had been in Isfahan [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXhSjPi-LE4&t=588.2s)]
