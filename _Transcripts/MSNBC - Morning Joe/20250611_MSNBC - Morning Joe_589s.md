# Violation of military regulations: Tom Nichols rebukes Trump’s speech at Fort Bragg
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo)
*  President Trump yesterday gave a partisan rally-style speech at Fort Bragg in North Carolina [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=0.0s)]
*  and did so in front of active duty troops. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  And for a little news for the fake news back there, the fake news, ladies and gentlemen, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=11.08s)]
*  look at them, look at them all, oh yeah, what I have to put up with. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=15.32s)]
*  Fake news. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  What I have to put up with. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=23.32s)]
*  I got to talk to my friends here today. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=24.92s)]
*  This is a record crowd. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=28.32s)]
*  You know, you never had a crowd this big. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=29.32s)]
*  That's an honor. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=31.92s)]
*  You think this crowd would have showed up for Biden? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=35.24s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=37.28s)]
*  In Los Angeles, the governor of California and the mayor of Los Angeles, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=39.88s)]
*  they're incompetent. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  They were put into the United States and allowed to stay here because we had a grossly, grossly [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=54.199999999999996s)]
*  unfit president who listened to whoever was operating the auto pen. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=61.44s)]
*  And they allowed these people to stay. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=68.92s)]
*  And by the way, I've known this guy for a long time. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=70.52s)]
*  He was never the sharpest bolt. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=72.67999999999999s)]
*  But you know what he was? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=75.16s)]
*  He wasn't a radical left lunatic. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=76.16s)]
*  He never dreamt about open borders. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=78.94s)]
*  He never said that when he was of sound mind, which actually was a very long time ago. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=80.92s)]
*  So sad what they've done to our country. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=87.56s)]
*  I was in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=91.32000000000001s)]
*  We brought back $5.1 trillion into our country. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=95.96000000000001s)]
*  And all three leaders, they're great leaders. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=99.32000000000001s)]
*  All three said, you know, you are presiding over the hottest country anywhere in the world. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=101.92s)]
*  And they said the exact same thing. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=108.36s)]
*  They said six months ago, it was the coldest country. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=109.92s)]
*  I'll tell you, change on a date. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=113.72s)]
*  You know what November 5th was? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=115.2s)]
*  It was the election of a president that loves you. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=116.76s)]
*  And that's when it all changed. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=120.08s)]
*  And Tom Nichols, you wrote about this speech in your latest piece for the Atlantic. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=123.52s)]
*  And we're going to read part of it now. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=126.72s)]
*  You say that President Trump, quote, led soldiers in a display of unseemly behavior that ran [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=128.68s)]
*  to everything. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=135.68s)]
*  The founder of the U.S. Army, George Washington, strove to imbue in the American Armed Forces. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=136.68s)]
*  Where is the Army chief of staff, General Randy George? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  You write, will he speak truth to the commander in chief and put a stop to the assault on [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=146.32s)]
*  the integrity of his troops? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=151.60000000000002s)]
*  Where is the commander of the airborne troops, Lieutenant General Gregory Anderson, or even [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=153.84s)]
*  Colonel Chad Nixon, the base commander? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=158.5s)]
*  Where is the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Dan Cain? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=161.44000000000003s)]
*  Will any of these men say one word? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=165.76000000000002s)]
*  The top officers of the U.S. military were eagles or stars on their shoulders that give [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=168.36s)]
*  them great privilege, as befits people who assume responsibility for the defense of the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=173.70000000000002s)]
*  nation and the welfare of their troops. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=178.72000000000003s)]
*  They command the power of life and death itself on the field of battle. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=182.06s)]
*  But those ranks also carry immense responsibility. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=186.84s)]
*  If they are truly Washington's hares, they should speak up now and stand with the first [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=190.62s)]
*  commander in chief against the rogue 47th. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=197.86s)]
*  And Tom, your story really went viral last night, gained a lot of traction, resonated [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=202.02s)]
*  with a lot of people. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=207.38s)]
*  Tell us more about this argument, because we know in the Trump first term, there were [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=209.18s)]
*  times when the Pentagon defied him, when Secretary of Defense Mattis, others, told him no. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=213.28s)]
*  We're not seeing that around this time around. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=219.58s)]
*  No, he learned his lesson from his first term, which is to stack the institutions around [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=221.78s)]
*  him with sycophants and yes men and people who have no real authority in their own right, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=229.94s)]
*  other than as reflections of the power of Donald Trump. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=238.94s)]
*  Nonetheless, there are senior military officers who had careers long before there was a Donald [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=242.42000000000002s)]
*  Trump in office. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=248.54s)]
*  And they know this is wrong. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=250.54s)]
*  They know this is absolutely wrong. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=251.95999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump led these young men and women in not just an unseemly dismay, a violation [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=253.34s)]
*  of military decorum and a violation of military regulations. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=259.26s)]
*  I taught military officers for 25 years. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=262.74s)]
*  If I had walked into a room like that and led jeers against elected American officials, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=265.86s)]
*  not only would I have been in trouble, but any military officer who had clapped along [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=273.98s)]
*  with that would have been in a hell of a lot of hot water as well, because we pride [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=278.1s)]
*  ourselves on an apolitical, nonpartisan military that serves, first of all, the Constitution [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=282.92s)]
*  and the elected leaders, whoever they are, as chosen by the American people. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=291.16s)]
*  We don't have a military that is out there hooting and nodding and laughing at ridiculing [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=297.94s)]
*  a former commander in chief, a sitting governor, the mayor of a major city. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=305.90000000000003s)]
*  That's playing with political fire. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=311.14s)]
*  And Donald Trump knows it. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=313.26s)]
*  He doesn't care. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=314.82s)]
*  This is really important to point out. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=316.38s)]
*  He doesn't care about any of those people in the military. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=317.38s)]
*  They are just fodder for him. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=319.98s)]
*  They are just raw material for his ego and for his autocratic plans. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=321.46000000000004s)]
*  And somebody has to speak up. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=326.62s)]
*  Anyone with stars on their shoulders needs to say something and lead these young men [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=329.94s)]
*  and women. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=336.06s)]
*  It's not their fault, their responsibility. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=337.06s)]
*  Maybe there should be better training, better explanation about why they shouldn't have [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=339.34s)]
*  been doing that. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=344.42s)]
*  But in the end, the fault lies with their officers and their leadership. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=345.42s)]
*  And, Tom, we were saying earlier this idea that for President Trump, he really seems [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=348.02s)]
*  to be putting forth this image, this notion that it's his military. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=353.6s)]
*  It's not the United States' military. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=357.38s)]
*  It's his military. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=359.42s)]
*  We see that not just yesterday with the backdrop there at Fort Bragg, but also the way he is [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=360.62s)]
*  using the armed forces on the streets of Los Angeles right now over the objections of that [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=365.58000000000004s)]
*  state's governor, as well as what we will see this weekend when he commemorates the [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=370.94s)]
*  Army's birthday, but does so, of course, on the streets of Washington, D.C., on his own [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=377.58000000000004s)]
*  birthday. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=383.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=384.1s)]
*  He thinks of the military as toy soldiers. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=385.1s)]
*  He thinks of them as pieces to be moved about, to serve him, to give him parades, to salute [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=388.5s)]
*  him, to call him sir. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=395.06s)]
*  He loves all that stuff. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=396.74s)]
*  That's what he thinks the military is. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=398.46s)]
*  And as the Atlantic, as you know, reported a while back, he thinks that the people who [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=400.98s)]
*  actually made the ultimate sacrifice, the people who gave their lives for this country [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=405.94s)]
*  are just losers and suckers. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=410.14s)]
*  They're just saps who ended up under a white headstone somewhere. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=412.9s)]
*  He loves the pump. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=419.1s)]
*  He loves the obedience. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=420.1s)]
*  And he loves the idea that the military is also his personal muscle, that it's his personal [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=421.1s)]
*  security force to be used at will, which is really what's going on in Los Angeles. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=426.18s)]
*  What he's doing in Los Angeles isn't really about Los Angeles. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=431.5s)]
*  It's about setting up the idea and getting people used to the idea that Donald Trump [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=434.72s)]
*  can bypass your local community, your state, your county governments, and just put troops [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=439.38s)]
*  in your streets any time he feels like it, because he's the president and these people [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=446.02s)]
*  in uniform are his personal security force. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=451.14s)]
*  Tom, we talk a lot and we have for years about Donald Trump's violation of norms. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=454.18s)]
*  Could you actually spell out in more practical real world terms the danger and risk of a [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=459.65999999999997s)]
*  military that is actually political instead of apolitical? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=465.58s)]
*  All you have to do is look around the world and look through history. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=469.41999999999996s)]
*  Do Americans want to have a Latin American military that snaps to attention to some [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=475.1s)]
*  cardio, to some guy wearing a big hat who says that in the words of a Latin American [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=483.06s)]
*  dictator in the 30s, for my friends everything, for my enemies the law and the military will [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4m55W8kkCo&t=491.14s)]
