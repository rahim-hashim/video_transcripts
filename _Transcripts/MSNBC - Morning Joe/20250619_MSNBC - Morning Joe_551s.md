# Obama warns the U.S. is 'dangerously close' to slipping into an autocracy
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o)
*  In rare public remarks, former President Barack Obama [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=0.0s)]
*  warned that the United States is dangerously close [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=3.6s)]
*  to slipping into an autocracy under the Trump administration. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=7.2s)]
*  The former president spoke to Sinaitan in Hartford, Connecticut, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=10.64s)]
*  where he criticized President Trump [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=13.64s)]
*  and questioned the administration's commitment to democracy. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=15.72s)]
*  But Obama also challenged affluent progressives [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=19.72s)]
*  who were, quote, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=22.88s)]
*  comfortable in their righteousness during his presidency. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=24.12s)]
*  Democracy is not self-executing. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=28.92s)]
*  It requires people, judges and people in the Justice Department [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  and people throughout the government [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=39.56s)]
*  who take an oath to uphold the Constitution. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=43.44s)]
*  When that isn't happening, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=48.64s)]
*  we start drifting into something [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=53.36s)]
*  that is not consistent with American democracy. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  It is consistent with autocracies. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=65.52s)]
*  I think that we are dangerously close [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=68.44s)]
*  to normalizing behavior like that. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=76.36s)]
*  We've lost a monoculture. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=81.64s)]
*  We've lost everybody watching Walter Cronkite. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=85.32s)]
*  We've lost everybody watching MASH or Mary Tyler Moore [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=90.0s)]
*  or All in the Family or Roots. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=95.6s)]
*  We've lost everybody getting a Time magazine. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=98.32s)]
*  It makes it more difficult now for us [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=104.52s)]
*  to find common ground. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=109.88s)]
*  It makes it easier for demagogues to divide us. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=113.24s)]
*  You could be as progressive and socially conscious [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=119.28s)]
*  as you wanted, and you did not have to pay a price. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=122.6s)]
*  You could still make a lot of money, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=127.72s)]
*  have a house in the Hamptons, and still be, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=130.04s)]
*  and still think of yourself as a progressive. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=133.64s)]
*  And now things are a little different. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=136.48s)]
*  We now have a situation in which all of us [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=138.88s)]
*  are going to be tested in some way, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=142.2s)]
*  and we are going to have to then decide [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=145.56s)]
*  what our commitments are. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=148.28s)]
*  You might lose some of your donors if you're a university, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=149.67999999999998s)]
*  and if you're a law firm, your billings [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=157.79999999999998s)]
*  might drop a little bit, which means you cannot [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=159.44s)]
*  remodel that kitchen in your house in the Hamptons [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=163.52s)]
*  this summer. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=167.44s)]
*  So there's been a lot of debate lately [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=168.44s)]
*  about President Obama, whether he should [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=170.4s)]
*  be more front and center. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=171.88s)]
*  We heard from him this week, Mara. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=173.16s)]
*  And I think he sort of said what most Democrats say [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=175.32s)]
*  about the dangers posed by Trump and the fact [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  how hard it is to break through in this very fractured society. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=180.4s)]
*  But I'm curious as to what you think about that last sound [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=182.96s)]
*  bite there. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=185.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=186.0s)]
*  His criticism of progressiveness, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=186.52s)]
*  those in his own party. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=190.44s)]
*  Well, I think it wasn't just a criticism. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=192.04s)]
*  It was a call to action. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=193.96s)]
*  I think we sometimes forget that Barack Obama's [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=196.16s)]
*  beginning in political life was actually in organizing. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=200.4s)]
*  And I really saw this as a call to action [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=204.8s)]
*  to everyday Americans, but to especially everyday Americans [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=208.32s)]
*  who are professionals, who may have some agency to say, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=212.28s)]
*  who may have some agency to speak out, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=217.68s)]
*  whether at their job, in their community, to say, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=221.12s)]
*  hey, democracy requires you to act now [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=225.4s)]
*  in your own personal life, to stand up [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=229.08s)]
*  for what you believe in, to say something when your neighbor is [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=231.20000000000002s)]
*  having their rights stripped away. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=237.52s)]
*  And I think that there is this tension [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=239.36s)]
*  between Democratic voters in particular, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=241.44000000000003s)]
*  looking for some kind of leader to save them. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=245.08s)]
*  When all the time Barack Obama, I think in this, is hinting at, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=248.16000000000003s)]
*  this needs to be a pro-democracy movement. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=252.52s)]
*  And this needs to come from the bottom up. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=255.56s)]
*  I think she is absolutely right. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=258.16s)]
*  The other thing is, as somebody that's [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=261.12s)]
*  been active on the field for a long time, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=263.08000000000004s)]
*  you use the term progressive. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=266.6s)]
*  And many of us say progressive for who and on what issues. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=269.0s)]
*  Because they take two or three issues that's great [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=273.4s)]
*  and we agree with, but leave us out of the coalition [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=276.52s)]
*  in terms of our interests. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=281.64s)]
*  And I think that the quote we always use [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=283.4s)]
*  is we're not looking for better slave masters. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=286.67999999999995s)]
*  We're looking for freedom. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=289.12s)]
*  It must be a participatory kind of coalition [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=290.52s)]
*  where all of our interests address or none are. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=294.84s)]
*  So like even on a today, like Juneteenth day, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=297.35999999999996s)]
*  how many of the so-called progressive leaders [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=300.08s)]
*  will be with Juneteenth? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=302.12s)]
*  I'm on my way to Junior's Restaurant in Brooklyn [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=303.4s)]
*  to have breakfast with Spike Lee to talk about how [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=305.4s)]
*  we broaden this, how we deal with Haiti just like we [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=308.28000000000003s)]
*  deal with other issues. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=311.4s)]
*  We are not seeing that kind of equal kind of concern [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=312.8s)]
*  by people that call themselves progressive, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=318.88s)]
*  because they're progressive on two or three issues [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=320.92s)]
*  and we're not included in them in the black community. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=323.08s)]
*  So David, your latest piece for Bloomberg [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=325.6s)]
*  is titled Black Men's Shift Toward the GOP [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=327.72s)]
*  May Not Be Fleeting. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=331.0s)]
*  So as we talk about Democrats, they [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=332.28s)]
*  need to talk to their own members [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=333.71999999999997s)]
*  or there are traditionally members of their own base. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=335.35999999999996s)]
*  You're arguing here, and tell us more about it, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=337.4s)]
*  that the inroads that Trump made this time around may last. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=339.44s)]
*  Well, they may and they may not. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=343.56s)]
*  I think what is interesting to understand here [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=344.71999999999997s)]
*  is black men still remain overwhelmingly democratic, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=346.79999999999995s)]
*  but that the shift was significant when [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=349.96s)]
*  you're dealing with elections decided by two points or less. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=353.0s)]
*  That happened nationally. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=355.59999999999997s)]
*  It happened in key swing states. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=356.64s)]
*  And I think what was very interesting about this [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=358.32s)]
*  was that, especially for working class black men, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=361.08s)]
*  they're no different than any other voter. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=365.2s)]
*  And what they have been saying this year, not just [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=367.52s)]
*  the day after the election or before the election, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=370.47999999999996s)]
*  but within the last six, seven weeks in focus groups, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=372.47999999999996s)]
*  is that the economy matters to them, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=376.15999999999997s)]
*  that they think the Democratic Party has overreached [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=379.08s)]
*  and over-focused on social issues and cultural issues [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=382.32s)]
*  that they don't necessarily agree with. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=386.0s)]
*  And that they don't want just appeals to them as black men. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=388.24s)]
*  They want, just like any other voter, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=393.04s)]
*  appeals to them as men who want to make a living [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=395.36s)]
*  and support their family. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=397.88s)]
*  Those are the verbatims in the focus groups. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=398.92s)]
*  And I think it's one of the things that, again, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=402.52s)]
*  we over-complicate this. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=404.92s)]
*  You go to people that have concerns. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=407.64s)]
*  You listen to those concerns. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=410.32s)]
*  And you offer them solutions to those concerns. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=412.32s)]
*  And often, when we look at politicians [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=415.64000000000004s)]
*  that get elected or rise, and we're wondering, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=418.40000000000003s)]
*  how did this flawed candidate, whether it's Donald Trump, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=421.20000000000005s)]
*  or let's say you're a center-left Democrat in New York, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=424.56s)]
*  not progressive, but just center-left, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=428.04s)]
*  and you're wondering how Zoran Mondani is rising. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=430.0s)]
*  And it's usually because people feel like they [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=434.20000000000005s)]
*  have quality of life issues. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=436.76000000000005s)]
*  And I don't know if I agree with what this person is proposing. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=438.48s)]
*  But at least they're proposing something. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=441.12s)]
*  And at least they're showing that they care. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=443.8s)]
*  It's something that Donald Trump has done in the Republican [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=446.40000000000003s)]
*  Party, but also for a lot of independents at times, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=448.68s)]
*  which then gets them to sort of overlook all of his flaws. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=452.6s)]
*  And it's something that we see from time to time with Democrats. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=456.16s)]
*  I would say, finally, when you look [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=460.76s)]
*  at the problems in our politics, voters [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=462.6s)]
*  have a lot of say in this. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=465.52s)]
*  But it would also be helpful, on the one hand, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=466.76s)]
*  to have presidents that could show restraint, not just [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=469.04s)]
*  do things because they either can or can get away with it, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=472.28000000000003s)]
*  and also, ironically, to have a United States Congress that [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=475.76s)]
*  would exert the power the Constitution gives it. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=478.96000000000004s)]
*  We see on both sides of the aisle a parliamentary approach [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=482.08s)]
*  where if my guy's in the White House, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=485.2s)]
*  I'm just not going to say no. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=487.28000000000003s)]
*  They can take power away from us. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=489.08s)]
*  And we're going to let them, because we [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=491.64s)]
*  agree with what they're doing. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=493.40000000000003s)]
*  You need Republicans and Democrats in Congress [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=494.48s)]
*  to tell their own presidents, I know we agree. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=496.40000000000003s)]
*  I would like to get there. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=500.28000000000003s)]
*  We don't have the votes. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=501.64000000000004s)]
*  This belongs to us. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=502.76000000000005s)]
*  You can't do it. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=504.44s)]
*  And nobody wants to do that kind of hard work in Washington. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=505.68s)]
*  David Drucker, thank you very much. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLbSYir6n6o&t=510.28000000000003s)]
