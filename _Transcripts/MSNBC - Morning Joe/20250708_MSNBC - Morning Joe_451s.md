**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [July 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU)
*  NBC News nightly news anchor Tom Yamas is down in central Texas and has more now on [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=0.0s)]
*  the lives lost and some of the remarkable stories of survival there. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=6.32s)]
*  Battling the heat, mud and misery, they're looking for any signs of life. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=13.52s)]
*  Search and rescue teams on the Guadalupe River furiously combing through massive mountains [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  of debris. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=23.16s)]
*  We're in the middle of the river right now and just behind me you can see why this search [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=24.16s)]
*  and recovery is so complicated. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=27.44s)]
*  There are mounds of this mangled steel and tree branches and tree trunks. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=29.74s)]
*  This team is trying to figure out a way inside to see what if anything or anyone is still [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=34.04s)]
*  trapped. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=38.66s)]
*  An all out search for survivors by water, air and horseback. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=40.66s)]
*  All over this area you see homes and trailers and RVs with this giant orange X. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=46.0s)]
*  It means they've been searched. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=50.5s)]
*  We hope whoever lived in here got out because you can see what the river water did to this. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=51.980000000000004s)]
*  Flipping this entire RV over, destroying everything inside. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=56.3s)]
*  Volunteer firefighter Wyatt Kelly has been at this for days. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=60.18s)]
*  What kind of things have you seen out here? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=64.42s)]
*  Unthinkable things. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=67.38s)]
*  There's things that no one ever would have thought they've seen in their lifetime. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=68.38s)]
*  So many people were in their beds fast asleep when the flood waters began to rapidly rise [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=72.06s)]
*  early on the 4th of July. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=77.66s)]
*  The catastrophic flooding killing at least 104 people in six counties including Julian [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=79.86s)]
*  Ryan who was with his mother, kids and wife Christina in their trailer home as the water [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=86.26s)]
*  began to rise. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=91.98s)]
*  My husband started panicking because there was no way for us to get out. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=93.3s)]
*  There was no way for us to get up and so he tried to bust out the window and slice his [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=97.66s)]
*  arm almost off. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=103.26s)]
*  Christina says he quickly began to bleed out. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=104.26s)]
*  What do you remember? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=107.34s)]
*  I'm sorry you had to see your son go through that. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=108.82000000000001s)]
*  I just remember holding him so he wouldn't get swept in the flood. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=110.82000000000001s)]
*  Blood going everywhere. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=117.82000000000001s)]
*  His last words to me was, mama, I love you and you make sure you tell everybody else [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=122.82000000000001s)]
*  I love you. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=132.82s)]
*  Love them. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=133.82s)]
*  The tragedy also playing out at Camp Mystic which says 27 of its campers and counselors [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=135.29999999999998s)]
*  are among the dead and missing. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=140.45999999999998s)]
*  Hallie Thompson's 10-year-old daughter somehow managed to escape from her cabin. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=142.82s)]
*  My daughter grabbed onto a tree and grabbed the hand of her friend and put it on the tree. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=147.7s)]
*  And so one by one those girls came out and found anything they could cling to. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=156.01999999999998s)]
*  Hallie and four other family members were nearby. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=160.45999999999998s)]
*  While their cabin was also surrounded by water, she says their neighbors saved their lives. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=163.18s)]
*  It feels wrong or strange to feel how grateful that I am that we're all alive while we are [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=168.18s)]
*  still waiting for word about friends' daughters and while we have received word of friends' [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=175.18s)]
*  daughters who have died. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=182.1s)]

*  Her dad posting this video of her solo at a Christmas pageant asking prayers for a miracle. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=205.36s)]
*  You can see the flood's devastating toll on the century-old all-girls camp in these images. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=211.36s)]
*  Look at how high the water came into the cabin. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=216.36s)]
*  The flood water's tossing muddy mattresses from bunk beds. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=220.04000000000002s)]
*  This pink trunk with the name L flipped on its side. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=223.04000000000002s)]

*  We don't know everybody who was here. So we don't know everybody who's missing. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=246.72s)]
*  Could be even worse you're saying? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=251.72s)]
*  Yeah, it will be worse because we don't know everybody who's missing. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=253.72s)]

*  This cabin appeared to float away in the flood waters. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=349.76s)]
*  Still, the camp says everyone was able to evacuate to safety. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=353.44s)]
*  We saw like a whole cabin just floating down and that's when we knew like things were getting actually real out there. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=356.44s)]
*  Like we were starting to realize that this was a real natural disaster crisis. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=364.44s)]

*  These are the images of what they saw outside of their windows. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=377.44s)]
*  We couldn't see through the water but we could see the currents moving and it just kept going. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=381.12s)]
*  There was no end to it. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=386.12s)]
*  Their dad came to their rescue along with a neighbor, pulling the girls to safety. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=388.12s)]
*  Brooke, the oldest of the two, looking down at the river and realizing how some girls just like her weren't as lucky. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=392.12s)]
*  When you guys heard about all the people that didn't make it, what was that like? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=399.12s)]
*  You were right here. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BC9QSAGrU&t=403.12s)]
