# Steve Rattner: Tariff effects yet to come, but economists and consumers expect prices to rise
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw)
*  Former Treasury official and Morning Joe economic analyst Steve Ratner. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=0.0s)]
*  Steve, there has indeed been plenty of speculation about how Trump's tariffs [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=4.32s)]
*  will impact the country. So tell us, how does the economy look almost five months into Trump's [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=8.24s)]
*  second term? Yeah, it's interesting, Jonathan. I think all of us predicted that inflation would [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=14.0s)]
*  start to go up as a result of those tariffs. But yesterday there was a report that in fact, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=19.04s)]
*  it has really not yet gone up, well, he's not yet gone up. So the Commerce Department reported that [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=23.52s)]
*  prices for all goods went up by 2.4, I just said Labor Department, 2.4 percent. But for what we [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=28.8s)]
*  call core goods, which is you take out energy and other volatile categories like food, they went up [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=36.24s)]
*  2.8 percent. And that, as you can see, is flat here and just slightly up here. So pretty good news [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=42.4s)]
*  on inflation. Why? I think people feel there are three reasons why we haven't seen the tariffs yet. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  First of all, importers stocked up in anticipation of those tariffs. Secondly, businesses are trying [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=56.56s)]
*  hard not to raise prices, although at some point I think we expect them to. And thirdly, the tariffs [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=62.0s)]
*  have been on and off and paused and so on. And so the effective tariff rate is actually at the moment [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=67.76s)]
*  a good bit lower than what Trump had put in place at the beginning. But economists still expect them [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=72.48s)]
*  to rise by about 3 percent this year, which means faster than that at the end of the year. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  And consumers actually expect them to go up 6.5 percent. Trump, as you know, has been posting on [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=83.12s)]
*  social media about how the Fed has to cut interest rates, the Fed has to cut interest rates. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=89.2s)]
*  The Fed's target is 2 percent. They use a slightly different price index, but close enough. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=93.28s)]
*  2 percent is what the Fed wants to cut interest rates. So there's a tug of war going on right now [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  between Trump and Jerome Powell, the head of the Fed. But let's look at another indication of what [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=103.04s)]
*  impact the tariffs may have this year. The World Bank, a completely dispassionate and neutral [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=109.6s)]
*  organization, put out its semiannual forecast the day before yesterday. And what did they do? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=115.36s)]
*  They took down growth estimates for the U.S. pretty substantially. They had been projecting [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  back in January 2.3 percent. Now they're down at 1.4 percent. It is more than worth noting that 1.4 [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=125.84s)]
*  percent is exactly half of the 2.8 percent that we achieved in the last year of the Biden administration. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=132.72s)]
*  The president who promised to quote revitalize the American economy is actually looking at a [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=139.44s)]
*  growth rate of half of what it was last year. And then the other noteworthy point is we may [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=144.4s)]
*  well be shooting ourselves in the foot because the World Bank only took down its estimates for [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=150.16s)]
*  Europe's growth rate, which is slower than ours, but they took it down by a much smaller share. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=154.96s)]
*  And they didn't change China's growth rate at all. So they feel that China is going to work its way [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=159.84s)]
*  through these tariffs a lot better than we are. That's such an important point about growth rate. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=164.48s)]
*  We'll have more to say about tariffs in just a moment as we read from a Wall Street Journal [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=168.64s)]
*  editorial board take about Trump's tariff policy towards China or lack thereof, really. So, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=173.11999999999998s)]
*  Steve, let's move now to chart two. Labor market slowing down. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=178.55999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. So we had an unemployment report last Friday, and the good news is the economy added [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=183.51999999999998s)]
*  a lot of jobs. The bad news is that the growth rate in jobs have been decelerating. Now, some [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=188.79999999999998s)]
*  of this was inevitable. This is as we were coming out of COVID, this is a very, very high number [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=193.68s)]
*  of jobs that we were adding. And so it's natural that it would have come down. But now for the last [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=198.96s)]
*  several months, the number of jobs we're adding is actually below. This is the pre-pandemic average. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=203.84s)]
*  So this is a kind of normal, stable economy, what we were adding. And this is what we've been adding [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=209.20000000000002s)]
*  over the last 12 months. There's one other interesting point about this, which is not on here, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=214.16s)]
*  which is that 600,000 people dropped out of the labor force last month. That is a very big number. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=218.72s)]
*  We don't know who they are. I don't know who they are. But it's not out of the question. This may [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=224.24s)]
*  have something to do with Trump's immigration policies. But consumers also have noticed the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=228.24s)]
*  fact that the job market is weakening. If you look at the percentage who think jobs are plentiful, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=233.84s)]
*  it's dropped to 32%. It was up here close to 60% as we came out of COVID. That's also obviously [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=239.6s)]
*  unnaturally high. But if you look even before COVID, the number of people who thought they were [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=245.36s)]
*  plentiful was about 45%. The people who think not so plentiful, obviously rising. And the people who [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=250.56s)]
*  say hard to get, 19%, also well above pre-COVID levels. And Steve, another indicator of this [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=256.48s)]
*  economic uncertainty that just seems so pervasive is your third chart. Home buyers simply aren't [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=263.2s)]
*  biting. Yeah, I think when you talk about those poll numbers you were showing earlier, things like [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=267.92s)]
*  the situation with jobs and then with houses play a factor in all this. So what's happened? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=273.04s)]
*  It's really interesting because the number, again, coming out of COVID, ignore all these wild [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=278.88s)]
*  fluctuations, but coming out of COVID, the number of buyers, the number of sellers was kind of in [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=283.36s)]
*  balance. Now look what's happened. The number of sellers has shot up to almost 2 million. The number [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=288.40000000000003s)]
*  of buyers has dropped to 1.5 million. And so you've got almost 500,000 houses sitting on the market [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  waiting for buyers. Now why does that happen? Some of it is clearly economic uncertainty. Again, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=300.88s)]
*  you go back to the Trump economic policies, up, down, backwards, sideways. People do not want to [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=306.0s)]
*  make major purchases when they really have no idea where the country is going. So that's a factor. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=311.2s)]
*  But the other factor is that the, what we call affordability, what an average consumer has to [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=316.71999999999997s)]
*  pay to afford his house has been rising for a good while since we started raising interest rates [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=323.36s)]
*  coming out of COVID. So back here in 21, it was a thousand dollars. Today it's about $2,000. And so [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=328.8s)]
*  that is a significant impact on consumers. But Trump, who again came to office promising he was [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=335.92s)]
*  going to solve all these kinds of problems, what's happened? Since election day, it's gone from $2,100 [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=343.12s)]
*  up to almost $2,200. And on liberation day, it actually took a particularly large jump because [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=349.04s)]
*  the 30-year treasury took a particularly large jump because of the tariffs. So we're going in [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=355.76s)]
*  the wrong direction on housing affordability at the moment, as well as consumers' willingness to [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=361.76s)]
*  make major purchases as we live in this world of economic uncertainty. Yeah, lots of warning signs [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=367.03999999999996s)]
*  there. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpJS7l_biw&t=373.03999999999996s)]
