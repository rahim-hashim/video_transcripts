# 'Vast power of this water': Area official discusses devastation after Texas floods
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [July 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY)
*  Let's bring in Travis County judge Andy Brown. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=0.0s)]
*  He serves as the county's chief administrator and is the director of emergency management [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=3.94s)]
*  for the county. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=10.44s)]
*  Thank you very much for coming on the show very early this morning. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=11.44s)]
*  What is the very latest that you can tell us about the search rescue recovery efforts? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=15.08s)]
*  Yeah, so like in Kerrville, it's still raining here in Austin. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=20.72s)]
*  We're under flash flood watch until 7 p.m. today. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=24.96s)]
*  That's slightly less severe than a warning, but it's still we're not out of it yet. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  We have had a much more localized disaster here in Austin and Travis County, two creeks, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=34.52s)]
*  Sandy Creek and Cow Creek that were very severely hit in a very short amount of time by a lot [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=39.92s)]
*  of water. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=45.92s)]
*  We've seen about 19 inches kind of localized in that part of Travis County, whereas the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=46.92s)]
*  other, you know, South Travis County, the rain has only been an inch or two. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  So this is a storm that was very sudden, very localized. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=57.44s)]
*  And yesterday I went up in our emergency helicopter to kind of look at it from the air. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=62.199999999999996s)]
*  And it's very clear that there is destruction and death along those creeks and along the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=67.24s)]
*  houses and mobile homes that were next to those creeks. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=73.28s)]
*  But then, you know, a quarter mile away from the creeks, nothing at all, no, no destruction [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=76.56s)]
*  at all. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=82.64s)]
*  To me just underscores just the vast power of this water and the power of flash floods. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=83.64s)]
*  You know, Judge, there's been talk through the weekend about possible cuts impacting [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=89.48s)]
*  the Weather Service, impacting rescue efforts. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=96.48s)]
*  Far too early to assign blame. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=100.92s)]
*  It seems to me that every local and county and state and national official are all saying [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  those investigations need to be had in the coming weeks and months. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=109.28s)]
*  But I did note you have actually come out and thank the National Weather Service. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=113.11999999999999s)]
*  You said their forecasts saved lives. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=119.8s)]
*  Tell us about that. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=123.16s)]
*  Yes, so we have a very good relationship, even though, you know, we're a blue county [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=125.19999999999999s)]
*  here in Travis County. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=130.16s)]
*  We have a great relationship with the state of Texas when it comes to emergencies. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=131.12s)]
*  I can't say enough good things about TDEM, the Texas Department of Emergency Management. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=134.51999999999998s)]
*  They're great partners. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=138.92s)]
*  They've given us assets. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=139.92s)]
*  We've sent them assets to take to Kerrville, including our one of our helicopters and others [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=141.92s)]
*  to help people when they were really in the thick of it. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=147.32s)]
*  The National Weather Service has over the years consistently given us warnings that [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=151.64s)]
*  are very important. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=155.79999999999998s)]
*  And frankly, we could not do I could not do what I do without the information that we [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=157.39999999999998s)]
*  get from the Weather Service and from and the help that we get from FEMA. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=162.95999999999998s)]
*  I've been county judge for about five years since November 2020. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=166.95999999999998s)]
*  Three months into my tenure here, we had a winter storm, Uri, which provided snow and [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=171.55999999999997s)]
*  freezing temperatures in the middle of covid, something that we don't see a lot of here [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=179.39999999999998s)]
*  in Austin and Travis County. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=183.39999999999998s)]
*  And frankly, without the money from FEMA, without the assistance from the National Weather [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=185.23999999999998s)]
*  Service, we would have been in a much worse shape. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=189.32s)]
*  So, you know, we do everything that we can locally. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=192.08s)]
*  We do good work here in Travis County. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=197.24s)]
*  We do good work in partnership with TDEM, but we can't do what we do without those federal [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=199.72000000000003s)]
*  assets. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=206.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I saw firsthand growing up in northwest Florida, just how critically [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=207.52s)]
*  important FEMA was. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=213.32000000000002s)]
*  And you're certainly echoing that in your part of the United States. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=214.60000000000002s)]
*  I just want to ask you, how critical is FEMA funding? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=220.76s)]
*  How critical is the National Weather Service funding for you to do your job to protect [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=226.51999999999998s)]
*  lives, to send this sort of warnings to people, whether it's in Texas flash flood alley or [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=231.44s)]
*  whether it's in Hurricane Alley in Florida? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=237.76s)]
*  How important is continued funding of FEMA for you and your constituents and the people [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=240.88s)]
*  whose lives you try to save every day? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=247.8s)]
*  It is absolutely 100% critical. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=252.35999999999999s)]
*  We would not. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=255.16s)]
*  We just do not have the funding, the infrastructure to look at weather in the ways that [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=256.8s)]
*  National Weather Service can. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=262.64s)]
*  It seems that there for our time, at least, were a little slower notifications, you know, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=266.0s)]
*  over the past six months from our local sort of Twitter accounts run by the National Weather [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=273.04s)]
*  Service. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=278.56s)]
*  Those seem to have picked up again, but there was definitely a period where it was pretty [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=281.0s)]
*  uncertain. I don't know where it stands today, but we have to have that information. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=284.88s)]
*  I rely on that every time there is an adverse weather event. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=289.16s)]
*  Look to the National Weather Service, every single emergency call that we have. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=292.56s)]
*  And during times like this, we have several per day where we have the sheriff's department, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=296.56s)]
*  we have EMS, we have everybody on a call or in a room together. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=300.96s)]
*  We always start out with a report out from the National Weather Service. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=305.03999999999996s)]
*  It's absolutely critical to the to the life and safety of people here in Travis County [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=308.64s)]
*  and across Texas. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=314.28s)]
*  All right, Judge Andy Brown, thank you so much and know that we're all thinking and [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=316.56s)]
*  praying for you all in Texas. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=321.84s)]
*  And good luck. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=324.24s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=326.52s)]
*  Thanks for the discussion. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=327.71999999999997s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcVWtQ-DjEY&t=328.59999999999997s)]
