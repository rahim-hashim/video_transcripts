# 'Channel economic anger': How Democrats can reach working class voters
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc)
*  And we are charting a new way forward. Forward to a future with a strong and growing middle [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=0.0s)]
*  class because we know a strong middle class has always been critical to America's success. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=12.0s)]
*  And building that middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=19.84s)]
*  In my plan, incomes will skyrocket, inflation will vanish completely, jobs will come roaring [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=26.8s)]
*  back and the middle class will prosper like never ever before and we're going to do it [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=32.44s)]
*  very rapidly. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=38.32s)]
*  Former Vice President Kamala Harris, President Donald Trump during their 2024 convention [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=40.44s)]
*  speeches last summer, throughout the campaign, both candidates attempted to win over middle [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=44.74s)]
*  class voters. In the end, it was Donald Trump who succeeded in that effort, making significant [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=49.84s)]
*  inroads with working class voters of all races, helping him return to the White House. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  Joining us now, Joan C. Williams. She is law professor at the University of California [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=60.96s)]
*  College of the Law in San Francisco and author of the new book, Outclassed, How the Left [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=65.72s)]
*  Lost the Working Class and How to Win Them Back. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=71.56s)]
*  Professor Williams, thanks for being with us this morning. A fascinating topic, a fascinating [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=75.4s)]
*  look at it in your book. So let's start by diagnosing the problem before you write about [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=79.48s)]
*  how potentially Democrats can solve it. How did we get here where Donald Trump has won [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=84.32s)]
*  over white working class voters? But if you look at the results of the last election, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=90.27999999999999s)]
*  also black and Latino male working class voters. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=94.72s)]
*  Well, you know, non-college people of color shifted, have shifted away from Democrats [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=98.36s)]
*  by 30 points. And young people of color have shifted away even more, 40 points. So Democrats [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=105.64s)]
*  at this point have a problem not just with the white working class, but with many, many [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=114.88s)]
*  people of color in the working class. And you know, it starts out with something very [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=120.12s)]
*  simple. If wages had continued to rise when productivity does, as they did after World [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=124.44s)]
*  War II, wages would be 43 percent higher than they are today. And the wages of college [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=131.38s)]
*  grads have done pretty well since 1989. They've risen 83 percent. But the wages of non-college [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=139.3s)]
*  grads, they have been absolutely flatlined. And as a result, people are really see a fading [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=147.22s)]
*  American dream. I mean, just about every American used to do better than their parents, over [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=154.22s)]
*  90 percent. But now it's only 50 percent. So people are really, really ripping mad. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=159.06s)]
*  And this gets channeled really either into left populism, they're robbing you blind, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=166.34s)]
*  or into right populism, they're looking down on you. And so what Democrats need to do is [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=174.78s)]
*  to channel that economic anger really with a super simple message, which is that hard [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=182.74s)]
*  work used to pay off in America, and it doesn't anymore. And it should. And that's going to [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=190.08s)]
*  reach non-college voters, and that's also going to reach the young, including young [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=196.54s)]
*  college kids who can only get gig work, they can't afford a house, they can't afford child [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=201.98s)]
*  care. Young people shifted away from Democrats by 19 points. So that's the first thing. And [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=209.57999999999998s)]
*  then the second thing is that Democrats need to stop reinforcing the script, they're looking [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=216.1s)]
*  down on you. And that means we ought to stop calling people sort of duped, deplorable attackers [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=223.1s)]
*  of democracy, because that just reinforces that right populist. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=231.26s)]
*  We've been having this conversation, oh God, for decades now. I remember the book What's [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=236.9s)]
*  the Matter with Kansas, right? That was essentially why are people voting against their economic [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=241.9s)]
*  self-interest. Let me push a little bit on this. When Joe Biden came into office, I would [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=245.62s)]
*  argue that he sort of adopted this frame. He was populist Joe, he pursued a bunch of [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=252.02s)]
*  policies meant to help middle class Americans, he called for raising the minimum wage. He [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=257.26s)]
*  believed in this concept of deliverism, which is that if we produce legislation that would [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=263.14s)]
*  have a tangible impact on people, including in red states, they would reward you politically [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=268.42s)]
*  for it. So you get the infrastructure, you get the chips, you get all the stuff, the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=273.66s)]
*  stimulus, and of course it didn't work. So isn't the other explanation here, I'm not [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=276.94s)]
*  saying it's the only explanation, but the other explanation, that a lot of this is cultural, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=283.46000000000004s)]
*  and that Donald Trump, say what you will about the man, is a master at cultural elements [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=287.3s)]
*  of politics. And if that's the case, what do Democrats do about that? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=293.5s)]
*  Well, I mean, starting from the top, I think the sort of accepted storyline that people [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=299.5s)]
*  vote against your self-interest is part of that we're looking down on you narrative. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=304.54s)]
*  People don't vote against their own self-interest. They think that Democrats haven't delivered [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=310.7s)]
*  for them, and Republicans haven't delivered for them for a very simple reason. We kind [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=315.02s)]
*  of haven't delivered for them. The American middle class is fragile and failing, and we [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=319.41999999999996s)]
*  see it all over the country, and it's concentrated. There's been increased inequality between [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=325.7s)]
*  people, but also increased inequality between regions. And so you see that ocean of red [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=331.53999999999996s)]
*  in the middle of the country. That's the result of kind of a neoliberal ideal that [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=338.78s)]
*  channeled about over 90 percent of the growth to large metropolitan areas. But you're right. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=344.76s)]
*  It's not just economics. And one of the things that Biden did, he tried to address this for [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=352.44s)]
*  sure, and his focus was on blue collar jobs. Now, blue collar jobs are a piece of the puzzle. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=357.59999999999997s)]
*  They're not all of the puzzle. They're also people in pink collar jobs who can hardly [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=368.3s)]
*  support a family, people in routine, white collar jobs like the tire salesman. So blue [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=372.6s)]
*  collar jobs, focusing exclusively on blue collar jobs has a couple of problems. Number [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=378.26000000000005s)]
*  one, it's hard to produce them, and it takes a long time. Deliverism, it didn't deliver. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=382.92s)]
*  But you're also right that there's this cultural piece, and you're also right that Donald Trump [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=390.6s)]
*  is an absolute genius in culturally connecting with non-college voters. And part of what [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=395.86s)]
*  we do, we see it in the news today. I mean, we have Elon Musk and we have Donald Trump, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=403.74s)]
*  and they both have what we call in the gender biz a bad but bold masculinity. They're the [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=410.94s)]
*  man. And of course, each one of them is the man. And now the man is, you know, they're [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=418.94s)]
*  fighting to see who's really the man. That is a blue collar cultural style. And very [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=424.98s)]
*  often, Democrats come across with a college grad cultural style, sort of like, I'm an [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=432.18s)]
*  intelligent person talking to you, another intelligent person. And what non-college grads [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=438.94s)]
*  hear is that they're kind of not an important audience because they have a different style. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=446.46s)]
*  It's very much direct, concrete. How are you going to improve their everyday life? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=452.1s)]
*  I think of Gretchen Whitmer, fix the damn roads. Now, that is a very effective cultural style. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=456.98s)]
*  So Gretchen Whitmer, you know, Josh Shapiro kind of has some of that. Is this a personality [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=462.98s)]
*  issue? I mean, is this Democrats not finding the right messenger? Or is it deeper than [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=470.02000000000004s)]
*  that? Because, you know, Democrats are increasingly the college-educated party, right? And also [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=477.26s)]
*  the party that believes in policy in a way that, frankly, the Republican Party doesn't [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=483.78s)]
*  believe in anymore. So tell me, is it personality or is it something else? And how do you get [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=492.34s)]
*  that something else? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=501.82s)]
*  I don't think it's personality. I think the Democrats have plenty of talent and plenty [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=503.58s)]
*  of talent who knows how to talk to people. I think of Marie-Gloucester Pérez, and this [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=508.94s)]
*  is how she approaches climate change. She doesn't call people climate deniers. What [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=513.6999999999999s)]
*  is that? It reinforces the right populist script that we're looking down on people. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=518.02s)]
*  That doesn't work. She says, you know, my husband and I, we own an auto body shop. If [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=523.02s)]
*  it's 116 degrees outside, we can't work. That is a perfect way to talk about climate [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=528.58s)]
*  change. So I think that many in the Democratic Party, too many of us, because I'm a Democrat, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=534.26s)]
*  are thinking about we're college grads and we think about talking to other college grads [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=543.6600000000001s)]
*  in ways that communicate, again, I'm an intelligent person, talking about policy matters with [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=548.98s)]
*  you, an intelligent person. I think we have to think about the fact that in the sort of [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=555.8199999999999s)]
*  missing middle, blue collar, we often call it, they have a different cultural style because [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=562.98s)]
*  they have different lives. Blue collar rhetoric, blue collar values, blue collar speech patterns, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=568.78s)]
*  they fit into blue collar lives. And very often, educated people in the United States [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=575.8399999999999s)]
*  have forgotten, you know, I also do a lot of DEI work, so they're forgotten, they're [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=581.74s)]
*  privileged. And privileged talk, privileged values, it fits in privileged lives. It doesn't [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=587.22s)]
*  fit in blue collar lives. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=592.82s)]
*  It's a fascinating conversation. We've just scratched the surface. We'd love to have [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=594.98s)]
*  you back. The new book, Outclassed, How the Left Lost the Working Class and How to Win [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=599.86s)]
*  Them Back is on sale now. Author and professor Joan C. Williams. Joan, thanks so much for [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=605.26s)]
*  being here. We appreciate it. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVtQQIXLrwc&t=610.7s)]
