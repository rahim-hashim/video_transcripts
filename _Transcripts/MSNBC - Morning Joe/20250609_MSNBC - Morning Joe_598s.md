*  It is Monday, June 9th, and we have a lot to get to. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=117.2s)]
*  Our panel this morning, co-host of our fourth hour, contributing writer at the Atlantic, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=120.6s)]
*  Jonathan Lemire, U.S. special correspondent for BBC News, and the host of the rest is [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=124.32s)]
*  Politics Podcast. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=129.4s)]
*  Patty Kay is with us. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=131.28s)]
*  Senior writer at the Dispatch, David Drucker is here. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=133.2s)]
*  He's also a Bloomberg columnist and co-founder and CEO of Axios, Jim Van De Heide, joins [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=135.88s)]
*  us. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=142.32s)]
*  So we're entering day four of protests in Los Angeles as demonstrators continue to clash [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=143.32s)]
*  with law enforcement. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=149.64s)]
*  The protests began on Friday in response to immigration raids. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=151.12s)]
*  ICE says it arrested 118 people after executing search warrants at multiple locations last [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=155.68s)]
*  week, 44 of whom were taken into custody during Friday's operation. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=163.4s)]
*  On Saturday, California Governor Gavin Newsom said the situation was under control, this [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=168.8s)]
*  despite clashes being reported. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=173.84s)]
*  Shortly after, President Trump deployed the National Guard, sending 2,000 members there [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=176.64000000000001s)]
*  to intervene. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=184.52s)]
*  It's the first time in decades this has been done without a request from the governor. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=185.76000000000002s)]
*  And now, Northern Command says 500 Marines are ready to deploy if the situation gets [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=192.24s)]
*  worse. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=200.0s)]
*  Police have been using tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowds. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=201.0s)]
*  Earlier demonstrators spilled onto the 101 freeway, causing it to partially shut down. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=205.48000000000002s)]
*  We say at least 56 people have been arrested so far. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=211.64s)]
*  Let's bring in NBC News political and national correspondent Jacob Soboroff, live from Los [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=215.83999999999997s)]
*  Angeles, and NBC News senior Homeland Security correspondent Julia Ainsley. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=220.45999999999998s)]
*  Now, Jacob, you've been on this developing story all weekend. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=225.35999999999999s)]
*  We heard some of your interviews with Governor Gavin Newsom and the border czar Tom Holman. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=230.17999999999998s)]
*  What is the latest so far at this hour? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=235.27999999999997s)]
*  Well, Mika, I want to back up to Friday and talk about how unusual the situation is here [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=238.32s)]
*  in Los Angeles. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=243.76s)]
*  On Friday morning here in the LA Bureau of NBC News, the first reports started coming [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=245.0s)]
*  in of ICE raids across Los Angeles. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=249.84s)]
*  And local news had aerial footage of bearcats or tactical style vehicles going through the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=252.28s)]
*  streets of Los Angeles. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=257.76s)]
*  And that's when those first melees broke out. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=259.2s)]
*  On Friday night, there was a peaceful protest that then did turn in to a bit of a skirmish [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=261.53999999999996s)]
*  between federal agents and people who are out there protesting. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=265.64s)]
*  And that's that scene repeated itself over the course of the next several days, with, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=269.84s)]
*  of course, the president against the wishes of Governor Newsom bringing in the National [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=273.64s)]
*  Guard, exercising Title 10 of the U.S. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=277.76s)]
*  Code to bring in the National Guard to Los Angeles to protect it. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=279.92s)]
*  It's very specific federal property and federal agents that are carrying out these raids. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=283.04s)]
*  The reason I say it's unusual is that this is not and Julia can talk about this as well [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=287.8s)]
*  or better than I can. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=292.0s)]
*  This is not the ordinary way that ICE has operated historically in Los Angeles or across [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=293.36s)]
*  the country. But under this, you know, stated mass deportation program of the Trump administration, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=298.4s)]
*  you are seeing raids at places like Home Depot's where day laborers are. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=302.68s)]
*  You know, those were not targeted enforcement areas on a wide scale under Democratic nor [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=306.6s)]
*  Republican administrations previously. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=312.92s)]
*  And has so many people on edge here in Los Angeles because we're a majority minority [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=314.68s)]
*  city. There are 50 percent plus people of color in Los Angeles, including many Latinos, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=320.47999999999996s)]
*  including maybe as many as a million undocumented people here in the Los Angeles area. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=324.8s)]
*  So it is devolved into this feud, which Governor Newsom says didn't need to happen. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=329.88s)]
*  Mayor Bassett didn't need to happen. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=334.03999999999996s)]
*  They do not want the National Guard here. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=335.64s)]
*  And before the National Guard here was here, quite frankly, these types of mailings were [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=337.59999999999997s)]
*  not happening on the streets of Los Angeles. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=343.24s)]
*  First, Tom Homan told me that he wasn't ruling out, as you saw at the beginning of the [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=345.71999999999997s)]
*  show, arresting Governor Newsom, nor Mayor Karen Bass if they got in between the ICE [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=349.84s)]
*  enforcement operations and the federal agents. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=355.59999999999997s)]
*  And then last night in the Emergency Operations Center, I spent some time with Governor [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=359.96s)]
*  Newsom as he monitored the situation here and I asked him about what Tom Homan had said [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=363.15999999999997s)]
*  about arresting him. I want to play a little bit more of that sound for you right now. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=368.08s)]
*  Mika, watch this. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=371.84s)]
*  He's a tough guy, wasn't he? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=374.52s)]
*  Do that. He knows where to find me. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=375.71999999999997s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=377.47999999999996s)]
*  Lay your hands off four-year-old girls that are trying to get educated. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=379.28s)]
*  Lay your hands off these poor people. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=383.47999999999996s)]
*  They're just trying to get, live their lives, man. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=385.2s)]
*  Trying to live their lives, paying their taxes. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=387.91999999999996s)]
*  Been here 10 years. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=389.52s)]
*  The fear, the horror. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=391.03999999999996s)]
*  The hell is this guy? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=393.52s)]
*  Come after me. Arrest me. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=394.84s)]
*  Let's just get it over with. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=396.03999999999996s)]
*  Tough guy. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=397.4s)]
*  You know, I don't give a damn. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=398.96s)]
*  But I care about my community. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=401.08s)]
*  I care about this community. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=402.55999999999995s)]
*  The hell are they doing? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=404.44s)]
*  These guys need to grow up. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=405.84s)]
*  They need to stop. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=407.0s)]
*  And we need to push back. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=408.88s)]
*  And I'm sorry to be so clear, but that kind of bloviating is exhausting. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=410.28s)]
*  So Tom, arrest me. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=414.48s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=416.28s)]
*  So tough stuff from the governor of California and caught in between this war of words, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=419.12s)]
*  which is a feud that's familiar to so many people who have covered the relationship [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=423.12s)]
*  between Gavin Newsom and Donald Trump, are families, many mixed status families that live [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=426.71999999999997s)]
*  here in Los Angeles, meaning an undocumented, maybe parent or relative and a young child [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=432.20000000000005s)]
*  or even a teenager or somebody older than that who was born here in this country. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=438.0s)]
*  The thing is, President Trump and Gavin Newsom have been talking behind the scenes, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=444.16s)]
*  at least since the beginning of this began. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=449.32000000000005s)]
*  I asked him about a phone conversation that they had on Friday night, and he said that [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=450.88s)]
*  they had a relatively cordial conversation and this didn't come up. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=455.68s)]
*  I want to give you a little bit more of what Governor Newsom said about his conversation [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=458.12s)]
*  on Friday night, Mika, with the president. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=462.08s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=463.76s)]
*  Under his executive order, specifically notes and under what the DOD did is they had to [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=466.8s)]
*  coordinate with the governor of the state. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=472.35999999999996s)]
*  They never coordinate with the governor of the state. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=474.52s)]
*  We talked for almost 20 minutes and barely this issue never came up. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=476.24s)]
*  I kept trying to talk about L.A. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=481.0s)]
*  Want to talk about all these other issues. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=482.47999999999996s)]
*  We had a very decent conversation. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=483.88s)]
*  When was this? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=485.4s)]
*  This was late Friday night, about one thirty plus his time after the protests had started [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=485.96s)]
*  after the protests. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=490.6s)]
*  And he never once brought up the National Guard. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=491.48s)]
*  He's a stone cold liar. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=493.12s)]
*  He said he did. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=494.20000000000005s)]
*  Stone cold liar. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=495.12s)]
*  Never did. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=497.48s)]
*  Was a very civil conversation. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=498.72s)]
*  I've always wanted to approach engagement with the president of the United States in a [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=500.04s)]
*  respectful and responsible way. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=504.76000000000005s)]
*  But there's no working with the president. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=506.92s)]
*  There's only working for him. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=509.12s)]
*  And I will never work for Donald Trump. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=510.72s)]
*  Just I mean, where's your decency, Mr. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=513.9200000000001s)]
*  President? Stop rescind this order. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=515.8000000000001s)]
*  It's illegal and unconstitutional. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=518.5600000000001s)]
*  And I said it. I'll say it again. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=519.96s)]
*  It's immoral. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=521.12s)]
*  You're creating the conditions that you claim you're solving and you're not. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=522.6s)]
*  And you're putting real people's lives at risk. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=526.48s)]
*  So that's what this is really all about. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=530.1600000000001s)]
*  Putting real people's lives at risk. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=531.6800000000001s)]
*  And, you know, you've heard reports that there are riots on the streets of Los Angeles. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=534.12s)]
*  There are certainly some there has been civil unrest, reports of looting overnight. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=538.44s)]
*  But on a wide scale, that is not what's happening across the city of Los Angeles. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=543.5600000000001s)]
*  And I think it's important to emphasize that this is also not what was happening before [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=547.88s)]
*  the National Guard came to Los Angeles. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=552.32s)]
*  That's the point that Governor Newsom is making. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=555.08s)]
*  And that's why he has asked and said this morning he's filing a lawsuit, Mika, to get [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=556.8000000000001s)]
*  that authority back from the president of the United States and remove the deployment of [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=562.44s)]
*  the National Guard on the streets of Los Angeles, because he's saying that's what's [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=566.6s)]
*  inflammatory here. And caught in the crosshairs are these migrant residents of Los Angeles, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=569.08s)]
*  many of whom have been here most of their entire lives. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=575.08s)]
*  And I think that's what's happening in the city of Los Angeles. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMW8J-0qX3k&t=577.84s)]
