# Trump says he decides what 'America First' means: The Atlantic
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0)
*  Welcome back. What does America First mean? Well, according to President Trump, it means [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=0.0s)]
*  whatever he says it does. In a new piece for The Atlantic, staff writer Michael Scherer [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=6.4s)]
*  recounts his phone interview with the president, in which Trump brushes off rare criticism [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=11.52s)]
*  from MAGA supporters of his seeming willingness to get involved in Israel's attacks on Iran. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=17.68s)]
*  Michael joins us now along with former Democratic Congressman Connor Lamb of Pennsylvania. He's [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=24.6s)]
*  a Marine veteran and president of the National Action Network and host of MSNBC's Politics [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  Nation, Reverend Al Sharpton. Good to have you all with us. Michael, let's talk about [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=36.96s)]
*  that conversation you had with the president. Does it matter to him? Does he seem to be [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=42.24s)]
*  splitting up his base? You know, the measure of a politician is how well he can get contradictory [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=48.96s)]
*  parts of a coalition together to believe in him. And the challenge of governing is when [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  you start governing, you have to make choices. And this is clearly a key moment for his coalition. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=60.28s)]
*  And I think it has bothered him. I mean, he's spoken out to me on Saturday. He was speaking [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=65.76s)]
*  about it a couple times yesterday in Canada. He's tweeted about Tucker Carlson recently. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=71.48s)]
*  I think he feels very strongly, and he's been consistent for weeks now, that Iran cannot [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=76.72000000000001s)]
*  have a nuclear weapon and that the option of military force by the U.S. has to be on [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=82.72000000000001s)]
*  the table. There is a significant part of his base that sees in that statement a return [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=88.08000000000001s)]
*  to sort of the Bush doctrine of the early 2000s. I mean, that's where Tucker Carlson [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=94.84s)]
*  is coming from. He felt very burned by the invasion of Iraq. And we're going to see how [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=98.56s)]
*  that plays out over the coming days. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=103.2s)]
*  Correct me if I'm wrong, Michael. It seems like he's always been in line with his base, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=106.12s)]
*  unless I'm forgetting something. Is this the first time he's really pushing back in a way [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=113.12s)]
*  that's significant? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=118.44s)]
*  Tucker? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=120.52000000000001s)]
*  No, Trump. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=121.76s)]
*  Oh, no. I think Trump has taken on his critics in his party his whole career. I mean, what [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=124.04s)]
*  is different is Tucker Carlson is actually basically an intimate of President Trump. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=131.2s)]
*  After the election last year, Tucker was down at Mar-a-Lago for weeks. He's very close to [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=135.92s)]
*  the president's son. He's very close to Robert F. Kennedy. He was part of conversations about [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=140.32s)]
*  the formation of the government. If you go back to his time at Fox and after he left [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=145.68s)]
*  Fox, he was the most Trumpist of the people there. But again, the Trump message has always [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=150.12s)]
*  included more people than any one policy can contain. If you look at tariffs and lowering [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=157.0s)]
*  taxes or anything along those lines. So this is a breaking point. I mean, Tucker was on [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=163.0s)]
*  a different web show yesterday saying that if Trump goes through with this, this could [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=170.4s)]
*  be the end of his presidency. So the stakes are pretty high. And these are very strong [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=176.48s)]
*  words being exchanged between the two men. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=181.0s)]
*  Yeah, certainly. Sharpe divides. Tucker Carlson away with Steve Bannon, Mark Levin, and others [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=183.0s)]
*  on the other side. Congressman Lam, former Congressman Lam, your state obviously is one [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=188.64s)]
*  that has gone for Donald Trump twice, Pennsylvania. It is one where certainly it's a lot of veterans [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=193.92s)]
*  in that state, people who feel very deeply about what happened in Afghanistan and Iraq. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=199.04s)]
*  Give us your take here as to, you know, you know, I mean, you've surrounded by Republicans [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=203.84s)]
*  all the time. Like this, this Trump base, how fragile it may be on this issue, it is [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=209.08s)]
*  something that does feel like could be really divisive. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=213.08s)]
*  Absolutely. I mean, everyone lived through two wars that went on far longer than they [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=215.88000000000002s)]
*  should have. We sent a lot of our sons and daughters to serve in those wars. And I think [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=220.32000000000002s)]
*  the problem is Trump makes everything about his ego and about him. And so there's a big [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=224.92000000000002s)]
*  fear that first of all, he's going to be manipulated into stumbling into a war just because he [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=230.60000000000002s)]
*  wants to feel tough or, you know, somehow he feels threatened. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=234.84s)]
*  And then, you know, I think we also have the issue of what is the end game? You know, Iran [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=238.8s)]
*  is a country of 90 million people with an enormous military that's very sophisticated. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=242.24s)]
*  So are all the working class kids in Pennsylvania going to be sent there for another 15 or 20 [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=246.72s)]
*  years? He has not prepared the public for this. So I think, you know, people in states [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=251.8s)]
*  like Pennsylvania would be more than willing to sign up to support a president that makes [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=256.04s)]
*  the case about our interests. But if it's just about his ego and how he's feeling on [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=260.3s)]
*  a given day, people are not going to support it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=264.32s)]
*  So, Rev, you've obviously known Donald Trump for a long time and followed his moves closely. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=266.2s)]
*  He is someone who reflexively, his instinct seems to be he's pretty opposed to war. He [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=272.92s)]
*  has had occasions where he has backed down using the Lib 4. He's called in some strikes [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=277.0s)]
*  now and then. He's been saying repeatedly he wants this war to end. He wants to go to [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=281.68s)]
*  the negotiating table. But he's getting a lot, to the congressman's point, a lot of [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=285.96s)]
*  people in his ear say no, including Lindsey Graham, from what we played a few moments [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=290.56s)]
*  ago, say now is the time, you know, at minimum enable Israel to go finish off this regime [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=294.72s)]
*  once and for all or maybe even get U.S. directly involved. Where do you think he's, how does [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=300.2s)]
*  he, knowing him, how does he assess this conundrum? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=306.36s)]
*  I think he assesses it as he does everything else to where it plays to him, to show his [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=309.24s)]
*  power, to show that I was able to do what no one else could do. Remember now he said [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=316.28s)]
*  I would solve Ukraine first day in office. I will do this, I will do that. So he is really [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=321.28s)]
*  looking to say to the world I brought some peace here, not that he escalated because [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=327.59999999999997s)]
*  his ego wants a Nobel Prize or something of the sort. And the fact that now you have former [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=333.79999999999995s)]
*  allies like Tucker Carlson all the way across to the Steve Bannon crowd questioning him, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=340.08s)]
*  I don't think it rattles him. I think it makes him angry. He just went through a battle with [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=347.56s)]
*  Elon Musk. He's not one that wants to be questioned by anybody. Oh, you missed the parade for [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=351.71999999999997s)]
*  his birthday? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=357.59999999999997s)]
*  Right, right. That walks you on the weekend. And to your point, Marjorie Taylor Greene, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=358.59999999999997s)]
*  a congresswoman from Georgia who's, you know, as maga as it gets, she has said it would [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=363.36s)]
*  be a betrayal of America first if the U.S. were to be truly involved with Iran. We're [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=367.64s)]
*  going to come back to this story, but we want to turn now to the suspect in the Minnesota [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=372.91999999999996s)]
*  lawmaker shootings who will now face federal charges on top of the murder and attempted [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=376.91999999999996s)]
*  murder charges from that state. More charges against Vance Belter are likely to come as [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=382.44s)]
*  officials paint a picture of a man who the acting district attorney of Minnesota said [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=387.96s)]
*  stalked his victims like prey. In Belter's first court appearance yesterday, a judge [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=393.91999999999996s)]
*  set bail at five million dollars for the state charges. Meanwhile, court documents give new [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=399.91999999999996s)]
*  details on the timeline of the weekend rampage. These newly released images allegedly show [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=404.88s)]
*  Belter at the door of state Senator John Hoffman's home wearing a face mask, tactical vest, and [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=411.2s)]
*  body armor. Prosecutors say he identified himself as police before he began shooting. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=418.36s)]
*  He then reportedly fled in an SUV that was retrofitted with emergency lights and a fake [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=424.24s)]
*  license plate that reads simply, police. The suspect allegedly visited the homes of two [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=428.47999999999996s)]
*  other lawmakers that night but was not able to attack. When he reached the home of state [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=433.71999999999997s)]
*  representative Melissa Hortman, the police were there doing a wellness check, but he [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=438.88s)]
*  was still able to kill her and her husband. Congressman Lam, you obviously served in Congress [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=443.52s)]
*  for a while, been in the public eye. It is a disturbing reality that violent rhetoric [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=450.64s)]
*  and, frankly, acts of violence are becoming more and more part of the American political [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=456.48s)]
*  life and lawmakers, judges, those who are in the public service have more reason to [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=462.8s)]
*  be afraid. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=470.34s)]
*  No, that's right. I think if you look back to January 6th, I remember sitting there that [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=471.8s)]
*  day and just thinking the only reason these people are at the Capitol, the only reason [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=476.52s)]
*  they're storming their way inside is because Donald Trump has been lying to them about [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=480.48s)]
*  the election for about three months. I remember thinking, what's that going to look like in [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=484.2s)]
*  three years? The compounding effect of that over time amplified with these algorithms [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=489.44s)]
*  of social media. I think we're seeing it. People are just crying out to have a leader [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=494.62s)]
*  come out and say, we need to be responsible for our words and turn down the temperature. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=500.92s)]
*  Not only will Trump not do it, he encourages it to get worse and worse. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=505.36s)]
*  Yeah, and in fact, Rev, the president flying back from Calgary last night was asked if [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=508.32000000000005s)]
*  he would call Minnesota Governor Walz to express condolences about what's happened to his state [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=512.9200000000001s)]
*  or even to check in on the investigation, and Trump dismissed it, saying, why would [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=518.88s)]
*  I want to talk to him? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=521.98s)]
*  And that is the point, that he is still so caught up in his narrow ego, which those of [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=523.08s)]
*  us that knew him in New York, he always has been like that. He wanted to plaster his name [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=529.5600000000001s)]
*  on every building that he was managing. This is not anything new. So I think to show any [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=533.8000000000001s)]
*  kind of sensitivity to him is weakness. It would have been strength, not weakness, to [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=540.8000000000001s)]
*  call the governor who was as vice president running against you. And it would have also [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=546.44s)]
*  put him on a higher level in terms of the perception of his presidency. He keeps playing [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=552.08s)]
*  lowball because that's just the kind of person that he is, and his ego reinforces that. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=558.42s)]
*  We, of course, will bring you any other developments in the investigation in the days ahead. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=564.5s)]
*  Former Democratic Congressman Conor Lamb, thank you so much. Starfighter of the Atlantic, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=570.0999999999999s)]
*  Michael Scherrer, thank you as well. His new piece, available to read online right now. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=573.38s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZobGmoWQ8d0&t=588.42s)]
