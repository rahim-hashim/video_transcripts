# U.S. added 139,000 jobs in May as the labor market steadily cools
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU)
*  We have a lot to get to this hour. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=0.0s)]
*  We're going to start with breaking economic news. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=1.6s)]
*  The May jobs report was released just moments ago, and it showed that the U.S. added 139,000 [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=4.08s)]
*  jobs in May, topping expectations. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=10.44s)]
*  The unemployment rate remains unchanged at 4.2 percent. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=13.0s)]
*  For more, let's bring in CNBC's Dom Chiu. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=18.56s)]
*  Dom, give us a sense, which lessons should we glean from these numbers? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=21.36s)]
*  What do they tell us about the state of the economy right now? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  Sure, Jonathan. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=29.4s)]
*  So this report is being scrutinized for any signs that our current tariff and trade war [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=30.4s)]
*  is leading to a slowdown in the economy and perhaps even some early signs of a more profound [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=35.4s)]
*  weakening of the jobs market overall. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=40.239999999999995s)]
*  Now, if, hypothetically, companies are cutting costs and slowing activity down over all of [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=42.599999999999994s)]
*  the economic and trade uncertainty, this could be an early read on that jobs data. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=48.44s)]
*  And yes, maybe we do see some of slowdown. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=53.68s)]
*  So job activity actually, yes, did slow down, but it's still positive and it came in better [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=56.12s)]
*  than what was forecast for. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=61.3s)]
*  That April number that you just kind of alluded to before, then the April one from the month [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=63.059999999999995s)]
*  prior, was also revised lower to a gain of 147,000 jobs. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=67.6s)]
*  So the May number is a slowdown from an already downwardly revised figure for the prior month. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=72.96s)]
*  Unemployment, as you point out, holding steady. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=79.52s)]
*  The other component that is always getting some attention these days is on the wage growth, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=81.84s)]
*  average hourly earnings, which actually showed an acceleration in wage gains on a year-over-year [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=87.12s)]
*  basis. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=92.76s)]
*  They were up 3.9% year-over-year compared to the year-over-year gain of 3.7% that we [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=93.76s)]
*  saw in the month of April. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=100.4s)]
*  Now, on balance, what you're seeing is stocks generally move higher and U.S. government [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=101.88s)]
*  bond prices falling, which is leading to interest rates going higher. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=107.32000000000001s)]
*  That's all part and parcel to what happens when economic growth is still the mainline [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=111.56s)]
*  story, so that's something to keep an eye on. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=115.84s)]
*  But that concern about the jobs market involves a lot of the different parts of the current [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=117.84s)]
*  economic condition that we're seeing. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=121.84s)]
*  Tariffs and trade policy are at the heart of it. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  The jobs market has remained relatively strong despite all of the uncertainty that we are [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=126.92s)]
*  seeing, especially with China. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=131.6s)]
*  Now, some experts are already taking note of the potential early signs of labor market [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=133.12s)]
*  weakness in places like the data on unemployment. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=137.82s)]
*  Investors and investors are now trying to handicap just how optimistic they can get [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=141.54s)]
*  now that President Trump and China's President Xi Jinping have had their highly anticipated [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=145.6s)]
*  phone call. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=151.29999999999998s)]
*  The leaders of the world's two biggest economies had their chat just yesterday with Trump calling [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=152.5s)]
*  the status of trade talks, quote, very good after the call and Xi Jinping saying that [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=156.62s)]
*  the two sides should work towards a win-win solution. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=161.62s)]
*  Trump also then posted that Xi invited him and First Lady Melania Trump to visit China [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=165.06s)]
*  and that he made the same invitation to Xi. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=170.94s)]
*  So, Jonathan, whether that does anything to reassure Wall Street remains to be seen, but [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=173.38s)]
*  generally we're still about 3 or 4 percent away from record highs. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=180.42s)]
*  So that's something to keep a close eye on, Jonathan. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=184.11999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, Trump wanted that call with Xi Jinping for a while, finally got it. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=185.78s)]
*  No dates scheduled yet for possible visits. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=189.92s)]
*  And let's remember, though, there was an agreement to keep talking, no trade deal yet, between [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=191.98s)]
*  the U.S. and China. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXSsM4WmHUU&t=196.85999999999999s)]
