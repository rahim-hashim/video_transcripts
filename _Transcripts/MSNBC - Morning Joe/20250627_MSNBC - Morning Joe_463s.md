# 'Trying to suppress facts': House Dem rebukes WH for limiting intelligence sharing
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730)
*  We have a major blow alongside our friends in Israel against Iran's nuclear program that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=0.0s)]
*  is going to make America safer, our friends in the region safer, and protect the world [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  from the risk of an Iranian nuclear weapon for years. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=11.620000000000001s)]
*  President Trump said that the nuclear stockpile was completely and totally obliterated. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=16.06s)]
*  I did not receive an adequate answer to that question. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=23.06s)]
*  We have to be careful what's classified, what I can talk about, and what they said. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=27.02s)]
*  This is my assessment based upon everything I know. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=30.1s)]
*  I think they're setback years. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=32.54s)]
*  My personal view based on what I heard is Iran continues to be a threat. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=34.2s)]
*  So some mixed reaction there from senators following their classified briefing yesterday [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=44.54s)]
*  on last weekend's U.S. military operation in Iran. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=49.22s)]
*  In less than two hours, the White House will receive its own classified briefing on that [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=52.76s)]
*  mission nearly a week after it happened. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=57.8s)]
*  Joining us now, the House will receive, joining us now is Congressman Raja Krishnamurthy of [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=61.12s)]
*  Illinois. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=65.72s)]
*  He serves on the House Intel and Oversight Committees. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=66.86s)]
*  Congressman, what are the outstanding issues that you would like resolved in that briefing? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=71.2s)]
*  What are the things you feel you still don't know, the specifics of what you still don't [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=76.58s)]
*  know? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=80.32s)]
*  Well, I think we don't know where hundreds of kilograms of enriched uranium is. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=81.88s)]
*  We don't know about other unaccounted for facilities that could weaponize that uranium. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=87.11999999999999s)]
*  I think what people agree on is we cannot have Iran with a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  We must end the nuclear weapons program. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=97.82s)]
*  But what appears to be outside of dispute today is that that program has not been ended. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=100.44s)]
*  And therefore, in my humble belief, we have to go to the negotiating table and end it [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=106.92s)]
*  because as we saw last week, a military solution is not sufficient to end that program. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=111.72s)]
*  Congressman, is there a possibility that we're dealing in semantics here? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=117.62s)]
*  The president muddied the waters by using this word obliterated, which has then been [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=122.06s)]
*  picked up by the Secretary of Defense. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=125.9s)]
*  But it does look like the subsequent intelligence reporting not just from the United States, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=128.38s)]
*  but from the IAEA, from the Israelis, other international sources does show that there [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=133.54s)]
*  was significant damage done to the Iranian nuclear capacity. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=138.57999999999998s)]
*  So are we sort of picking at hairs a little bit at this stage? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=145.66s)]
*  Does it look like that initial low confidence report may have underestimated the damage [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=149.94s)]
*  that was done to the sites? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=155.88s)]
*  Not necessarily. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=158.89999999999998s)]
*  I think we could have multiple things true at the same time. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=159.89999999999998s)]
*  Many of those facilities that are above ground were severely damaged. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=163.98s)]
*  You might even say they might have been obliterated. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=167.14s)]
*  However, the uranium that was stored there, hundreds of kilograms, has not been accounted [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=169.66s)]
*  for. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=175.42s)]
*  It's 60 percent enriched. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=176.42s)]
*  To get to weapons grade, it needs to be enriched to 90 percent, but it's still a dangerous [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=178.01999999999998s)]
*  enrichment level. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=183.18s)]
*  And then secondly, we don't know about the underground facilities. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=184.7s)]
*  We don't know about unreported facilities or unaccounted for facilities as well that [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=187.94s)]
*  are scattered around the country. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=193.08s)]
*  So Congressman, following up on this as we await the briefing in a few hours' time, what [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=195.52s)]
*  are your concerns, not just as we discussed earlier, that the administration might be [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=200.32000000000002s)]
*  limiting the intelligence sharing, but rather shaping the intelligence sharing, particularly [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  pushing pressure from the White House on various agencies to frankly produce intel that Donald [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=209.56s)]
*  Trump would like? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=216.04000000000002s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=217.04000000000002s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=218.12s)]
*  I think there are two concerns there. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=219.12s)]
*  One, not sharing information with the legislative branch. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=220.12s)]
*  And let's just be clear why this was required in the first place. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=224.1s)]
*  Back in the early 1970s, there were secret wars, secret assassinations, domestic surveillance [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=228.79999999999998s)]
*  that led to statutes that require the executive branch to share intelligence information with [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=234.84s)]
*  the, with Congress in order for us to do our oversight. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=242.04s)]
*  When we aren't able to do our oversight, bad things happen. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=245.84s)]
*  And that's why we're concerned here. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=249.32s)]
*  Secondly, you're absolutely right. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=251.04s)]
*  We're very concerned that people within the intelligence community might be pressured, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=252.6s)]
*  might be influenced unduly so to shape intelligence reports to match whatever President Trump [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=256.84000000000003s)]
*  wants. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=264.04s)]
*  Now we've gone down this road before. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=265.04s)]
*  Remember in 2003 through 2005 with regard to weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, unfortunately [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=266.56s)]
*  at that point the intelligence community was also pressured to deliver something consistent [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=273.82000000000005s)]
*  with what George W. Bush wanted. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=278.5s)]
*  That led to a horrible misadventure in the Middle East. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=280.74s)]
*  And I'm concerned that's exactly what's going to happen here again. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=283.70000000000005s)]
*  So Congressman, on a related note, the other layer of transparency or oversight, if you [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=287.26000000000005s)]
*  will, of course, the job of the free press. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=292.26000000000005s)]
*  And it was striking yesterday at the Department of Defense that Secretary Hegsteth, who's [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=294.38s)]
*  already really curtailed press access throughout the Pentagon since coming to office back [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=298.52000000000004s)]
*  earlier this year, but spent most of his time assuring a screed against the media's coverage [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=304.14s)]
*  of this. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=310.86s)]
*  And he and the president have mentioned some reporters by name. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=311.86s)]
*  What is your fear there about the intimidation and lack of access? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=315.3s)]
*  Again, I think that attack on Jennifer Griffin of Fox News was meant to basically be a brush [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=319.62s)]
*  back pitch. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=327.22s)]
*  Don't scrutinize us. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=328.66s)]
*  Don't criticize us. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=330.18s)]
*  Don't do the things that the press is required to do in any free society to hold us in check. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=331.34s)]
*  And so I hope that you folks continue to do the good work that you do. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=337.38s)]
*  But I think this was intentional, again, along the lines of what they're saying with leaked [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=343.62s)]
*  information. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=348.78s)]
*  They say that this information that came out in the DIA assessment was somehow leaked, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=349.9s)]
*  and therefore they're not going to share information with Congress. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=355.9s)]
*  Well, look, we have to pursue leaks, of course. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=358.58s)]
*  But my concern here is that they're trying to suppress facts, not just suppress leaks. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=361.85999999999996s)]
*  And that's dangerous. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=367.46s)]
*  Congressman, I want to stick with oversight for a second here because Robert Garcia is [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=368.46s)]
*  now the ranking member on the House Oversight Committee. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=373.17999999999995s)]
*  And this is notable not merely because of his personal accomplishments, but because [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=377.05999999999995s)]
*  of his demographics. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=380.78s)]
*  We're talking about a 47-year-old, the least tenured ranking member. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=381.78s)]
*  What does this indicate to you about something larger, about what is trending and what people [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=386.66s)]
*  have been calling for in terms of turnover on the committee and in Congress? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=392.58s)]
*  I think he's a great choice. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=398.62s)]
*  I think he's going to do a wonderful job as our ranking member. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=399.74s)]
*  Look, I think at this point, given the huge challenges that we have before our country [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=403.38s)]
*  and certainly for our party in the minority, we need to have the best people on the field. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=409.46s)]
*  We need to have the best people in these positions of influence helping to lead the [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=415.5s)]
*  charge. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=420.02s)]
*  And so we elected Robert through the democratic process in our caucus, and I think he's going [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=421.06s)]
*  to do a terrific job. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=427.3s)]
*  All right, Democratic Congressman, Roger Krishnamoorthy of Illinois, thank you, Congressman, for [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=429.18s)]
*  being with us this morning. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=435.06s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=436.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoypcG3730&t=445.5s)]
