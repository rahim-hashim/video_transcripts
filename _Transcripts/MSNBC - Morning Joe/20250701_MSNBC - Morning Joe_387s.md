# Richard Haass: Trump has enormous leverage if he decides to use it on Netanyahu
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [July 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks)
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will visit the White House next Monday, his [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=0.0s)]
*  third trip to Washington during Donald Trump's second term. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=4.84s)]
*  The visit comes just weeks after the U.S. brokered a fragile ceasefire between Israel [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=8.38s)]
*  and Iran following American airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=12.92s)]
*  Since then, attention has returned to Israel's war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, as President [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=17.28s)]
*  Trump renews his push for a ceasefire there and for a hostage release deal. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  Negotiations over Gaza remain stalled with both Israel and Hamas holding firm to their [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=27.36s)]
*  demands. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=32.8s)]
*  Citing local medical officials in Gaza, the New York Times reports an Israeli airstrike [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=33.8s)]
*  hit a beachfront cafe in Gaza City yesterday, killing more than 24 people and injuring dozens [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=38.0s)]
*  of others. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  Joining us now at the table, President Emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations, Richard [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  Haas. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=49.32s)]
*  He's the author of the weekly newsletter, Home and Away, available on Substack. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=50.32s)]
*  Richard, always great to see you, my friend. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=54.28s)]
*  Morning, Willie. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=55.96s)]
*  How about Prime Minister Netanyahu's visit to the White House on Monday? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=57.56s)]
*  You've been writing on Substack lately about this relationship between Donald Trump, where [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=60.84s)]
*  he's shown a willingness to push back against Netanyahu and many of our allies, actually, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=65.24s)]
*  at times when he thinks it's warranted. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  So what's sort of hanging in the air as these two men sit together in the Oval Office? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=73.32s)]
*  There's lots hanging in the air. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  I mean, as you say, the United States, America first doesn't necessarily mean Israel first. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=79.24000000000001s)]
*  The president, if you remember, pushed back against Netanyahu on attacking Iran. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=85.0s)]
*  Israelis wanted to do it, so the U.S. had its own deal with the Houthis. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=89.24000000000001s)]
*  They had their own deal with Hamas. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=92.68s)]
*  You could go on and on. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=94.56s)]
*  On the other hand, the president is intervening in Israeli politics right now, essentially [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  saying that the legal case against Bibi Netanyahu should be dropped. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=100.38s)]
*  This is an interesting relationship. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=104.06s)]
*  President, if you remember, when he ran, said one of his goals to bring about a ceasefire [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=106.94s)]
*  in Gaza, to bring the hostages back home. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=111.8s)]
*  You had a deal, which the new administration then and the old administration jointly brought [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=114.34s)]
*  about. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=120.98s)]
*  Then the Israelis balked at the second phase of it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=121.98s)]
*  The whole idea was to get the hostages back. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=124.5s)]
*  The Israelis would have had to agree to a ceasefire and a pullout from Gaza. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=127.10000000000001s)]
*  So that's still where things stand. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=130.62s)]
*  And things have gotten worse, as you just saw on that story. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=132.66s)]
*  A lot of people are being killed. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=135.42000000000002s)]
*  And the people of Gaza, the 2 million residents, are being packed into ever, ever smaller pieces [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=137.06s)]
*  of territory. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=143.54s)]
*  So life there is unimaginably awful. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=144.78s)]
*  So the question is, can the administration resurrect the basis of a ceasefire? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=147.44s)]
*  As you watch this, this latest beachfront attack, a missile strike in Gaza City, what [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=153.82s)]
*  at this point now is the end game for Bibi Netanyahu? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=159.86s)]
*  In other words, if President Trump is trying to negotiate a ceasefire and things like this [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=163.46s)]
*  are happening, where does Prime Minister Netanyahu want this to end for Israel? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=167.7s)]
*  What does he want? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=172.42000000000002s)]
*  Look, what he wants to do is have this end, but in a manner, Willie, that he can stay [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=173.42000000000002s)]
*  on as prime minister and escape his legal consequences. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=178.54000000000002s)]
*  So it's all caught up in that. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=182.26000000000002s)]
*  The good news is that Bibi Netanyahu has more political standing now because of Iran. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=184.70000000000002s)]
*  So he may have a little bit more strength, a little bit more potential to compromise. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=190.38s)]
*  He would like to get the hostages back. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=196.78s)]
*  That would be a big win. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=199.38s)]
*  All Israelis want to see that. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=200.58s)]
*  The question is, how does he do that in a way that he hasn't eliminated Hamas? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=202.5s)]
*  Hamas still has a role. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=206.74s)]
*  And how do you keep order in Gaza? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=207.74s)]
*  The Israelis still, here it is, what? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=209.22s)]
*  It's over a year and a half since October 7th. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=211.42000000000002s)]
*  There's still not a serious plan, a viable plan for what comes afterwards. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=214.34s)]
*  Right now, the security situation in Gaza is a mixture of Israeli occupation and gangs. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=218.78s)]
*  Let's be honest. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=224.06s)]
*  And the question is, how do you get something where the Israelis don't have to be there, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=225.34s)]
*  Hamas can't revive? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=229.22s)]
*  The only idea people can think of is some type of an Arab force. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=230.78s)]
*  But to have an Arab force, you'd have to have a large Palestinian component in that force. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=234.28s)]
*  What's something the Israelis balk at? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=239.62s)]
*  Because they don't want to do anything in Gaza that would give momentum, that would [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=241.58s)]
*  impart momentum to Palestinian nationalism. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=245.78s)]
*  So that's been the dilemma all along. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=249.18s)]
*  And the real question, quite honestly, is how hard does Donald Trump push Bibi Netanyahu? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=251.34s)]
*  Because right now, if he pushed Bibi Netanyahu, Trump actually is more popular than anybody [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=258.18s)]
*  in Israel. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=262.62s)]
*  And if the Israelis didn't like what Donald Trump were doing, guess what? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=264.1s)]
*  Who do they go to here? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=267.42s)]
*  They're going to go to Chuck Schumer? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=268.42s)]
*  There's no way to do an end run around Donald Trump. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=270.42s)]
*  So Trump has enormous leverage. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=273.34000000000003s)]
*  If, big if, he decides to use it on Bibi Netanyahu. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=275.34000000000003s)]
*  A popularity obviously enhanced by President Trump's decision to attack those nuclear sites [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=278.62s)]
*  inside Iran and now trying to broker some kind of a conversation between Israel and [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=283.14s)]
*  Iran. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=287.94s)]
*  What does that even look like in terms of a ceasefire, which is fragile to say the least? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=288.94s)]
*  Well, it's fragile and it doesn't really address the real issue, which is Iran. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=293.42s)]
*  Right now, the Iranians have two goals. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=297.9s)]
*  One is to make sure their regime survives. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=300.3s)]
*  And there's been really some dark stories coming out of Iran about how they're going [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=302.7s)]
*  around the country looking for anyone who they think may have been cooperating with [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=305.92s)]
*  Israel or whatever. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=309.40000000000003s)]
*  But regime survival is the big thing. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=310.64000000000004s)]
*  The second is whether at some point the Iranians decide what they want to do is reconstitute [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=313.64000000000004s)]
*  their nuclear program in a way that it can't be reached by Israeli or American missiles [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=318.12s)]
*  or bombs or what have you. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=323.52000000000004s)]
*  And I think that's a long term challenge. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=325.8s)]
*  So even though we talked about obliteration, the reality is we didn't. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=328.64s)]
*  So the Iranian nuclear program survived in the three sites we attacked. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=333.0s)]
*  Elements of it survived, which were never there, that had been moved out. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=337.4s)]
*  So I think there's a long term issue between Iran and both Israel and the United States [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=340.96s)]
*  about what's going to happen with this nuclear program. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=347.72s)]
*  Can it be resolved diplomatically? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=349.52s)]
*  That would be a long shot. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=351.08s)]
*  Can it be dealt with militarily? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=352.68s)]
*  That might be something necessary down the road. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=354.16s)]
*  But I think that's where we are. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=356.54s)]
*  This problem hasn't gone away. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=357.64s)]
*  It's just reached a new chapter. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJYOOfqoBks&t=359.36s)]
