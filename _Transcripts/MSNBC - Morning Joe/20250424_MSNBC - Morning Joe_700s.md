# Trump will pay a 'heavy political price' if he abandons Ukraine, WSJ editorial board warns
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs)
*  Let's get to our top story this morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump once again grew angry at Ukraine's president on social media yesterday, accusing [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=2.6s)]
*  Zelensky of, quote, inflammatory statements that will only prolong the war with Russia. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=8.88s)]
*  In a lengthy message, President Trump criticized Zelensky for saying Ukraine would not recognize [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=14.8s)]
*  the Crimean Peninsula as Russian territory. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=21.72s)]
*  Trump went on to call the situation dire for Ukraine, while adding, the United States, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=26.48s)]
*  Ukraine and Russia are very close to a deal, and, quote, the man with no cards to play [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=32.12s)]
*  should now finally get it done. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=38.84s)]
*  It's painful. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=41.88s)]
*  Hours after the president spoke about the negotiations and was asked directly if the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=44.2s)]
*  deal on the table includes officially recognizing the Crimean Peninsula as Russian territory. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=48.84s)]
*  I will say that I think Russia is ready, and a lot of people said Russia wanted to go for [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=56.28s)]
*  the whole thing. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=62.0s)]
*  And they've, I think we have a deal with Russia. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=64.12s)]
*  We have to get a deal with Zelensky, and I hope that Zelensky, I thought it might be [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=68.46000000000001s)]
*  easier to deal with Zelensky. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=72.94s)]
*  So far it's been harder, but that's okay. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=74.7s)]
*  It's all right. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=77.28s)]
*  But I think we have a deal with both. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=78.72s)]
*  And if I may, this deal that you have with Russia, does it include recognizing Russia's [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=81.64s)]
*  sovereignty over Crimea? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=87.92s)]
*  Well, everything is good. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=90.12s)]
*  Look, I just want to see the war end. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=92.6s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=95.12s)]
*  If they're both happy, they both sign an agreement. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=96.12s)]
*  I have no favorites. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  I don't want to have any favorites. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  I want to have a deal done. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=102.44s)]
*  More on those remarks in a moment. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=104.76s)]
*  They followed a series of developments in peace talks that began with the announcement [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=106.16s)]
*  that Secretary of State Marco Rubio would not attend what were supposed to be high-level [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=110.8s)]
*  meetings in London with European negotiating teams. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=115.28s)]
*  Instead, Trump's envoy for Ukraine and Russia, retired Army Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=118.32s)]
*  met with Ukrainian officials. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=123.44s)]
*  Those Ukrainian officials met separately with teams from the UK, Germany, and France. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=125.47999999999999s)]
*  Tomorrow, Presidential Envoy Steve Witkoff is set to meet with Vladimir Putin for the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=130.24s)]
*  fourth time. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=135.52s)]
*  All of this comes as Russia continues to bombard Ukrainian cities. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=136.52s)]
*  Nine people were killed in the capital of Kiev overnight, and more than 70 were injured [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=140.60000000000002s)]
*  by a massive Russian missile and drone strike. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=145.44s)]
*  So, Jonathan Lemire, obviously Russia, Vladimir Putin emboldened by having a new president [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=148.32000000000002s)]
*  who they view as very favorable to his approach here and his war aims. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=153.0s)]
*  But if you go back to what President Trump said, again, explicitly attacking our ally, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=158.68s)]
*  President Zelensky, and again, putting all of the burden, all of the onus on the victim [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=163.96s)]
*  of this invasion three years ago. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=169.72s)]
*  Where does this go from here? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=173.84s)]
*  Are they setting a pretext to walk away completely from all of this? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=175.0s)]
*  Because if you look at what we've had reported out from this apparent peace deal, it gives [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=178.76000000000002s)]
*  everything Russia could have ever wanted when it started this war. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=184.0s)]
*  Let's start right there. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=187.64000000000001s)]
*  The White House Trump administration has asked Russia to give up nothing. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=189.0s)]
*  There's been no compromise, no concession requested from the Trump team. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=192.48s)]
*  He has a number of times even blamed Zelensky for the start of this war, which is preposterous. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=197.79999999999998s)]
*  There's a sovereign nation Russia invaded in February of 2022. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=203.32s)]
*  We know from Marco Rubio last week saying that the United States might be willing to [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=208.67999999999998s)]
*  walk away from peace talks if a deal can't get done soon. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=212.95999999999998s)]
*  We had JD Vance yesterday while overseas spelling out, and we'll get into the details [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=217.14s)]
*  in a moment, but conditions for a ceasefire, for peace, which would involve Ukraine giving [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=221.72s)]
*  up Crimea. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=227.76s)]
*  That's the sticking point right now. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=228.76s)]
*  The Ukrainians are simply not going to recognize Russian territory. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=229.76s)]
*  Now, there's going to be dispute over it. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=233.04s)]
*  There's certainly been since even during the, while President Biden was in office, whether [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=234.68s)]
*  Ukraine really had the ability to retake Crimea, but that is simply not going to be, you don't [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=239.04s)]
*  start the negotiations there. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=243.51999999999998s)]
*  That's where the Trump team seems to want, with such a huge concession from Zelensky also [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=245.72s)]
*  having to say, we'll never join NATO while asking nothing of Russia continuing to fawn [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=251.72s)]
*  in many ways, as what cough has done over Vladimir Putin siding with Moscow day in day [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=256.84s)]
*  out in this conflict. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=261.28s)]
*  And Lemire, as you mentioned, while traveling in India yesterday, Vice President JD Vance [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=262.28s)]
*  repeated the administration's warning about the U.S. walking away from negotiations between [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=268.04s)]
*  Russia and Ukraine if a deal isn't reached soon. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=274.0s)]
*  Well, I'm going to echo something Secretary Rubio said, which is, look, we've issued a [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=279.68s)]
*  very explicit proposal to both the Russians and the Ukrainians, and it's time for them [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=284.40000000000003s)]
*  to either say yes or for the United States to walk away from this process. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=289.12s)]
*  We've engaged in an extraordinary amount of diplomacy, of on-the-ground work. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=293.12s)]
*  We've really tried to understand things from the perspective of both the Ukrainians and [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=297.6s)]
*  the Russians. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=301.40000000000003s)]
*  What do Ukrainians care the most about? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=302.40000000000003s)]
*  What do the Russians care the most about? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=303.96000000000004s)]
*  And I think that we've put together a very fair proposal. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=305.76s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=309.40000000000003s)]
*  And before we get to our experts, what, yeah, tell me what you're thinking right now. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=310.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean, right now, I mean, even as the Vice President said there, she said we're trying [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=315.08000000000004s)]
*  to understand each side's perspective. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=318.2s)]
*  Trying to understand the Russians' perspective. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=320.76s)]
*  We know what their perspective is. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=323.02000000000004s)]
*  They invaded a sovereign nation. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=324.02000000000004s)]
*  They want to seize territory, and Trump wants to give it to them. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=325.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=328.52000000000004s)]
*  That is the bottom line. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=329.52000000000004s)]
*  Doesn't seem much up for interpretation. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=330.52000000000004s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal editorial board has a new piece entitled Trump's Ukraine Ultimatum. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=331.84000000000003s)]
*  It reads in part, quote, Mr. Trump's current offer looks more like an ultimatum than grounds [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=336.8s)]
*  for a durable peace. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=342.48s)]
*  Mr. Trump is angry that Ukraine won't accept a deal that legitimizes Russia's occupation [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=344.40000000000003s)]
*  of Crimea, as if this is a minor map revision. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=351.04s)]
*  The U.S. refusal to credit territories seized by invasion is a principle intended to deter [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=355.72s)]
*  future marauders. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=362.64s)]
*  Letting Russia keep its navy in Crimea is a threat to Europe as much as to Ukraine. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=364.56s)]
*  A peace or even an armistice worth the name requires compromise on both sides. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=370.44s)]
*  But Mr. Trump has applied pressure only on Ukraine. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=377.52s)]
*  Mr. Trump likes to say Ukraine doesn't have the cards, but it does have one ace. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=381.4s)]
*  The president won't be able to abandon Ukraine without paying a heavy political price. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=387.96s)]
*  Mr. Trump can still salvage a deal in Ukraine, but the current final settlement offer looks [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=394.36s)]
*  like it would set up Mr. Putin to win the war now or later. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=401.32s)]
*  The world's rogues will notice, and Mr. Trump's headaches will have only begun, Willie. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=406.72s)]
*  You know, the New York Times reminds us this morning that now Secretary of State Marco [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=414.96000000000004s)]
*  Senator Rubio just three years ago co-sponsored legislation, an amendment, to prohibit the [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=420.68s)]
*  United States from ever recognizing any Russian claim over parts of Ukraine that it has seized, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=425.88s)]
*  which includes Crimea. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=431.92s)]
*  It's saying exactly what the Wall Street Journal just said. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=432.92s)]
*  It says it's a terrible precedent. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=434.88s)]
*  China's watching. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=436.64s)]
*  Taiwan is watching on and on. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=437.64s)]
*  Let's bring in staff writer at the Atlantic Anne Applebaum and former Deputy Assistant [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=439.4s)]
*  Secretary of Defense for Europe and NATO Policy Ian Brzezinski. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=443.32s)]
*  Good morning to you both. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=447.76s)]
*  I'll start with you and just read a quote from President Zelensky in reaction to this [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=448.84s)]
*  apparent proposal, this peace deal, as the United States is calling it. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=453.28s)]
*  Quote, there is nothing to talk about. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=457.52s)]
*  That's from President Zelensky. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=460.0s)]
*  So where do you see us going from here? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=461.88s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=463.71999999999997s)]
*  You know, let me put this in historical context. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=464.71999999999997s)]
*  What we see President Trump doing is basically forcing Europe and Ukraine to make concessions [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=468.84s)]
*  of territory and sovereignty of the likes that we haven't seen since the 1938 Munich [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=476.8s)]
*  agreement when Neville Chamberlain forced Czechoslovakia to give up the Sudetenland [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=483.4s)]
*  to Hitler, an agreement that unleashed the violence of World War II. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=488.91999999999996s)]
*  It's something we haven't seen since the Yalta Accord, an accord that enabled Soviet [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=494.24s)]
*  dictator Joseph Stalin to impose a sphere of influence over Central and Eastern Europe, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=500.52s)]
*  a domination that lasted for five decades. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=506.64s)]
*  And the tragedy of this, it is totally unnecessary because Trump likes to say he has all the [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=510.24s)]
*  cards. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=515.16s)]
*  And in fact, the transatlantic community led by the United States does have all the cards. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=516.16s)]
*  We have some $55 trillion in GDP among NATO nations. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=521.24s)]
*  That's about half of the world's GDP against Russia's $2 trillion. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=525.04s)]
*  The alliance spends about $1.5 trillion on defense annually against Russia's $200 billion. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=529.72s)]
*  That's a factor of 10. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=535.84s)]
*  It's amazing that the West, led by Trump, isn't forcing or enabling Ukraine to end this [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=538.0s)]
*  war on its terms. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=544.22s)]
*  And it's a tragedy. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=547.0s)]
*  You know, Biden failed to leverage that power against Putin. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=548.0s)]
*  But Trump is even weaker than Biden. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=553.1600000000001s)]
*  Not only is he forcing Ukraine into concessions, he's setting up dynamics that history has [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=556.6s)]
*  taught us will set up the pretext for a wider and more dangerous war. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=563.08s)]
*  So Trump is not leveraging American power very effectively. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=568.32s)]
*  He's proving weak. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=571.28s)]
*  And he's undermining not just Ukraine, but our own interests in having enduring peace [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=572.28s)]
*  and stability in Europe. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=576.48s)]
*  So Anne, if we're reaching back to Neville Chamberlain, reaching back to Yalta, not a [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=578.32s)]
*  good sign, obviously. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=582.0400000000001s)]
*  I'm curious what you make of what we've seen just in the last 24 hours, the statements [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=584.44s)]
*  from the president, secretary of state Marco Rubio declining to show up for those negotiations [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=588.6s)]
*  in London, all against the backdrop of the enduring question of more than a decade, which [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=594.16s)]
*  is why? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=600.0s)]
*  Why does President Trump, why does he always as a reflex side with Vladimir Putin and Russia? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=601.52s)]
*  So I will start by saying, agreeing with Ian, to say that Putin has never given up his main [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=609.48s)]
*  goal in Ukraine. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=617.0s)]
*  His goal is to remove Ukrainian sovereignty, to change the nature of the Ukrainian government, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=618.36s)]
*  to make sure that Ukraine does not ever integrate with Europe, to make sure that it stays inside [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=623.7600000000001s)]
*  some kind of Russian sphere of influence, preferably maybe even sharing sovereignty [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=629.12s)]
*  with Russia. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=634.44s)]
*  So he has never, ever said that he has given that up. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=635.44s)]
*  He says he'll change his language a little bit, but he maintains that all the time. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=638.48s)]
*  And so even in all these negotiations, they keep talking about how they've been talking [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=643.4399999999999s)]
*  and talking and they're tired of the negotiations and so on. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=648.6s)]
*  They've never, ever put any pressure on Russia to change it. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=652.6s)]
*  And you're right to ask why is it that Trump continues to support this? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=655.36s)]
*  And the only answer I can see is that Trump admires people who have unlimited power. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=661.76s)]
*  He admires people who don't have checks and balances. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=668.72s)]
*  He admires people who simply exercise violence, who use it without restraint. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=671.84s)]
*  He sees that Putin does that, and he admires it. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW7b1drocOs&t=676.8000000000001s)]
