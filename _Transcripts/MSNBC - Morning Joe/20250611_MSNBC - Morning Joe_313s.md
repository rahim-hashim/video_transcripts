# Why the White House is 'delighted' with events in Los Angeles
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is)
*  So, Jonathan Lemire, you have a new piece reporting in The Atlantic, and it's a piece [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=0.0s)]
*  you co-wrote. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=6.84s)]
*  It's entitled, The White House is Delighted with Events in Los Angeles. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=7.84s)]
*  You write in part this, Indeed, officials at the White House told us they are satisfied [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=12.18s)]
*  with the way the L.A. confrontation has unfolded. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=16.78s)]
*  They believe that it highlights their focus on immigration and law and order, and places [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=20.2s)]
*  Democrats on the wrong side of both. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=26.42s)]
*  One widely circulated photo showing a masked protester standing in front of a burning car [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=29.58s)]
*  waving a Mexican flag has been embraced by Trump supporters as a distillation of the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=34.4s)]
*  conflict. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=41.019999999999996s)]
*  A president unafraid to use force to defend an American city from those he deems foreign [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=42.019999999999996s)]
*  invaders. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=47.58s)]
*  We couldn't have scripted this better, said a senior White House aide granted anonymity [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=48.58s)]
*  to discuss internal conversations. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=53.879999999999995s)]
*  It's like the 2024 elections never ended. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=56.58s)]
*  Trump is strong, while Democrats are weak, and defending the indefensible. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=59.3s)]
*  A lot of concern that Democrats are being played here in a big way, even the media to [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=66.3s)]
*  an extent. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=72.56s)]
*  What more can you tell us about your reporting, Jonathan? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=74.18s)]
*  Samika, certainly the White House, as you just read, very pleased with how this is going [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=76.62s)]
*  so far. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=80.75999999999999s)]
*  They think these are some of the president's strongest issues, and that he looks like a [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=81.75999999999999s)]
*  commander in chief in charge situation. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=85.28s)]
*  Democrats in 2024 certainly recognized throughout much of the Biden years that immigration was [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=88.38s)]
*  a vulnerability for them. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=93.56s)]
*  I will say, though, that Democrats in the last day or two have been happy to stop talking [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=96.22s)]
*  about immigration as much and more about the president's use of the National Guard. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=100.4s)]
*  They feel like that's much safer political terrain for them, that a lot of Americans [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=104.12s)]
*  are upset with the idea of the military, the Marines even, on the streets of an American [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=107.24000000000001s)]
*  city. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=114.08s)]
*  And certainly there are some Republicans, the piece also notes, that we've spoken to [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=115.88s)]
*  who worry the president might be on the verge of overreaching here, playing too much with [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=118.24s)]
*  the military. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=125.72s)]
*  He has certainly, in 2020, was talked out of deploying the National Guard as much as [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=126.72s)]
*  he would have wanted. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=132.12s)]
*  They did some, but not as much as he would have liked. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=133.24s)]
*  He, of course, as we have talked about yesterday, even in 2020, wanted, asked his military leaders [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=135.28s)]
*  if it would be okay to shoot protesters in the legs. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=140.3s)]
*  He was told, absolutely not. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=142.52s)]
*  You can't do that. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=143.76s)]
*  He certainly hasn't invoked the Insurrection Act yet, but we heard from him again yesterday [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=145.8s)]
*  saying he's thinking about it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=149.5s)]
*  He seems more willing to take that extra step, and certainly he's surrounded by much more [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=151.26s)]
*  about yes men this time around. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=157.06s)]
*  So yeah, Mika, a few White House aides I talked to, look, they like this show of force. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=159.38s)]
*  They don't want there to be violence, the aides said. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=164.86s)]
*  They recognize if there is a full-fledged clash between the military and protesters, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=167.56s)]
*  that's not good for anyone, obviously. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=171.94s)]
*  They also would create more scenes of chaos, and they think that would turn off Americans [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=174.08s)]
*  across the country. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=178.42000000000002s)]
*  But right now, they like this idea that the president looks like he's a man of action. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=180.56s)]
*  They of course are very critical of how the California governor and the Los Angeles mayor [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=185.32000000000002s)]
*  have handled this. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=188.52s)]
*  There's pushback, of course, from the other side, but they feel like this plays right [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=190.16000000000003s)]
*  into the strengths, a strong leader, and gets to talk about immigration. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=193.20000000000002s)]
*  And they have to create this scene of chaos with the help of some images from their friends [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=196.28s)]
*  in the media to justify what they're doing. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=199.94s)]
*  So Carlos Cribbello, let's talk about the way that the governor, the mayor of Los Angeles [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=202.98s)]
*  have handled this. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=208.1s)]
*  They have said again and again over the last several days, if you commit violence, you [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=209.1s)]
*  will be arrested, you will be punished, we will track you down and find you. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=213.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=217.22s)]
*  That said, they believe the Los Angeles Police Department is more than equipped to handle [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=218.22s)]
*  demonstrations of this size and to make the arrests they've been making without the help [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=222.78s)]
*  National Guard troops and 700 United States Marines. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=228.48s)]
*  Yeah, Willie, I think this is really Gavin Newsom's moment, right? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=231.64s)]
*  And I think he has handled it with sobriety. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=236.79999999999998s)]
*  I think he's trying to control the narrative. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=238.83999999999997s)]
*  It's very difficult when you're competing with some of the images that keep getting [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=241.62s)]
*  replayed on the news. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=245.88s)]
*  And a lot of this is newsworthy. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=248.2s)]
*  I mean, when people are assaulting federal government agents, that is a big deal and [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=249.67999999999998s)]
*  that should be covered and every network has covered it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=254.8s)]
*  Now, of course, there are some exaggerations in terms of how widespread this is, how violent [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=258.04s)]
*  it is. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=263.96000000000004s)]
*  And that's what Gavin Newsom and Karen Bass are having to contend with. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=264.96000000000004s)]
*  But I really do think what Newsom is trying to do here is to win the middle of the country. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=268.8s)]
*  And I think it makes a lot of sense to deemphasize the immigration issue. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=274.52s)]
*  Immigration is still not a good issue for Democrats. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=279.48s)]
*  The majority of American people don't trust the Democratic Party on the immigration issue. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=282.91999999999996s)]
*  So to shift to the excessive use of force does make a lot of sense to me. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUNlJJU7is&t=287.4s)]
