# As China tensions surge, Taiwan braces for conflict—and watches Washington
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE)
*  It's not just Ukraine and the Middle East that are under tremendous pressure overseas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=0.0s)]
*  It's also the situation in the Far East, as China stares down Taiwan with serious ambitions [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  to claim that island as its own. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  Taiwan's military planners say American support, including weapons deals, are critical in fending [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=17.42s)]
*  off a potential Chinese attack. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=22.6s)]
*  Let's bring in NBC News International correspondent, Janice Mackey-Frayer, live in Beijing. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=25.96s)]
*  Janice, you've got to look at how Taiwan is racing to overhaul its military and get Trump's [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=31.6s)]
*  backing. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=38.28s)]
*  What can you tell us? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=39.68s)]
*  Well, Mika, the U.S. has long been a key backer for Taiwan, with billions of dollars in weapons [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=41.68s)]
*  deals. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=47.68s)]
*  These are purchases, not military aid, as well as U.S. training assistance. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=48.68s)]
*  Less clear is how far U.S. support would go, namely, would the U.S. defend Taiwan? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=53.04s)]
*  This is a looming question in Taipei these days, as officials face not only heightened [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=59.04s)]
*  military activity by China around the island, but mixed messaging from the White House. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=63.64s)]
*  This live-fire drill was years in the making, with high-precision weapons made in the USA [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=71.52s)]
*  and purchased by Taiwan. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=77.36s)]
*  These high-mars, high-mobility artillery rocket systems arrived here late last year, the same [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=80.27999999999999s)]
*  systems Ukrainian soldiers have been using to target Russian positions. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=86.55999999999999s)]
*  Mobile launchers are equipped with guided rockets that can strike 185 miles away. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=92.83999999999999s)]
*  That's well beyond the southeastern coast of China. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=98.75999999999999s)]
*  More of these rocket systems will be delivered here next year. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=101.88s)]
*  It's earlier than planned, part of this race to overhaul Taiwan's defenses. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=104.96s)]
*  This colonel said, we have 100 percent confidence in our readiness, new equipment and strategy. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=112.6s)]
*  Taiwan is a self-governing democracy that Beijing claims as its own. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=118.67999999999999s)]
*  China's President Xi Jinping makes no secret of his intentions to unify the island with [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=123.36s)]
*  the mainland, and won't rule out using force. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=128.24s)]
*  We face a huge challenge, a security challenge from the mainland China. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=131.68s)]
*  So we have to make ourselves very well on the combat readiness. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=135.96s)]
*  Billions of dollars in U.S. arms deals have been helping Taiwan build up and revamp its [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  defenses with weapons like drones, missiles and upgraded fighter jets. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=150.60000000000002s)]
*  They've expanded mandatory military service to one year, and reservist training just increased [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=157.44s)]
*  too. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=162.88s)]
*  I think it's useful in practice, says this reservist. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=165.88s)]
*  U.S. military personnel are also involved with training, at least dozens of them according [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=168.84s)]
*  to the Pentagon, though an exact number on the ground and what they do is a bit murky. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=174.12s)]
*  It's all fundamental to a U.S. mandate to provide Taiwan with weapons and skills to [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=180.96s)]
*  deter any attack by China. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=187.08s)]
*  High Mars mark a significant step, as well as an intelligence sharing deal with the U.S. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=189.08s)]
*  Is it a game changer for Taiwan? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=195.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=197.84s)]
*  Yet now, more than ever here, there are questions about reliability and whether the U.S. would [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=198.84s)]
*  intervene if China ever invaded. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=205.12s)]
*  Taiwan did take all of our chip business. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=208.24s)]
*  We used to make our own chips, now they're made in Taiwan. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=210.56s)]
*  The U.S. missiles in Taipei were rattled first by comments President Trump made on the campaign [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=213.64s)]
*  trail regarding semiconductors, and then telling Bloomberg in an interview after his inauguration [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=218.35999999999999s)]
*  that Taiwan, quote, should pay us for defense. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=224.28s)]
*  You don't have the cards. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=227.62s)]
*  Then came the collapse of U.S. support for Ukraine, and now the threat of steep tariffs [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=229.12s)]
*  on Taiwan's exports. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=234.68s)]
*  We still consider that there is conflicting ideas emerging in the U.S. government right [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=236.68s)]
*  now. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=245.72s)]
*  Which voices or narratives should we listen to? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=246.72s)]
*  Taiwan's president is pledging this week to buy more American goods as it tries to downplay [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=250.64000000000001s)]
*  tariff tensions as friendly friction. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=256.0s)]
*  But leaning into the anxiety is China, ramping up military activity around the island, and [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=259.12s)]
*  most recently, staging amphibious landing drills in the Taiwan Strait. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=265.4s)]
*  The head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, Admiral Samuel Paparo, warned that Chinese exercises [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=270.56s)]
*  are not drills but rehearsals, leaving the island looking to Washington for clues about [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=276.84s)]
*  whether more deals will equal a deterrent for China or just more uncertainty. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=283.08s)]
*  Taiwan's government boosted defense spending to 3 percent of the island's budget to show [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=289.52s)]
*  that it is doing more to defend itself. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=293.9s)]
*  But President Trump and others in the administration have said it should be 10 percent. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=296.29999999999995s)]
*  There is talk of more weapons deals in the works, possibly exceeding what Taiwan bought [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=300.65999999999997s)]
*  during Trump's first term. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=305.5s)]
*  That's according to Reuters. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=306.97999999999996s)]
*  But again, none of it with any guarantees that President Trump will be any more committed [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=308.38s)]
*  than in the past or in the long run. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=312.7s)]
*  Jonathan? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=315.29999999999995s)]
*  NBC's Janice Mackey-Ferrer, live for us in Beijing. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=316.29999999999995s)]
*  Thank you so very much. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=319.62s)]
*  Joining us now here in New York, executive director at the McCain Institute, Dr. Evelyn [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=321.94s)]
*  Farkas. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=325.14s)]
*  She is the former deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=326.14s)]
*  Good to see you, Dr. Farkas. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=331.62s)]
*  I want to turn to Ukraine, but first a brief bit on this. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=332.62s)]
*  What is your assessment right now? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=336.78s)]
*  How aggressive do you think Xi Jinping is going to be? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=338.3s)]
*  How is he viewing the landscape, but also his political situation at home, factoring [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=341.38s)]
*  into whether he makes a move on Taiwan? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=346.78s)]
*  Xi is not a risk taker like Vladimir Putin, but he's clearly watching our diplomacy. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=349.46s)]
*  I know we're going to talk about Russia, Ukraine, because he's looking to see, is the United [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=354.18s)]
*  States willing to stand up and stand by Ukraine? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=357.82s)]
*  If we waiver, he will be more emboldened to take action against Taiwan. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=360.82s)]
*  And he's clearly probing to see what kind of advantage he can take. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=364.62s)]
*  He's moving more incrementally. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=368.94s)]
*  So he's moving in closer and closer to Taiwan, trying to take away their freedom of action, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=370.94s)]
*  their freedom of maneuver. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=376.14s)]
*  And this is what Admiral Paparo is warning about. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=377.46s)]
*  These are not dress rehearsals. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=379.3s)]
*  So I think we have to really make sure that we're telegraphing clearly deterrent messages, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=381.14s)]
*  frankly, from the White House. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=386.38s)]
*  I mean, that's what the reporting is saying. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=387.38s)]
*  So let's turn now to Ukraine. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=388.98s)]
*  I have a long piece co-authored with Ashley Parker in The Atlantic Today about the state [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=390.98s)]
*  of how the White House is viewing this conflict. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=395.2s)]
*  And President Trump a week or so back sort of really signaled he's going to step back [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=397.66s)]
*  from diplomatic efforts, which has set off a lot of alarm bells. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=400.66s)]
*  But here as we report, privately unhappy with Vladimir Putin. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=404.7s)]
*  He does feel a bit humiliated here that Russia continues to ignore U.S. calls for a ceasefire. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=407.86s)]
*  Ukraine and Russia are meeting next week again in Istanbul, U.S. not involved. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=413.1s)]
*  We're told that President Trump wants to see some progress there, or he might, again, I [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=417.14s)]
*  emphasize, might actually take action against Russia with some sanctions. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=422.02000000000004s)]
*  We know there's a big bill in the Senate. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=426.14s)]
*  But if passed his prologue, he's never stood up to Putin before. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=428.18s)]
*  Do you think he would now? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=431.18s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=432.18s)]
*  I mean, if he really wants progress, the only way he's going to get it, Jonathan, is to [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=433.18s)]
*  put pressure on Putin. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=436.7s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=438.38s)]
*  It means he doesn't show up until the Russians give him whatever their memorandum is that [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=439.38s)]
*  they owe him. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=443.82s)]
*  And frankly, I don't think the Ukrainians should either. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=444.9s)]
*  Second, he's got a huge advantage that was handed to him by Senator Lindsey Graham and [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=447.34s)]
*  82 senators who are waiting with this like sword, you know, this threat that the president [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=451.65999999999997s)]
*  can lodge at Russia to say, if you guys don't make a peace deal, we have hard sanctions [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=457.2s)]
*  coming. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=462.94s)]
*  has proposed and they like I said, they have 82 co co signatories, they're ready to go [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=464.94s)]
*  with it. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=469.98s)]
*  It's secondary sanctions. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=470.98s)]
*  This would really hurt Russia. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=471.98s)]
*  And we can't underscore the fact that Russia is weak economically and militarily. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=473.24s)]
*  It might look like they're not because they bluster, but sanctions would hurt them. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=478.08s)]
*  The other thing, of course, is assistance to Ukraine. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=482.42s)]
*  President Trump can offer to do more there. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=485.06s)]
*  Well, that was takes me to my final question here is that there's a sense of people I've [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=486.9s)]
*  talked to that if the US steps away from diplomatic efforts, certainly that's an advantage [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=491.06s)]
*  to Russia and they've already there seems like they're launching their summer offensive [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=494.9s)]
*  now. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=497.58s)]
*  But as long as the intel sharing continues and the assistance goes, there's a sense [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=498.58s)]
*  that Ukraine with Europe's help can weather the storm. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=502.14s)]
*  But how concerned would you be if Trump pulls that back to I would be really concerned. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=504.86s)]
*  I do think the Europeans are making a difference and seeing the German Chancellor Merz out [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=509.34000000000003s)]
*  there talking very robustly and making a real commitment to technology transfer and working [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=514.18s)]
*  with Ukraine on creating more munitions, long range munitions. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=520.5400000000001s)]
*  That's serious, but that will take time, Jonathan. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=524.38s)]
*  And we need to help them with air defense. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=527.0600000000001s)]
*  I mean, remember what Putin's doing is attacking civilians. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=528.7s)]
*  And those are our patriot missiles that protect the Ukrainians. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=531.88s)]
*  And Evelyn, what do you say to people who are skeptical when you try to connect our [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=535.58s)]
*  response in Ukraine to what might happen in Taiwan? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=540.1800000000001s)]
*  Well, I just say look at what the Ukrainian or sorry, look at what the Russians and the [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=544.74s)]
*  Chinese say about their relationship. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=549.66s)]
*  They're working closely together. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=551.9399999999999s)]
*  They believe they are strategic allies. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=553.3s)]
*  China loves the fact that Russia is waging this war in Ukraine and distracting the United [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=555.54s)]
*  States and our allies to include our Asian allies and making them nervous. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=560.18s)]
*  So clearly that the Chinese and the Russians, along with the Iranians and North Koreans [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=564.2199999999999s)]
*  are working in concert. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDNgyPw84vE&t=569.54s)]
