# Trump meets with lawmakers to push huge spending bill
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano)
*  You know, we had a majority of one. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=0.0s)]
*  We were one heart attack away from losing the House. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=2.0s)]
*  Okay? Now we have seven. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=5.0s)]
*  That's a big one because we won some elections, as you probably noticed. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=7.0s)]
*  And we're going to win a lot of elections. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=10.0s)]
*  We have an economy that's roaring. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=12.0s)]
*  We took out $5.1 billion. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=14.0s)]
*  If you take a look, $5.1 trillion with a T, not a B. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=17.0s)]
*  $5.1 trillion out of the Middle East. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=21.0s)]
*  They're investing more than that. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=23.0s)]
*  It's going to be ultimately more than that. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=25.0s)]
*  We've got 180 wide-body Boeing aircraft. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=27.0s)]
*  They're spending money at levels that nobody's ever seen. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=31.0s)]
*  Usually a president goes for a trip and they lose his money. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=34.0s)]
*  In other words, he gives money. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=37.0s)]
*  We went for a trip, but we took out $5.1 trillion. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=39.0s)]
*  Nobody has ever seen anything like it. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=43.0s)]
*  And that's just the beginning. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=45.0s)]
*  So I think we're going to — I think we're a very unified party. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=47.0s)]
*  The Senate is doing great. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=50.0s)]
*  John Thune is doing fantastic. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=51.0s)]
*  He's a great guy. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=53.0s)]
*  And we're going to have a bill, the one big, beautiful bill. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=54.0s)]
*  I think it's going to be — it's the biggest bill ever passed. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=57.0s)]
*  And we've got to get it done. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=60.0s)]
*  Tremendous tax cuts for people, tremendous incentives, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=61.0s)]
*  tremendous regulation cuts, all these regulations that are so horrible. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=64.0s)]
*  And now you plan that and find out what happens, because Biden — [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=69.0s)]
*  look, it's a very sad thing what happened, but I really — [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=73.0s)]
*  we're going to start looking into this whole thing with who signed this legislation. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=76.0s)]
*  Who signed legislation opening our border? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=80.0s)]
*  I don't think he knew. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=82.0s)]
*  I said there's nobody that could want an open border. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=83.0s)]
*  Nobody. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=86.0s)]
*  And now I find out that it wasn't him. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=87.0s)]
*  He auto-penned it. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=89.0s)]
*  Who was operating the auto-penn? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=91.0s)]
*  This is a very serious thing. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=93.0s)]
*  We had a president that didn't sign anything. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=94.0s)]
*  He auto-penned almost everything. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=96.0s)]
*  He opened the borders of the United States of America. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=98.0s)]
*  And I kept saying, who would do such a thing allowing criminals to border in from all over the world — [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=102.0s)]
*  not just South America, all over the world. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=108.0s)]
*  They came in from Africa. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=110.0s)]
*  They came in from Asia. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=111.0s)]
*  They came from the Congo. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=112.0s)]
*  The prisons in the Congo, in Africa — these are rough people. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=113.0s)]
*  The prisons from the Congo are empty. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=118.0s)]
*  You know where they are? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=121.0s)]
*  They're in this country. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=122.0s)]
*  Who would sign this? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=123.0s)]
*  Nobody would sign it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=125.0s)]
*  No sane person would sign it. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=126.0s)]
*  You know who signed it? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=128.0s)]
*  Radical Aflutinitiks that were running our country. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=129.0s)]
*  And the auto-penn signed it. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=132.0s)]
*  And they didn't want him, and they were disappointed in getting him because they wanted Bernie Sanders. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=133.0s)]
*  And then after about two weeks, they said, wait a minute, this is a gift. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=139.0s)]
*  He'll do anything. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=143.0s)]
*  We're going to use the auto-penn. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=145.0s)]
*  And they used the auto-penn on everything. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=147.0s)]
*  He didn't approve this stuff because when Joe Biden was with it, he would never have approved it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=149.0s)]
*  You take a look. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=154.0s)]
*  He would have never approved open borders. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=155.0s)]
*  Go ahead, another question. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=157.0s)]
*  Are Republicans still grandstanding in your view? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=158.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, sure. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=160.0s)]
*  You have a couple that will grandstand. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=161.0s)]
*  But I think even the grandstanders should. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=163.0s)]
*  The alternative is a 68 percent tax increase. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=165.0s)]
*  And you can blame the Democrats for that and one or two grandstanders. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=168.0s)]
*  We only have one or two. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=172.0s)]
*  But we have tremendous support. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=174.0s)]
*  But you'll have a 68 percent tax increase or you'll get a massive tax decrease. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=176.0s)]
*  You'll get a tax cut the likes of which we've never had before. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=184.0s)]
*  This is bigger than any Ronald Reagan tax cut. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=187.0s)]
*  It's even bigger than the tax cut that I gave because, as you know, that's being extended and increased. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=190.0s)]
*  So this is the biggest tax cut in the history of our country. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=196.0s)]
*  Or you'll get a 68 percent tax increase. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=199.0s)]
*  And if that happens, I mean, what Republican could vote for that to happen? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=203.0s)]
*  Because there wouldn't be a Republican much longer. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=207.0s)]
*  They would get they would be knocked out so fast. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=209.0s)]
*  But we're going up to details. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=212.0s)]
*  This is a I'm a cheerleader for this party and I'm a cheerleader for the country. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=214.0s)]
*  Much more importantly for the country. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=219.0s)]
*  But I'm a cheerleader for the party. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=221.0s)]
*  And we're going to go up and I think we're going to have a very good discussion. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=223.0s)]
*  There are one or two points that some people feel strongly about, but maybe not so strongly. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=227.0s)]
*  On one of those points, do you consider some of the proposals on the table in co-paying provider tax as a benefit cut? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=231.0s)]
*  How are you viewing them? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=238.0s)]
*  We're going to look we are looking at one thing. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=239.0s)]
*  We're not doing any cutting of anything meaningful. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=241.0s)]
*  The only thing we're cutting is waste, fraud and abuse with Medicaid waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=245.0s)]
*  There's tremendous waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=251.0s)]
*  There's incompetent things. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=254.0s)]
*  We have illegal aliens that are multiple killers with multiple murder records getting Medicaid. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=256.0s)]
*  I don't think anybody minds that we got that. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=262.0s)]
*  The Democrats, on the other hand, are going to destroy it because they're going to leave these people on. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=265.0s)]
*  We're cutting three things waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=269.0s)]
*  We're not changing Medicaid and we're not changing Medicare and we're not changing Social Security. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=273.0s)]
*  And if I wanted to do those things, I would have done it during my four years that we were. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=279.0s)]
*  Mr. President, what's your message to your fellow New Yorker Republicans who are hung up on the SALT issue? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=283.0s)]
*  Well, SALT is a very interesting thing because the governors of New York and Illinois, you know, the big Jamie is going nowhere. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=290.0s)]
*  Probably right now he couldn't be the worst governor in the country. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=300.0s)]
*  But Illinois and Gavin Newsom, those are the people that want this. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=303.0s)]
*  And they're Democrat states. They're all Democrat states. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=310.0s)]
*  You know, Ronald Reagan tried very hard to get this passed. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=313.0s)]
*  Was unable to do it the way we have it, where basically everybody's treated equally. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=318.0s)]
*  He tried it so hard and he never got it done. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=323.0s)]
*  He was always disappointed. He never got it done. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=325.0s)]
*  We got it done. Now people want to change it. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=327.0s)]
*  So we're going to be talking about that. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=330.0s)]
*  But the biggest beneficiary, if we do that, are governors from New York, Illinois and California. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=332.0s)]
*  And those governors are the ones that blew it because they weren't able to get it. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=339.0s)]
*  So I think we're going to be explaining that these are all very blue states that I don't really believe. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=343.0s)]
*  We had honest elections. I don't actually believe. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=350.0s)]
*  I think I would have won California. I would have won New York. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=352.0s)]
*  I even think I would have won Illinois. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=355.0s)]
*  I think if they, we have to, you know, we're going to start this after I was talking to Mike. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=357.0s)]
*  And again, I'm his biggest fan. I love this guy. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=361.0s)]
*  He's the only guy who could have walked in with a one. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=364.0s)]
*  Think of it. You can't be a guy like me and have a one majority. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=367.0s)]
*  You have to be a guy like him, a nice person. He's very religious. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=372.0s)]
*  He prays. He's a man of God. And so am I. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=376.0s)]
*  But he's really to a new level, I will tell you. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=379.0s)]
*  He is a great guy. They love him in Louisiana and they love him in, that's the only kind of guy. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=382.0s)]
*  Somebody said, oh, well, we want somebody that if you put a certain personality in there, you would have never. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=387.0s)]
*  Look at the look at what he got past, what he's gotten past. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=393.0s)]
*  And just so you understand, he's gotten this best, too. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=396.0s)]
*  And I don't think there's anybody I could give you guys that is so tough. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=400.0s)]
*  You guys would run if you ever looked at him. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=403.0s)]
*  If you ever saw some of these guys, you would not ask him questions you'd be afraid to. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=405.0s)]
*  This guy did something that I don't think there's anybody that's more well suited to be speaker of the House, especially in a case like this. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HJgC-nGano&t=409.0s)]
