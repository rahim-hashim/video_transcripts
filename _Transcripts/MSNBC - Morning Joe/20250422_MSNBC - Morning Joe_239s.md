# Pope Francis lies in state in Vatican City
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [April 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg-SbojvltI)
*  We begin the fourth hour of Morning Joe with a live look at the Vatican. Welcome to the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg-SbojvltI&t=0.0s)]
*  fourth hour. It's 6 a.m. on the West Coast, 9 a.m. in the East. Cardinals are gathering [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg-SbojvltI&t=6.76s)]
*  there to plan the details for the funeral for Pope Francis, which is scheduled for Saturday [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg-SbojvltI&t=12.52s)]
*  morning. This comes as the world awaits to find out who the next leader of the Catholic [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg-SbojvltI&t=18.6s)]
*  Church will be. Joining us live at the Vatican, MSNBC senior national correspondent Chris [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg-SbojvltI&t=25.0s)]
*  Jansing with more. Chris? Good morning, Mika. Well, the ancient ritual that is the funeral [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg-SbojvltI&t=30.8s)]
*  of a pope followed by the conclave is well underway. As you said, Cardinals have begun [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg-SbojvltI&t=39.44s)]
*  descending on Rome. We have seen pictures of them at the airport and arriving here at [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg-SbojvltI&t=44.92s)]
*  St. Peter's Square and most particularly this morning. They had the first in a series [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg-SbojvltI&t=49.44s)]
*  of meetings that's called the General Congregation when they are making the decisions about the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg-SbojvltI&t=54.559999999999995s)]
*  schedule for the coming days and weeks. Right now, the body of Pope Francis is lying at [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg-SbojvltI&t=58.959999999999994s)]
*  Casa Sancta Marta. That is the very simple place where he chose to live instead of the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg-SbojvltI&t=64.96s)]
*  more opulent papal apartments. It's right behind Brunelleschi's dome, which is that famous [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg-SbojvltI&t=70.84s)]
*  dome that is the top St. Peter's behind me. And they gathered today family members, close [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg-SbojvltI&t=76.2s)]
*  friends and they began to say their goodbyes to Pope Francis, the Vatican releasing the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg-SbojvltI&t=83.04s)]
*  first images of the pope in the simple coffin that he chose to be in, different again as [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg-SbojvltI&t=88.28s)]
*  he also often was from previous popes. And then they gave out the schedule. So beginning [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg-SbojvltI&t=95.04s)]
*  tomorrow, Pope Francis's body will lie in state there in the Basilica behind me. There [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg-SbojvltI&t=101.96s)]
*  was an American family that I spoke to very briefly who were hoping to see that today. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg-SbojvltI&t=107.39999999999999s)]
*  And there are large signs that say that St. Peter's Basilica will be open beginning at [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg-SbojvltI&t=113.24s)]
*  11 o'clock tomorrow morning. So they're making a decision about whether to stay and have [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg-SbojvltI&t=118.08s)]
*  an opportunity to take part in that and to pay their respects. That will go on for three [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg-SbojvltI&t=122.6s)]
*  days. And during that time, there will be other meetings of the general congregation. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg-SbojvltI&t=128.4s)]
*  But what they did release today was that there will be a movement tomorrow again of the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg-SbojvltI&t=132.88s)]
*  coffin carrying the body of Pope Francis over to the Basilica the three days of mourning. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg-SbojvltI&t=139.44s)]
*  And I can tell you I was here for Pope John Paul the last time a pope died while he was [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg-SbojvltI&t=145.48s)]
*  in office. And the lines went on for at least a mile. There were people who waited 24 hours. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg-SbojvltI&t=152.64s)]
*  Two to four million people showed up for the funeral of Pope John Paul II. So they are [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg-SbojvltI&t=158.64s)]
*  bracing here with the same security team that planned the funeral and the security surrounding [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg-SbojvltI&t=163.95999999999998s)]
*  Pope John Paul. They are the same team that are preparing for Pope Francis. Then at 10 [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg-SbojvltI&t=169.2s)]
*  o'clock on Saturday morning, the funeral will begin. Those kinds of decisions about [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg-SbojvltI&t=175.39999999999998s)]
*  who does it are all decided. All of the details of what's going to go on, who will give the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg-SbojvltI&t=183.04s)]
*  homily, who will be serving there, all of them, all the priests, all the cardinals will [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg-SbojvltI&t=190.04s)]
*  be con-celebrating the memorial for St. Francis. And of course, then the question becomes when [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg-SbojvltI&t=196.35999999999999s)]
*  is the conclave? We don't have that answer yet, but I can tell you this, Mika, the speculation [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg-SbojvltI&t=203.76s)]
*  is rampant. Rampant. All right, MSNBC Senior National Correspondent Chris Jansing live [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg-SbojvltI&t=209.64000000000001s)]
*  at the Vatican. Thank you. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg-SbojvltI&t=216.92000000000002s)]
