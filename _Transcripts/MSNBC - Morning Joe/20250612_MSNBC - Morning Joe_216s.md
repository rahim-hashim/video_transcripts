# David Hogg to exit DNC after backlash to his primary plan
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c)
*  David Hogg says he is stepping aside from his role at the Democratic National Committee [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=0.0s)]
*  after the party voted on a plan that would force him to run for his job all over again. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  Hogg, who had just recently been elected as vice chair, angered many in the party with [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=10.5s)]
*  his plan to spend millions of dollars on primary challenges against fellow Democrats in an [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=14.92s)]
*  effort to bring younger voices into the fold. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=20.44s)]
*  The move follows the release of an internal audio recording where party chairman Ken Martin [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=24.060000000000002s)]
*  is heard complaining about Hogg's role. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=29.5s)]
*  I'll be very honest with you. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=33.5s)]
*  For the first time in my hundred days on this job, and Jessica knows this, the other night [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=34.74s)]
*  I said to myself for the first time, I don't know if I want to do this anymore. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=47.06s)]
*  I don't think you intended this, but you essentially destroyed any chance I have to show the leadership [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=50.54s)]
*  that I need to. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=56.14s)]
*  So it's really frustrating. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=58.74s)]
*  And Sam, I think that frustrating is a nice way of putting the way that members of the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=61.58s)]
*  DNC are feeling right now, because this vote that they took to basically hold another vote [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=65.82000000000001s)]
*  on some of their key vice chair slots was actually because of some kind of a bylaw or [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=71.22s)]
*  regulation that members felt that they misinterpreted. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=75.7s)]
*  But what my sources say is that it very clearly became if they voted to revote, which they [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=78.88s)]
*  did, it was a referendum on Hogg. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=83.86s)]
*  And I think him saying I'm not going to run again is reading the writing on the wall. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=86.02s)]
*  But Eugene Daniels and I were talking about this at the end of my show. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=89.62s)]
*  Is it better to have him in the official tent or outside of it, still doing the agitating [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=92.44s)]
*  at the grassroots level that he was always going to be doing? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=97.74s)]
*  To be clear, what Ken Martin said there, I said every day to Jonathan Lemire when I was [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=100.46s)]
*  his editor at the political, I don't know if I have the will to go on. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=104.53999999999999s)]
*  And yet here you stand. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=108.74s)]
*  And yet here I am. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=109.74s)]
*  So you can survive this, Ken Martin. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=110.74s)]
*  Secondarily, let's just be clear. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=113.86s)]
*  David Hogg obviously brings an incredible amount of vigor and energy and youth, which [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=117.98s)]
*  is primarily what they need in the Democratic Party. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=121.5s)]
*  But it's fundamentally crazy to be a DNC official and launch $20 million worth of primary campaigning [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=124.3s)]
*  against Democrats. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=131.26s)]
*  I mean, it's just antithetical to the committee. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=132.26s)]
*  And so it couldn't exist in that fashion. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=136.06s)]
*  Now is it worse to have him out than in? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=139.42000000000002s)]
*  We'll find out. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=142.7s)]
*  I hope I don't get in trouble. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=144.54s)]
*  Piss on the tent? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=145.54s)]
*  Is that what you're saying? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=146.54s)]
*  Yeah, something like that. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=147.54s)]
*  I was saying it without saying it. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=148.54s)]
*  OK, sorry. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=149.54s)]
*  I'm sorry if I got in trouble there. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=150.54s)]
*  I no longer have the will. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=151.54s)]
*  But I do think you can't live with that in the DNC. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=153.73999999999998s)]
*  It's just fundamentally not applicable. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=158.26s)]
*  So they had to get to this place at some point in time. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=160.73999999999998s)]
*  They chose to rip off the bandaid. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=164.17999999999998s)]
*  It was inartful. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=165.54s)]
*  But there was no other outcome. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=167.33999999999997s)]
*  That was also my understanding of the way that the DNC apparatus had been trying to [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=168.85999999999999s)]
*  deal with this, Jonathan, is the fact that they were trying to keep David Hogg within [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=172.98s)]
*  the fold, understanding the generational momentum that he was carrying, but then also trying [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=177.06s)]
*  to tell him, hey, wait, we don't play in primaries like that. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=181.7s)]
*  We have to have neutrality. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=184.26s)]
*  And ultimately, that tension spilled over quite publicly. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=185.94s)]
*  Yeah, no question there. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=188.78s)]
*  Also some smart analysis there from Sam Stein in his final appearance on the NNCBC. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkk3yXWGU0c&t=190.01999999999998s)]
