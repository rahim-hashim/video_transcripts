# 71 percent of Latino voters say country headed in wrong direction, poll shows
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [April 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM)
*  We're talking, Maria Teresa, about the broader themes that keep popping up in these polls, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=0.0s)]
*  but I think when you drill deeper, you're watching how these policy items are being [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=6.48s)]
*  metabolized by specific groups of voters. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=10.06s)]
*  For me, one of the things that struck me in our NBC News poll was the way that Gen Z women [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=13.16s)]
*  are among the most pessimistic about the track of the country right now, but we're also starting [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=17.04s)]
*  to see some cracks in the budding coalition that had been building among Hispanic voters. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=21.52s)]
*  And, of course, you were tracking that in some new polling data as well. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=26.52s)]
*  Well, this is, you know, we basically did a poll of a thousand voters in the last first [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=29.479999999999997s)]
*  two weeks of April trying to see what is the pulse of the Latino community right now. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=34.12s)]
*  Those who voted, those who basically said, you know what, I'm voting because of inflation. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=38.16s)]
*  And it turns out right now that not only is he completely underwater, 71% say that the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=43.12s)]
*  country is going in the wrong direction. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=48.92s)]
*  71%. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=50.68s)]
*  And when you drill down with the Latino community, it's because they care about inflation, they [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=51.68s)]
*  care about housing. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=56.12s)]
*  And they're saying the one thing that we asked him that he promised us that he wasn't going [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=57.96s)]
*  to do was to be willy-nilly when it came to immigration. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=62.0s)]
*  66% of Latino voters feel personally under threat every single day. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=65.52s)]
*  Well, your polling said one in 10 know someone who's been deported. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=70.24s)]
*  One in 10 know who someone was deported. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=73.84s)]
*  But this is where I think that the Republicans are so off track because they're not getting [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=75.36s)]
*  a spine. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  You mentioned Virginia earlier. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=81.12s)]
*  The biggest indicator of what we're going to see in 2026 is Virginia itself because [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=83.0s)]
*  the reason Virginia flipped was because of the Latino and the Asian voter who right now [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=88.14s)]
*  feels unsafe. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  But on top of that, the federal workforce that resides in Virginia, they're not happy [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  with Trump right now. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=99.84s)]
*  And it's an unforced error on his part. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=101.16s)]
*  I do think that when we said, well, why did Latinos vote for Donald Trump? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=103.6s)]
*  He walked in with only one mandate, and that was to lower the price of eggs. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  He has yet to address it at all. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=112.88s)]
*  And instead, he's obfuscating what he promised to do with all these other policy issues that [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=114.8s)]
*  are going to have long-term repercussions on our government. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=119.52s)]
*  So Dave, before we go to break, let's talk the races this year. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=123.47999999999999s)]
*  For people that are campaigning right now, and these polls actually matter, I guess the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=130.48s)]
*  two big races are going to be Virginia, Virginia governorship, and also New Jersey. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=134.32s)]
*  How do both of those races look right now, especially as you do this overlay of where [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=144.44s)]
*  the president is in the polls after 100 days? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=149.76s)]
*  Well, let's look at the numbers, Joe. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=153.56s)]
*  Both are states that Kamal Harris carried by five or six points. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=155.92s)]
*  And look at the special elections we recently had in Florida where Democrats outperformed [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  by between 16 and 22 points. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=164.51999999999998s)]
*  And that just gives you an indication. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=167.67999999999998s)]
*  Look, I don't think we can overlay that onto every race in 25 and 26. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=169.39999999999998s)]
*  But when Glenn Youngkin won Virginia in 2021, there was a pretty unique set of circumstances. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=174.51999999999998s)]
*  There was a backlash to the withdrawal from Afghanistan. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=179.6s)]
*  Concerns were really building about inflation. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=182.11999999999998s)]
*  And he had a good message on the grocery tax. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=185.32s)]
*  And Democrats, frankly, had a fairly weak candidate in Terry McAuliffe. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=187.76s)]
*  This time around, Democrats have very strong candidates in Abigail Spanberger, who made [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=191.23999999999998s)]
*  inroads into rural Virginia when she was running for Congress. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=195.72s)]
*  Mikey Sherrill is pretty well positioned in New Jersey in that primary. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=199.04s)]
*  Josh Gottheimer is in the mix as well. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=202.76s)]
*  But you have this budding narrative of these Democratic women with national security backgrounds [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=204.88s)]
*  who are likely to do well in this year's elections and the midterms. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=210.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=215.79999999999998s)]
*  And I mean, when you look at trend lines, I mean, you can go back years. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=216.79999999999998s)]
*  You look at what happens the year before, even in congressional races, and you look [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=221.16s)]
*  at trend lines. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=226.62s)]
*  And we saw it in 2017 from the very beginning, even in local races. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=227.62s)]
*  We're seeing it here in Iowa, a local race that Democrats never win. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=231.92s)]
*  Will they won this year? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=236.16s)]
*  You look at what happened in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=237.76s)]
*  A state senator gets elected a Democrat first time in, I guess, over 100 years. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=240.92s)]
*  You look at what happens in Wisconsin Supreme Court. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=246.64s)]
*  You can go down the line. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=248.98s)]
*  Certainly, the trend lines are there that give Democrats a reason to be hopeful. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=250.44s)]
*  But still, as these polls show, a lot of questions remain. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=257.04s)]
*  Elections Analyst of the Nonpartisan Cook Political Report with Amy Walter, Dave Wasserman, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=261.44s)]
*  as always, thank you so much for being with us. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=266.64s)]
*  We really appreciate it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=268.72s)]
*  Thanks, Joe. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=269.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9_KbmkLEM&t=280.4s)]
