# Americans deserve apology from Musk for damage DOGE has created: Sen. Schumer
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8)
*  In Colorado eight people were injured after a man used what officials are describing as a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=0.0s)]
*  Makeshift flame thrower as he attacked a group of people [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Marching for awareness of Israeli hostages being held by Hamas [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=10.48s)]
*  authorities are [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=16.2s)]
*  Investigating the assault as an act of terrorism joining us now Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, Mr [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=17.64s)]
*  Leader, thank you for joining us a lot to get to me. Let's start right there [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=25.5s)]
*  With the moment with this attack [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=29.16s)]
*  heinous hateful attack in Boulder that of course comes just two weeks after the shooting in Washington DC [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=31.24s)]
*  That killed two staffers at the Israeli Embassy [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=37.84s)]
*  You I know this is deeply personal for you. Just your thoughts here about this rising tide of anti-semitic violence [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=41.68s)]
*  Well, you know the Jewish people across America and all Americans should be horrified and we are in great pain [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=48.68s)]
*  This is only two weeks after the horrible shooting in DC and a few months after the Jewish governor's [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=57.0s)]
*  Home was firebombed right on a Jewish holiday. This occurred on the Jewish holiday of Shavuos, which celebrates [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=63.28s)]
*  God-giving the Torah to the Jewish people. It's just awful awful and it just it's [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=70.52s)]
*  There's just so much both pain and anger in our community about what is happening [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=77.36s)]
*  This was an elderly group of people [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=83.0s)]
*  Who are simply marching to free the hostages as I understand it. They didn't take positions on [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=85.39999999999999s)]
*  The details of the Middle East just free the hostages and this was done in a vicious nasty way [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=91.83999999999999s)]
*  Unfortunately as we have seen it's not an isolated incident and when anti-semitism which is on the rise in America [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=97.91999999999999s)]
*  dramatically dramatically [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  70% of the religious [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=108.91999999999999s)]
*  Hate crimes have been committed against Jews in America in the last year. We're only 2% of the population [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=111.32000000000001s)]
*  When anti-semitism rears its ugly head [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  It just can lead to terrorism and violence as we have seen if it is not fully rebutted by every quarter in society [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  And certainly we'll be watching for developments here as we learn them today as the investigation continues in in Boulder leader Schumer [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=129.48s)]
*  Let's turn now to the Republican [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=136.72s)]
*  Legislation that passed the house now heads to the Senate as you're well aware there have been some GOP voices [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=140.08s)]
*  Objecting to elements of it give us your sense and in particular these cuts potentially to Medicaid [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=147.60000000000002s)]
*  Which we as you just heard we played senator Ernst shall we say unorthodox defense of over the yeah [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=153.54000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that was kind unorthodox, but in any case [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=160.92000000000002s)]
*  The bottom line is simple. This bill is not big and beautiful [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=164.84s)]
*  It is big and ugly and the bill that came out of the house was even worse than [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=168.06s)]
*  What we had anticipated take health care which you mentioned it will not only greatly slash Medicaid [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=173.62s)]
*  Causing hospitals to close and thousands probably millions of people to be laid off [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=180.86s)]
*  But it will also now raise health care costs for many others tens of millions of Americans will have their health insurance [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=186.7s)]
*  Rise dramatically because of the cuts that were made and it's infuriating and it's it's doubly infuriating the cuts are bad enough [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=194.04s)]
*  But to do them and to give the money that they so-called save [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=201.95999999999998s)]
*  in front of two billionaires billionaires and real wealthy people where a [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=207.32s)]
*  Disproportionate amount of these tax breaks go is outrageous and so we Democrats are fighting this on every front [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=213.28s)]
*  We're not backing down [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=220.16s)]
*  We're doubling down and the more the American people learn about this and the particularly the new changes the more outrage [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=221.44s)]
*  They will be Abe Lincoln said it right public sentiment is everything and I guarantee you Republican senators will be hearing the outrage [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=227.9s)]
*  from their constituencies [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=235.92000000000002s)]
*  So senator we have so much to get to let's just quickly bounce around again [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=238.0s)]
*  Yesterday Ukraine launched a truly stunning attack deep inside [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=242.84s)]
*  Russia delivering one of the most significant blows of [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=248.44s)]
*  The war comes of course as the Ukrainians and Russians are set to meet this week in Istanbul for the next round of peace talks [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=251.64000000000001s)]
*  So with this new with what happened over the weekend at the front of mind [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=258.28s)]
*  What are your thoughts about what President Trump should be doing in terms of this conflict? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=262.72s)]
*  We've yet to hear from him on [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=267.8s)]
*  What Ukraine did over the weekend, but we know at times he has been sharply critical of [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=269.92s)]
*  President Zelensky and unwilling to really punish Putin for not taking a ceasefire [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=275.8s)]
*  Well, you know, he seems all over the lot one day. He praises Putin the next day. He criticizes Putin [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=281.68s)]
*  He's not made it clear that we're in Zelensky's corner [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=287.6s)]
*  I hope on Ukraine the president's not the taco president [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=291.44s)]
*  Trump always [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=296.88s)]
*  Loses the fight Trump always cops out is what taco stands for [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=299.92s)]
*  And what we should be doing we should be much tougher on Putin [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=305.04s)]
*  There's a bill in the Senate led by Lindsey Graham one of Trump's great allies who's getting fed up [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=308.52000000000004s)]
*  I think even with Trump on this issue that would impose really tough sanctions on Russia [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=313.88s)]
*  Putin's a bully unless we're tough with him. He is going to continue [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=319.92s)]
*  To wage war on Ukraine. He viciously kills civilians the move that Ukraine made was brilliant yesterday [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=324.64000000000004s)]
*  But it was aimed at military targets. Some have called it the Pearl Harbor of Russia and [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=331.7s)]
*  the only way he under [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=339.14s)]
*  Understands toughness so we have to number one do these sanctions 85 senators [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=341.65999999999997s)]
*  I believe including myself and senator Thune are co-sponsors of this [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=347.02s)]
*  Legislation and we also have to make sure their air defenses are strong and we supply them with the military needs [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=351.62s)]
*  They need to fight back [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=357.74s)]
*  So senator Elon Musk is sharing his opinions on the Trump administration in a new interview that aired over the weekend the billionaire and [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=359.74s)]
*  Tesla CEO spoke with CBS Sunday morning and at first said he wanted to keep the subject on [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=367.18s)]
*  Spaceships, but then he began to talk about his time at the White House [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=373.54s)]
*  Sharing that he does not always agree with everything the Trump administration does [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=378.14s)]
*  Wondering what your thought is on the ban on foreign students the proposal [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=383.54s)]
*  You were one of those kids, right? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=388.26s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I think we want to stick to you know the [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=391.78s)]
*  subject of the day which is like spaceships [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=395.86s)]
*  As opposed to you know presidential policy. Oh, okay [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=398.58s)]
*  I was told [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=403.65999999999997s)]
*  Anything's good, but no well [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=405.34s)]
*  No [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=408.94s)]
*  It's not like I agree with everything [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=411.14s)]
*  The administration does so it's like there's I mean I agree with much of what the administration does [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=413.53999999999996s)]
*  But we have differences of opinion [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=420.14s)]
*  you know I [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=422.62s)]
*  the things that I [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=423.97999999999996s)]
*  Don't entirely agree with [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=426.02s)]
*  But it's difficult for me to bring that up in an interview because then it creates a bone of contention [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=427.78s)]
*  So then I'm a little stuck in a bind where I'm like well. I don't want to you know speak up against the administration [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=432.38s)]
*  but I don't want to [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=440.02s)]
*  Also, don't want to take responsibility for everything the administration is doing [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=443.5s)]
*  So he says he's in a bind the American people are in a bind because of what Musk did his doge [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=447.78s)]
*  Which you know? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=456.06s)]
*  Didn't go it didn't do as much as he wanted it to do [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=458.34s)]
*  But still did huge amounts of damage in terms of the firing of employees the decimation of agencies like health care [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=461.74s)]
*  like going after [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=469.41999999999996s)]
*  Making sure drugs and food is safe nuclear energy is safe the FAA [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=471.86s)]
*  We need to bolster and he I believe they put a freeze on it [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=477.5s)]
*  They didn't hire new people over and over again what Musk did with his doge is going to cause lasting damage [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=481.7s)]
*  To the American people and just saying now. He's out of the administration, and he's in a bind [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=489.14s)]
*  That's that's ridiculous [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=493.94s)]
*  He ought to be apologizing to the American people for what he has done if for some reason he sees the light [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=495.66s)]
*  I don't know if he does or not [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=501.62s)]
*  But that's what we need an apology and him to tell Trump to undo the damage that he has done [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=502.74s)]
*  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Thank you very much for coming on the show this morning. We appreciate it [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=510.3s)]
*  We'll be watching what happens there on Capitol Hill and [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=515.7s)]
*  You [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ZVqLc7ao8&t=525.62s)]
