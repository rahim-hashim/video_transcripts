# 'An existential moment': Why cuts to PBS could have major consequences
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw)
*  The CEOs of PBS and NPR say they are preparing to mount a legal challenge against President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump's executive order cutting their funding. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=7.88s)]
*  That federal funding, which has already been appropriated by Congress, accounts for 1 percent [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=11.92s)]
*  of NPR's annual budget, but roughly 15 percent of PBS's yearly revenue. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=16.68s)]
*  Joining us now, the CEO of PBS, Paula Kerger. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=24.32s)]
*  She recently co-authored a piece with filmmaker Ken Burns for The Hill entitled America at [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=28.72s)]
*  250. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=34.96s)]
*  Why we need public media now more than ever. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=36.28s)]
*  It's great for you to come on the show. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  I'd love to get a sense of the legal pushback here, if you could. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=43.04s)]
*  Some might say, especially those in the Trump administration might say, if something is [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=49.22s)]
*  truly independent, why does it need government funding? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=53.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=56.78s)]
*  So, we actually are in the midst of several challenges right now. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=57.78s)]
*  The first challenge was around the FCC, and we're in the middle right now of providing [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=63.78s)]
*  all of the information the FCC has required, questioning whether we are appropriately running [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=69.12s)]
*  sponsorship messages. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=77.02s)]
*  This latest executive order is what we're now working on. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=79.06s)]
*  That landed late Thursday night, and we're now working to map out a challenge against [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=82.8s)]
*  that that would cripple our ability to serve our stations. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=88.82000000000001s)]
*  It would cripple our ability to provide stations with the content that they rely upon. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=93.02000000000001s)]
*  And then on Friday night, we received word that our grant program that supports our kids' [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=99.14s)]
*  has also been canceled. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=106.08s)]
*  And that is in response to the executive order. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  So I think it's really important as we look at the path forward, as we look at serving [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=110.03999999999999s)]
*  the country, as we look at programs like Ken's upcoming series on the American Revolution, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=116.16s)]
*  which is broadcasting later this year, that we have the ability to serve our communities [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=120.8s)]
*  across the country. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=126.36s)]
*  Paula, we mentioned there that PBS gets about 15 percent of its funding from the federal [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=127.36s)]
*  government, but of course, it's not 15 percent everywhere. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=131.96s)]
*  There are some communities, some stations that rely much more heavily on federal money. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=134.24s)]
*  What does it mean for audiences, for voters, for Democrats and Republicans, for Americans [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=138.88s)]
*  in those communities if they lose their PBS station? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=144.48s)]
*  So what you have to remember is the federal appropriation is largely intended for our [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=147.92s)]
*  stations. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=152.24s)]
*  It was envisioned when LBJ signed the Public Broadcasting Act that every community in this [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=153.24s)]
*  country should be entitled to a public broadcasting station, and there would be some communities [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=157.68s)]
*  that would need some federal support to enable those stations to exist. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=162.79999999999998s)]
*  And so the 15 percent number is an aggregate number. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=166.64s)]
*  Some of our stations receive a smaller portion of their budget, five or six or seven percent, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=169.07999999999998s)]
*  but there are stations in this country that the federal appropriation represents up to [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=173.88s)]
*  50 percent of their budget. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=178.16s)]
*  And for those stations, this is really an existential moment. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=179.79999999999998s)]
*  If that funding does not continue, if we're not able to support those stations, they really [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=183.28s)]
*  would be challenged to move forward. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=189.32s)]
*  And I think that, you know, as we are really trying to ensure that everyone has access, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=192.51999999999998s)]
*  I've traveled a lot since I've been in this job. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=197.95999999999998s)]
*  I've visited not all 330, but many of them. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=199.88s)]
*  And what I will tell you is that for so many stations that I visit, the local public television [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=203.56s)]
*  stations and public radio stations are the last remaining locally owned, operated and [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=209.12s)]
*  governed media organizations. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=213.68s)]
*  These are news deserts that are served beautifully by public media. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=215.68s)]
*  And that's why we were created, was to close those market gaps that the commercial media [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=219.84s)]
*  landscape is not able to fulfill. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=224.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=226.12s)]
*  In an area of growing misinformation, we need reliable news sources even more than we ever [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=227.12s)]
*  have. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=232.84s)]
*  How much leverage do you have, and how much do you think the American public and viewers [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=233.84s)]
*  will raise their voices if these cuts go through? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=238.72s)]
*  Well, I know that in the last week, more than a million people have called, emailed or texted [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=242.32s)]
*  their members of Congress. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=248.16s)]
*  This is something people do care about. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=249.68s)]
*  People care everywhere I go. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=252.04s)]
*  People talk to me about how their childhood was enriched by PBS. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=253.68s)]
*  They talk about the role that we play in their communities. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=258.2s)]
*  They talk about the great work of people like Ken, but they also talk about series like [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=261.52s)]
*  Frontline and American Experience and Nova and Nature, and how valuable it is to them. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=266.52s)]
*  And so, look, I was on a panel last week. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=273.03999999999996s)]
*  I followed Speaker Johnson. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=275.91999999999996s)]
*  He said, look, I think they should make their case to the American people. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=277.91999999999996s)]
*  And so that's what we're doing. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=281.24s)]
*  We're asking people if they care about this to let their elected officials know. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=282.79999999999995s)]
*  Paula, just picking up on that point you made there and all of the extraordinary shows that [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=286.56s)]
*  you broadcasted over the years that you broadcast now from Sesame Street to Frontline and everywhere [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=291.09999999999997s)]
*  and everything in between, I think this is a time of sort of reminding people about the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=296.5s)]
*  institutions of our country, and I count PBS among those. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=301.38s)]
*  So you've come under attack from the president himself saying PBS is radical left and all [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=304.7s)]
*  of the things he's been saying, trying to hurt our country. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=309.62s)]
*  So as you see it and as you've seen it in your long tenure there, what is the mission [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=312.6s)]
*  of PBS? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=317.32s)]
*  Well, I always like to say, you know, although we're a media organization, we're actually [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=318.32s)]
*  in a slightly different business. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=322.78s)]
*  We use the same tools as everyone else, but our focus is really not just to entertain, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=324.78s)]
*  but we're hoping that the content that we're producing is also educating and inspiring. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=330.85999999999996s)]
*  And I think at a moment when we're looking at ways to bring our country together, it [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=336.46s)]
*  is institutions like PBS that are very focused on community. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=340.21999999999997s)]
*  And that's our mission. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=345.17999999999995s)]
*  That has been our core mission from when we were created, and it continues to be our mission [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=347.02s)]
*  today. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=351.82s)]
*  So this is again why we are fighting so vigorously to ensure that our local stations across the [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=352.86s)]
*  country have the ability to do the work that communities have valued for so many years. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=358.26s)]
*  For sure. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=364.18s)]
*  PBS CEO Paula Kerger, thank you so much for coming on the show this morning. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=365.18s)]
*  Really appreciate it. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=370.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1qcCZ40EJw&t=371.86s)]
