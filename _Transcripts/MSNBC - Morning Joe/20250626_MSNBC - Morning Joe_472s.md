# 'Largest single Patriot engagement in U.S. military history': Gen. Dan Caine on Iran strikes
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w)
*  Good morning. Thank you, Mr. Secretary, and good morning, and all of you. Thank you for being here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=0.0s)]
*  As a follow-up to my comments on Sunday's press conference, I wanted to give you a few updates this morning [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=5.44s)]
*  on something I'm honored to do as the chairman, and that's a chance to get to talk about some of our service members [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=11.44s)]
*  and the incredible things that they do on behalf of our nation. And I apologize ahead of time for the length and the detail. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=17.76s)]
*  Today I'm going to brief you on a couple things. First, I'm going to talk about our air defenders at Al Udeid in Qatar and their actions on Monday. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=25.68s)]
*  Then I'm going to walk you through a little bit about the academics that went into the attack against Fordow, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=33.2s)]
*  the massive ordnance penetrator weapon, and we're going to show a video that highlights the effects that that weapon has. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=39.28s)]
*  Of course, nobody was down inside the target, so we don't have video from the target. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=47.08s)]
*  First, on Monday, as the president has stated, on Monday morning, we began to receive indications and warnings [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=52.28s)]
*  that Iran intended to attack U.S. bases in the region. That morning, building on the work that CENTCOM Commander Eric Carrillo had done, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=58.92s)]
*  and on the orders of the president, Al Udeid, at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar and around the region, we assumed a minimum force posture. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=69.56s)]
*  Most folks had moved off the base to extend the security perimeter out away from what we assessed might be a target zone, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=78.12s)]
*  except for a very few army soldiers at Al Udeid. At that point, only two Patriot batteries remained on base, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  roughly 44 American soldiers responsible for defending the entire base to include CENTCOM's forward headquarters [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=97.44s)]
*  in the Middle East, an entire air base, and all the U.S. forces there. The oldest soldier was a 28-year-old captain. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=107.08000000000001s)]
*  The youngest was a 21-year-old private who'd been in the military for less than two years. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=116.52000000000001s)]
*  So let's put ourselves out there for a second. Imagine you're that young First Lieutenant, you're 25 or 26 years old, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=123.64000000000001s)]
*  and you've been assigned as the tactical director inside the command and control element. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=132.16s)]
*  You, at that age, are the sole person responsible to defend this base. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=138.32s)]
*  Listening next to you is your early warning operator whose job is to notify you of imminent attack. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=144.96s)]
*  There's five people inside a vehicle and five people outside of a vehicle around these total of, as I said, 44. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=151.36s)]
*  By the way, you've sat in the Middle East for years, deployed over and over again, extended multiple times, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=160.23999999999998s)]
*  always being prepared but unsure of when that particular day will come that you must execute your mission and not fail at doing it. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=169.51999999999998s)]
*  In this case, these Patriot crews were deployed from Korea and Japan as part of our U.S. forces there [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=179.6s)]
*  to ensure that we had the most capable missiles in the CENTCOM area of responsibility. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=186.51999999999998s)]
*  As the day continues, you start to hear more and more chatter in the information space about a pending attack. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  And as the sun starts to set in the west, you get orders from your higher headquarters to make sure that your missile batteries are pointed to the north. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=201.0s)]
*  There are just a few other teammates. It's hot. You're getting nervous. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=211.76s)]
*  And you expect an attack. Outside of those Patriot vehicles, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=216.32000000000002s)]
*  your hot crew, which is one NCO and four additional soldiers, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=221.48000000000002s)]
*  turns the key and relinquishes control of those missiles to that young lieutenant inside the vehicle. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=225.68s)]
*  And you wait. You know that you're going to have approximately two minutes, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=233.0s)]
*  120 seconds to either succeed or fail. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=238.04000000000002s)]
*  And then at approximately 1230 p.m. on Monday, that's 730 p.m. in Qatar, as the sun sets in the west, Iran attacks. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=243.2s)]
*  As the targets were detected, round after round of Patriot missiles are ejected from their canisters by an initial launch charge. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=255.16s)]
*  Then the main solid rocket motor ignites. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=264.91999999999996s)]
*  You can feel this in your body if you've ever been around a Patriot taking a shot. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=267.71999999999997s)]
*  And round after round goes out and guides against those missiles coming inbound. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=272.6s)]
*  We believe that this is the largest single Patriot engagement in U.S. military history. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=277.76000000000005s)]
*  And we were joined in this engagement by the Qatari Patriot crews. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=284.92s)]
*  I'm not going to tell you how many rounds were shot, but it was a bunch because of classified purposes. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=291.28000000000003s)]
*  And we're aware that something there's reports of something getting through. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=297.20000000000005s)]
*  What we do know is there was a lot of metal flying around between attacking missiles being hit by Patriots, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=300.68s)]
*  boosters from attacking missiles being hit by Patriots, the Patriots themselves flying around. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=308.44s)]
*  And the debris from those Patriots hitting the ground, there was a lot of metal flying around. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=314.56s)]
*  And yet our U.S. air defenders had only seconds to make complex decisions with strategic impact. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=320.03999999999996s)]
*  These awesome humans, along with their Qatari brothers and sisters in arms, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=327.44s)]
*  stood between a salvo of Iranian missiles and the safety of Al Udeid. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=332.4s)]
*  They are the unsung heroes of the 21st century United States Army. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=337.91999999999996s)]
*  And I know a lot of you have seen the videos online and the excitement as those Patriots [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=343.03999999999996s)]
*  departed their launchers and went up and guided. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=348.15999999999997s)]
*  This really demonstrates the combat capability and [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=351.88s)]
*  capacity of our Army air defenders simply stated they absolutely crushed it. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=356.2s)]
*  If you'd flip this over, thanks. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=363.84000000000003s)]
*  Let me next move to a walk through of the GBU-57 massive ordinance penetrator weapon and [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=365.48s)]
*  share a little bit about the planners who did this and their work on the weapon. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=372.88s)]
*  First, let me set the stage for you. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=380.91999999999996s)]
*  There's an organization in the U.S. called the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, DITRA. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=384.91999999999996s)]
*  DITRA does a lot of things for our nation, but [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=391.4s)]
*  DITRA is the world's leading expert on deeply buried underground targets. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=394.88s)]
*  In 2009, a Defense Threat Reduction Agency officer was brought into a vault at an undisclosed [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=401.15999999999997s)]
*  location and briefed on something going on in Iran. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=408.84000000000003s)]
*  For security purposes, I'm not going to share his name. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=412.84000000000003s)]
*  He was shown some photos and some highly classified intelligence of what looked like a major [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=416.24s)]
*  construction project in the mountains of Iran. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=421.24s)]
*  He was tasked to study this facility, work with the intelligence community to understand [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=424.56s)]
*  it, and he was soon joined by an additional teammate. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=429.6s)]
*  For more than 15 years, this officer and his teammate lived and breathed this single target, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=433.52s)]
*  Fordow, a critical element of Iran's covert nuclear weapons program. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdF4DyKX7w&t=440.56s)]
