# 'There will be no safe spaces': Trump officials reverse guidance on immigration raids
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI)
*  The Department of Homeland Security is reportedly reversing guidance to pause immigration raids [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=0.0s)]
*  at farms, hotels and restaurants after the president said he was willing to exempt the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  industries from his nationwide immigration crackdown. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  According to the Washington Post, ICE officials told agents they must continue the sweeps [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=16.6s)]
*  after hearing from DHS leadership that the White House does not support an exemption [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=21.94s)]
*  policy. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=28.4s)]
*  An assistant secretary for DHS said yesterday, quote, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=30.04s)]
*  Work site enforcement remains a cornerstone of its immigration crackdown efforts, and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=33.32s)]
*  there are no, quote, safe spaces for industries. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=39.92s)]
*  The paper also reports White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, an architect [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=44.0s)]
*  of Trump's immigration policy, privately opposed carving out exemptions for certain industries [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=49.12s)]
*  that rely heavily on workers without legal status, according to two people with knowledge [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=55.76s)]
*  of his advocacy in recent days. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  So, Mike, this is yet another divide in the MAGA coalition. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=64.75999999999999s)]
*  You've got the Steve Bannon wing versus the billionaires, represented by Elon Musk. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  We've also seen this, of course, in the last story we did, which is the isolationists versus [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=81.16s)]
*  sort of the Reagan conservatives, people that come out of the traditional Republican wing [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=85.92s)]
*  on being for things like freedom. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=90.8s)]
*  And then in this case, you have a lot of business owners, a lot of farmers, a lot of people [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=95.64s)]
*  in restaurants versus the Stephen Miller wing of the MAGA base. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=102.0s)]
*  They're basically saying, we can't do our jobs here. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=109.56s)]
*  We can't provide Americans the food they need. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=115.4s)]
*  We can't keep the restaurants open without immigrants. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=119.02000000000001s)]
*  And we see that divide playing out time and time again, and you have the president going [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=124.16s)]
*  back and forth trying to appease both bases of his own base, both wings of his own base, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=128.06s)]
*  and in some cases, in these three issues, you just, you can't split the baby. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=135.2s)]
*  Joe, there is a significant difference in the distance between the tough-talking policy [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=140.2s)]
*  in the West Wing, led by Mr. Miller, and actual life, the way real-life Americans live their [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=145.79999999999998s)]
*  lives. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=152.39999999999998s)]
*  People working in nursing homes who don't have the proper papers, people working in [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=154.51999999999998s)]
*  restaurants, people working in meatpacking plants, people doing yard work for the wealthy [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=158.64s)]
*  or ordinary people in this country, the distance between actual life, the way life is lived [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=163.79999999999998s)]
*  and the way life needs to be lived in this country to keep it going is really significant. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=169.79999999999998s)]
*  And Jonathan, Martin, I don't know about you, but you keep hearing from people anecdotally [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=174.72s)]
*  the fact that they're shocked with ICE officers crashing through car windows to drag people [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=180.76s)]
*  out and the difference between, you know, working people, people who do jobs that Americans [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=185.48s)]
*  don't like to do, who are here without the proper documentation, people are now starting, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=191.44s)]
*  at least the people I speak to or bump into, are wondering about the toughness of this [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=196.88s)]
*  policy. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=201.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's one thing to have people letting cars on fire in L.A. It's a wholly different [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=202.08s)]
*  topic politically when you're talking about yanking folks from a Home Depot or from a [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=207.0s)]
*  home or from a business where they've been working for decades and decades in this country, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=212.52s)]
*  and I think the politics of that, Trump came to recognize last week. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=217.52s)]
*  But guys, we're seeing in real time here how you try to run a railroad when the conductor [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=221.68s)]
*  really has no core, has no true north, right? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=228.20000000000002s)]
*  So Trump catches flak last week from the ag industry and the hospitality industry and [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=231.8s)]
*  says, all right, we're going to stop cracking down on ag and hospitality, which of course [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=237.52s)]
*  humiliates Stephen Miller, totally undermines his personal project, but that's Trump. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=242.72s)]
*  There is no conviction here. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=248.08s)]
*  And then he now walks it back to full Stephen Millerism because he was embarrassed by the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=249.48000000000002s)]
*  coverage and he didn't look like a tough guy. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=254.92000000000002s)]
*  So that's what we're dealing with here, which is two turns of a policy in less than a week [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=257.62s)]
*  entirely because Trump is responsive to whatever the last stimuli is, whether it was input [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=262.32s)]
*  from the hospitality and the ag industry or whether it was then the coverage of his [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=268.08s)]
*  flip flop, which embarrassed him and caused him to go back to the original policy. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=272.35999999999996s)]
*  That's what we're dealing with here. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=276.4s)]
*  But the folks paying a price for it, of course, are those who are relying upon labor that [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=277.4s)]
*  they cannot get Americans to do. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=283.52s)]
*  And I think that that makes us a much different story than it is going after gang bangers [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=286.03999999999996s)]
*  and folks who are committing crimes in this country, where there's overwhelming support [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=292.15999999999997s)]
*  for deporting those people. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=296.8s)]
*  The numbers are just not there when you're talking about people who are in this country [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=298.32s)]
*  illegally but doing jobs and not otherwise breaking laws. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEPhG8T8biI&t=301.76s)]
