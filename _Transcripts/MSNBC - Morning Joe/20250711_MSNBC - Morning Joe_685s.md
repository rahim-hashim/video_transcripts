# Iran could recover some uranium, but Israel is watching, Israeli official says
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [July 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk)
*  Let's get to our top story this morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=0.0s)]
*  This morning, we have new information on last month's operation in Iran, targeting the country's [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=2.4s)]
*  nuclear facilities. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=8.18s)]
*  Citing a senior Israeli government official, NBC's Andrea Mitchell reports Israel believes [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=10.28s)]
*  at least some of Iran's highly enriched uranium at one of its sites was not destroyed in the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=14.76s)]
*  U.S. air strikes targeting the base. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=21.72s)]
*  However, that official tells NBC News that uranium is buried deep beneath the facility [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=24.68s)]
*  and is effectively unreachable. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=30.52s)]
*  The official says Israel is monitoring activity closely, and if Iran is seen trying to recover [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=33.26s)]
*  the material, Israel will not hesitate to carry out new strikes. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=38.92s)]
*  Let's bring it around. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=44.08s)]
*  The President of the United States of America and the Council on Foreign Relations, Richard [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=45.08s)]
*  Haass, he's the author of the weekly newsletter Home and Away on Substack. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=47.0s)]
*  Also, morning Joe's official golf analyst, maybe, we'll see if he wants to talk about [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=50.44s)]
*  tennis. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=55.16s)]
*  Also, managing editor at the Bulwark, Sam Stein, who's going to be stepping in talking [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=56.16s)]
*  about all things Red Sox in the middle of a seven-game winning streak. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=60.959999999999994s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=65.32s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=66.32s)]
*  It is amazing. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=67.32s)]
*  Richard, so it's very interesting details coming out of this Israeli intelligence. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=69.32s)]
*  That is that not all the uranium was destroyed, but it is rendered ineffective right now because [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=76.7s)]
*  it's buried. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=82.66s)]
*  And if the Iranians go after it, well, that may be the last thing they do. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=84.06s)]
*  Tell us what you know. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=88.42s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's two takeaways in this. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=89.42s)]
*  One is the strikes were pretty effective in terms of knocking out thousands of centrifuges [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=92.14s)]
*  and probably making it difficult, if not impossible, to reach all this enriched uranium. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=98.14s)]
*  That's the good news. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=103.94s)]
*  The president's favorite word is probably a step too far, in part because some things [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=107.38000000000001s)]
*  may have survived. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=111.9s)]
*  And more important, there's parts of the program that were never there to begin with. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=112.9s)]
*  And I think what we're looking at is a future, Joe, and I think this is the bottom line, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=117.58000000000001s)]
*  where this is a problem that's been diminished. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=121.54s)]
*  It's program was set back but not eliminated. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=124.34s)]
*  And one has to assume that the big takeaway in Iran will be, hey, we need nuclear weapons [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=127.18s)]
*  in order to deter the Americans and the Israelis from ever doing anything like this again. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=132.46s)]
*  So my guess is we're looking at a future where the Iranians slowly, in all sorts of decentralized [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=137.44s)]
*  ways, try to rebuild a program. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=143.58s)]
*  Easier said than done, it will take more time. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=146.22s)]
*  But my guess is this is not the last time we will have used military force, either we [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=148.78s)]
*  or the Israelis, will have used military force against Iran's nuclear program. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=153.10000000000002s)]
*  I can imagine six months from now, six years from now, there'll be new intelligence about [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=157.5s)]
*  some equipment or material in some location. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=162.24s)]
*  And if it can't be resolved diplomatically, I think once again you'll see military action [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=166.4s)]
*  called in against Iran. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=171.88s)]
*  So Richard, let's talk about that potential diplomacy here. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=175.16s)]
*  We're talking about the specifics of how effective that attack was. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=179.52s)]
*  But let's talk geopolitically about the aims of that attack to try to bring Iran to the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=182.74s)]
*  negotiating table, to bring Iran to heel in some ways. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=187.64000000000001s)]
*  How effective was it there? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=191.44s)]
*  What do you expect to see now? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=193.04s)]
*  Well, it's tough because Iran has stopped cooperation with the international weapons [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=194.52s)]
*  inspectors. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=198.8s)]
*  So that obviously works against diplomacy. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=199.98s)]
*  We'd have to be willing to relieve sanctions. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=203.2s)]
*  I think that's probably the big Iranian ask at this point because their economy is in [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=205.84s)]
*  rough shape and the regime is focused right now. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=209.56s)]
*  Priority number one for this regime is shoring itself up, among other things, getting economic [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=212.8s)]
*  sanctions relief would help there. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=217.52s)]
*  So I think there's a possibility for some diplomacy. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=219.56s)]
*  I think you'd call it a long shot either to reach an agreement and then also to implement [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=222.2s)]
*  an agreement and stay true to it over time rather than have, say, the Iranians trying [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=226.92000000000002s)]
*  to work around it. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=231.76s)]
*  So I think it's fine to pursue the diplomatic approach, and we will. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=234.72s)]
*  But I just think it's unrealistic to think that it's going to solve the problem for all [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=238.2s)]
*  time going forward. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=244.78s)]
*  So the Wall Street Journal editorial board is writing about this with a new piece entitled [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=247.3s)]
*  What's Trump's Next Move on Iran? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=250.98000000000002s)]
*  It reads in part, quote, The aftermath of the 12-day war with Iran looks mixed more [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=253.78s)]
*  than two weeks later. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=260.34000000000003s)]
*  Iran's nuclear program was badly damaged and likely set back for years, but the Ayatollah's [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=262.78000000000003s)]
*  government isn't admitting defeat and shows no signs of dropping its revolutionary or [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=267.84000000000003s)]
*  nuclear designs. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=273.74s)]
*  Iran will surrender the remains of its enrichment program. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=276.02s)]
*  Iran has driven out United Nations weapons inspectors who left the country last week. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=280.97999999999996s)]
*  It may drop out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=286.34s)]
*  That will make it impossible for inspectors to make a ground-level estimate of the damage [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=290.5s)]
*  done and track or collect any nuclear material that remains. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=295.06s)]
*  Iran isn't hankering for normal relations with the West either. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=300.21999999999997s)]
*  The successful U.S. military operation has the regime more vulnerable than at any time [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=304.42s)]
*  since the Islamic Revolution. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=310.90000000000003s)]
*  Now is the moment to capitalize for a safer Middle East. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=313.84000000000003s)]
*  The question is how, when? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=319.38s)]
*  Well the question also is what is the, Sam, what's the political possibility of doing [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=321.86s)]
*  this and having, you know, the majority of people in Congress or in America supporting [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=327.62s)]
*  you? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=332.58000000000004s)]
*  I just want to say, you know, I think the Iranian sights should have been struck. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=333.74s)]
*  I actually, I agree with the president and with those that he succeeded over the past [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=339.18s)]
*  25 years. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=347.41999999999996s)]
*  Iran can't have a nuclear program. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=348.41999999999996s)]
*  That said, I may be in the minority when it comes to American voters on what they're willing [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=351.29999999999995s)]
*  to have the United States do to stop that from happening. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=359.9s)]
*  And part of that is, you know, it used to be Democrats would be against, most Democrats [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=363.94s)]
*  would be against a military operation. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=370.98s)]
*  Most Republicans would support that military operation. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=373.3s)]
*  I guess this is the old Republican in me coming out. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=376.09999999999997s)]
*  But it is so mixed, isn't it, Sam? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=379.53999999999996s)]
*  It is really, it's hard to follow exactly the ebb and the flow of the MAGA base, people [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=381.86s)]
*  on the left who support Israel, some of those who support. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=388.82s)]
*  It's really hard to tell how much support there'd be for the president going back and [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=393.86s)]
*  striking Iran again. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=397.54s)]
*  Yeah, I actually don't think you'd be in the minority. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=399.54s)]
*  I think people view this through a nuanced lens. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=402.62s)]
*  But I do think, if I'm understanding it correctly, that there's a lot of hesitation for over [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=405.38s)]
*  engagement in the country. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=409.22s)]
*  And look, I, at the bulwark, we wrote about this with a varying degree of opinions. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=411.06s)]
*  But I think generally we were supportive of the strikes for the purposes of getting rid [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=416.62s)]
*  of or at least setting back the nuclear program. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=421.65999999999997s)]
*  But the question I suppose now is at what cost, right? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=424.21999999999997s)]
*  Did we set back diplomatic efforts with Iran as well? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=427.09999999999997s)]
*  And then I think Richard really hit on the more important question is, did we lose visibility [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=429.82s)]
*  into what Iranian nuclear program objectives were and what's happening on the ground going [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=434.7s)]
*  forward? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=440.09999999999997s)]
*  Because frankly, Iran's going to try to reconstitute their program. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=441.09999999999997s)]
*  Obviously, we know that they've said so. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=443.82s)]
*  If they do it in secret, if they pop up in three or four months and say, hey, we've actually [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=445.97999999999996s)]
*  accelerated, did we actually accomplish what we set out to do with these strikes? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=449.5s)]
*  This is all by way of saying this is an incredibly nuanced, difficult geopolitical question to [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=455.1s)]
*  tackle. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=461.14s)]
*  My sense is that the Trump administration actually does at this point want to find some [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=462.14s)]
*  sort of diplomatic path forward. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=467.22s)]
*  Trump has hinted at it. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=469.62s)]
*  They've had negotiations. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=472.46s)]
*  They've want to get them back. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=473.46s)]
*  They've actually dangled the idea of sanction relief on Iranian oil. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=474.7s)]
*  It hasn't come to fruition yet. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=479.3s)]
*  But I wouldn't be totally surprised if the Trump administration starts pursuing more [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=481.94s)]
*  aggressively a diplomatic resolution to maybe stabilize the region a little bit. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=486.22s)]
*  And I do agree with you. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=492.34000000000003s)]
*  I think there's a lot of hesitation in the MAGA base out there about more and more military [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=493.46s)]
*  engagement. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=498.74s)]
*  And so it might not be, it might have worked this time in terms of politically striking [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=499.74s)]
*  Iran. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=503.98s)]
*  I'm not totally sure how much more he can go back to that well. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=504.98s)]
*  You know, Richard, it's very interesting. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=508.34s)]
*  We were talking yesterday about interpreting what the president said when he seems to say [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=510.7s)]
*  things that are either conflicting or ambiguous regarding his secretary of defense. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=514.9399999999999s)]
*  If you sort through it, it's actually not too ambiguous at all what he was saying here. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=521.1s)]
*  The same thing with Iran, where he said several things. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=525.6999999999999s)]
*  But I'm wondering if your read on President Trump on this issue is the same as mine. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=529.18s)]
*  He said two weeks and then he attacked. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=536.4599999999999s)]
*  And that was clearly a fake afterwards. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=539.4599999999999s)]
*  He said, oh, I'm not going to even think about this after this week. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=541.38s)]
*  Something along those lines didn't really mean that, though. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=545.66s)]
*  He's had some statements afterwards basically pushing the Iranians, saying, you know, you [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=549.14s)]
*  need to play this smart. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=555.02s)]
*  You need to deal with this. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=557.5s)]
*  I'm curious, what you think the president's current... [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=558.66s)]
*  And by the way, that's the take of most Arab leaders right now is, yeah, the president [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=561.5799999999999s)]
*  is not going to let Iran off the hook, at least the Arab leaders I talked to. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=565.98s)]
*  I'm curious, though, where you believe the president is right now on deterring this nuclear [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=570.02s)]
*  risk moving forward. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=575.66s)]
*  One, and two, what you would advise this president or any other president in this position to do? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=577.1s)]
*  I would probably do a two-prong policy, Joe. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=585.78s)]
*  I would explore it diplomatically, and I think that will be the president's inclination. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=588.0600000000001s)]
*  He always likes... [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=591.78s)]
*  He's attracted to the big diplomatic deal. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=593.26s)]
*  So I would put on the table a grand bargain, if you will, with Iran and lay it out in terms [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=596.9s)]
*  of support for proxies, put the priority on not reconstituting their nuclear program. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=601.94s)]
*  It would require getting international weapons inspectors back in, offer them sanctions relief. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=607.34s)]
*  And I think there's a chance. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=612.14s)]
*  I don't think that's far-fetched, because again, the Iranian regime is something on [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=613.38s)]
*  the ropes. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=617.38s)]
*  Think about it. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=618.38s)]
*  They've had a terrible year and a half, two years since October 7th. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=619.38s)]
*  It has been economically and strategically a fiasco for the Iranian regime. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=622.7s)]
*  A lot of their senior people have been assassinated. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=627.74s)]
*  So I don't think it's out of the question that they would accept a deal. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=630.34s)]
*  And then on the back burner, you have the military option. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=634.46s)]
*  And it's not going to war with Iran. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=637.72s)]
*  Again, it would be discrete strikes, kind of like Israel and the United States did. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=639.1800000000001s)]
*  So I think if the president combines the two, a good-faith diplomatic approach that's demanding [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=643.36s)]
*  but not inconceivable, puts aside regime change, and has in his back pocket the possibility [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=649.06s)]
*  of renewed military force, I think that's worth pursuing, and I hope he goes for it. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gld0g2XIcOk&t=654.6199999999999s)]
