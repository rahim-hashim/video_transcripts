# ‘Got it exactly wrong’: Joe slams Texas gov. for reaction to questions about flood warning systems
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4)
*  You ask, I'm going to use your words. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=0.0s)]
*  Who's to blame? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=4.3s)]
*  Know this. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=5.94s)]
*  That's the word choice of losers. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=7.5s)]
*  Let me explain one thing about Texas. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=11.06s)]
*  And that is Texas, every square inch of our [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=13.58s)]
*  state cares about football. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=16.9s)]
*  You could be in Hunt, Texas, Huntsville, Texas, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=19.86s)]
*  Houston, Texas, any size community [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=22.34s)]
*  that care about football. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=24.900000000000002s)]
*  High school, Friday night lights, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=26.18s)]
*  college football or pro. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=28.62s)]
*  And know this, every football team makes mistakes. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=30.54s)]
*  The losing teams are the ones that try to point out [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=34.94s)]
*  who's to blame. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=37.44s)]
*  The championship teams are the ones that say, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=39.02s)]
*  don't worry about it, man, we got this. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=41.78s)]
*  We're going to make sure that we go score again [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=43.58s)]
*  that we're going to win this game. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=45.78s)]
*  The way winners talk is not to point fingers. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=47.540000000000006s)]
*  They talk about solutions. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=50.86s)]
*  What Texas is all about is solutions. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=52.66s)]
*  You know, Willie, we're going to get to the Russia story [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=56.02s)]
*  second, Willie, but I listened to the governor there. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=63.02s)]
*  No, I can already hear it. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=68.02000000000001s)]
*  Talking about football. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=70.02000000000001s)]
*  And he said the winning teams, like when they lose, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=72.02000000000001s)]
*  they go, come on, we're fine, everybody's fine, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=76.02000000000001s)]
*  we're going to get them next time. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=78.02000000000001s)]
*  Maybe they do that in Texas. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=82.02000000000001s)]
*  I don't think they do that in Texas. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=84.02s)]
*  I'll tell you what they do in the SEC. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=85.02s)]
*  You lose a football game, Bear Bryant will take you back [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=88.02s)]
*  into the locker room. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=94.02s)]
*  Nick Saban will take you back into the locker room. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=96.02s)]
*  And you'll hear about it nonstop about what you did wrong, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=100.02s)]
*  why you did it wrong, how you cost the team the game [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=106.02s)]
*  and how you never do it again. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=110.02s)]
*  In fact, Nick Saban actually, you can see Nick Saban, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=112.02s)]
*  he goes around and talks all the time about the importance [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=115.02s)]
*  of telling people when they make mistakes. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=119.02s)]
*  Saban said, if I don't go up and get in people's face [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=122.02s)]
*  and tell them when they've made a mistake, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=126.02s)]
*  I'm letting down the entire team. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=128.01999999999998s)]
*  It creates a culture that allows permissiveness, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=130.01999999999998s)]
*  that breeds mistakes, that makes a team worse, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=133.01999999999998s)]
*  and makes them repeat those mistakes weekend, week out, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=137.01999999999998s)]
*  so I don't even know. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=141.02s)]
*  He should not have brought up football. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=142.02s)]
*  That was so painful. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=144.02s)]
*  Because I'm pretty sure in Texas football, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=145.02s)]
*  it's a lot like Alabama football. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=148.02s)]
*  If you screw up, then there is immediate accountability. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=150.02s)]
*  And if you don't understand that, then you go out in Alabama [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=154.02s)]
*  or Northwest Florida and you run wind sprints. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=158.02s)]
*  And you keep running wind sprints. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=161.02s)]
*  And you run what we call red dogs in Northwest Florida. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=163.02s)]
*  You don't want to run red dogs in Northwest Florida. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=167.02s)]
*  So again, this whole thing, he's trying to hide behind [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=169.02s)]
*  Texas football, and he's trying to hide behind this tragedy [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=174.02s)]
*  to suggest we shouldn't be talking about accountability. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=180.02s)]
*  He's got it exactly wrong, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=183.02s)]
*  and the football metaphor underlines that. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=187.02s)]
*  Jonathan, Lear, and I were watching that. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=190.02s)]
*  We said that'll be news to Bill Belichick or Nick Saban [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=192.02s)]
*  that you don't go back and watch the game film. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=195.02s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=198.02s)]
*  Over and over again to see what mistakes you might have made. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=199.02s)]
*  And broadly, though, the idea of comparing to what we're watching [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=202.02s)]
*  in Texas and the death of all these people to high school football [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=206.02s)]
*  or any football or anything other than the complete tragedy that it is. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=209.02s)]
*  And to not look and say, you know what, we need tomorrow [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=214.02s)]
*  to start installing these warning systems along the Guadalupe River [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=217.02s)]
*  that should have been there a long time ago [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=221.02s)]
*  to prevent the next thing. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=223.02s)]
*  That's the right answer. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=224.02s)]
*  And I also understand the sentiment of, hey, we are busy now trying [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=225.02s)]
*  and find the bodies of these people and bring them home to their families [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=230.02s)]
*  so they can have funerals. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=233.02s)]
*  I get that. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=234.02s)]
*  But you are government officials. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=235.02s)]
*  You are elected officials. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=238.02s)]
*  Your responsibility is to the people, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=239.02s)]
*  and you need to figure out what happened [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=241.02s)]
*  and make sure it never happens again. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=243.02s)]
*  And that, yes, is what Nick Saban or the head coach at Texas [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=245.02s)]
*  or the Dallas Cowboys or at Permian East would tell you, too. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=248.02s)]
*  And that happens after every storm. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=252.02s)]
*  That happens after every tragedy. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=255.02s)]
*  They can do two things at one time. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=258.02s)]
*  They can do search and rescue. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=260.02s)]
*  They can care for those that are lost. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=262.02s)]
*  And they can also ask, how did this happen? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=265.02s)]
*  How do we prevent this from ever happening again? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=269.02s)]
*  It's not wrong to ask, and I can't even imagine [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=274.02s)]
*  what family members of those who were lost in this devastating tragedy [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=277.02s)]
*  were thinking and hearing the governor compare this question to football. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=284.02s)]
*  And say, please, don't even ask us any questions about how this happened. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=289.02s)]
*  Yeah, it was painful. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=294.02s)]
*  We're going to be continuing to cover the story throughout the show [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=295.02s)]
*  with Aaron Gilchrist and others on the scene. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=299.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5iUJtMEPT4&t=307.02s)]
