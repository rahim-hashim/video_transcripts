# 'A 90-day pause': Treasury Secretary on U.S. and China slashing reciprocal tariffs
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w)
*  With us now from Geneva, Switzerland, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessett. Mr. Secretary, thank [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=0.0s)]
*  you so much for being with us. You have been optimistic from the beginning. You have been [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=5.64s)]
*  reassuring Wall Street, reassuring business owners and entrepreneurs that these deals [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=10.66s)]
*  were going to be coming. Often you were ridiculed for being overly optimistic, but we had the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=19.88s)]
*  US-UK deal on Friday, followed by a British Airway deal with Boeing. And now some progress [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=27.08s)]
*  on China, which you had even said going into these talks were going to be far more difficult [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=34.16s)]
*  than not to expect any quick breakthroughs. And yet it looks like we have one. Tell us [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=38.56s)]
*  about the negotiations and where the deal stands right now. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=44.44s)]
*  Good morning, Joe. And what we have is a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs, both sides [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=50.160000000000004s)]
*  de-escalated by 115 percent. So we are both at 10 on the reciprocal tariffs. The fentanyl-related [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=56.940000000000005s)]
*  tariffs, which President Trump put on in February, are still on. And over the next 90 days, we [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=65.0s)]
*  have a mechanism to meet with the Chinese trade delegation again. We will be discussing [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=73.8s)]
*  tariffs, non-tariff trade barriers, currency, and their subsidies of labor and capital, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=80.6s)]
*  and how we can open up China to American businesses and rebalance what is our most imbalanced, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=90.97999999999999s)]
*  trading relationship. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=99.83999999999999s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, as you know far better than I do, in past years, even for those business [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=101.16s)]
*  leaders and economists who opposed tariffs, there was always sort of a caveat. And they [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=110.88s)]
*  go, yeah, we're against tariffs. That said, China really is taking advantage of the United [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=118.88s)]
*  States. I heard that from even the most fierce free traders. I'm wondering, with that in [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=124.52s)]
*  mind, what are your biggest challenges ahead? What is the administration's greatest challenges [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=129.12s)]
*  ahead in negotiating to make sure this goes where you want it to go, where the president [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=135.6s)]
*  wants it to go over the next 90 days? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=139.88s)]
*  Well, Joe, this is going to go where the president wants it to go. I was in touch with him over [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=143.32s)]
*  the weekend, and he wants free trade, free and fair trade. We've had free trade, and [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=149.68s)]
*  as you said, that has not worked for the American people. There's something called the China [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=157.0s)]
*  shock, which has gutted our manufacturing sector. And China has a different form of [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=161.76000000000002s)]
*  government for us. They have a different economic model where they subsidize labor, they subsidize [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=168.68s)]
*  capital goods, and they have exported that to us and the rest of the world. We have put [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=175.4s)]
*  up tariffs to push back on that. So it will be a matter of what is the equilibrium level [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=181.16s)]
*  on tariffs and also getting China to open their markets for American companies, because [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=188.76s)]
*  China actually has a low tariff regime, but it is the non tariff trade barriers that can [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=194.88s)]
*  be the most difficult to overcome. So we will be focusing on the non tariff trade barriers [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=201.44000000000003s)]
*  and the subsidies and the idea that China can become more open to American business [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=207.56s)]
*  and the things that are sold into the U.S. can not have the same level of subsidy. And [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=214.60000000000002s)]
*  no one wants to do a generalized decoupling, but we are going to do a strategic decoupling, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=224.4s)]
*  because we realized during COVID that efficient supply chains were not secure supply chains. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=229.76s)]
*  So with steel, with semiconductors, with medicines, with a couple of other strategic categories, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=236.76s)]
*  we are going to have to become self-reliant again. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=243.95999999999998s)]
*  So, we were just talking in the last block about how the drop of oil below $60 a barrel [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=247.76s)]
*  presents real economic challenges for Russia. I have read reports and I am curious your [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=255.76s)]
*  thoughts. I keep reading reports about how China is negotiating from a position of strength, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=263.03999999999996s)]
*  and yet everything I have read over the past five years, everything we have reported on [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=270.03999999999996s)]
*  over the past five years is China's economy is struggling as well. There have been a series [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=274.32s)]
*  of self-inflicted injuries from Xi to the Chinese economy. I am wondering what you [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=279.82s)]
*  say to those who say it is foolish to push China because they are negotiating from a [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=285.94s)]
*  position of strength when actually their economic numbers over the past five years would suggest [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=291.5s)]
*  they need a deal as much as anybody. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=298.58s)]
*  Well, Joe, what they are doing is during COVID, they moved up a little bit. They moved up [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=302.21999999999997s)]
*  the value chain in terms of their manufacturing sector, and they actually became more unbalanced. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=309.82s)]
*  So what we want China to do is to rebalance toward more consumption. Party Chairman Xi [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=316.65999999999997s)]
*  has talked about that, but they have not done it yet. Simultaneously, President Trump is [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=324.14s)]
*  rebalancing the U.S. economy toward more manufacturing. So, Joe, their economy is hurting, but the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=330.38s)]
*  remedy for that is not to export their deflation or their economic problems to the rest of [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=338.38s)]
*  the world. It is to increase domestic demand, and we could conceivably, away from strategic [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=346.38s)]
*  materials, do this together. We need more manufacturing. They need more consumption. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=354.38s)]
*  So there is a chance to rebalance together, so we will see if that is possible. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=360.38s)]
*  Mr. Treasury Secretary, good to see you. I wanted to take, if you would take us inside [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=366.38s)]
*  these negotiations, but it was just Friday. Mr. President Trump tweeted, 80 percent tariff [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=370.38s)]
*  on China seems right up to Scott B., of course, meaning you, as you went into those negotiations. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=376.38s)]
*  You ended up at a number quite a bit lower than that. Talk to us about the tenor of these [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=382.38s)]
*  talks and how you reached the number where you ended up. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=386.38s)]
*  Well, the tenor of the talks is very much similar to the relationship at the top of [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=392.38s)]
*  the two countries. President Trump has great respect for Party Chair Xi, and it is vice [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=399.38s)]
*  versa. They have spoken often, and in fact, President Trump reached a fantastic trade [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=406.38s)]
*  deal in January 2020 under Party Chair Xi's leadership that was discarded from the United [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=412.38s)]
*  States. It was discarded by the Biden administration, and we are trying to get back to that. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=422.38s)]
*  The vice premier, who was my Chinese counterpart, came. The talks were firm and highly engaged. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=428.38s)]
*  Our teams spent a lot of time together, and what I would say was very different here, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=438.38s)]
*  too. I think for the first time, the Chinese understand the importance that President Trump [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=445.38s)]
*  puts on curing this fentanyl crisis in the U.S. and the role that China may be playing [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=452.38s)]
*  on that with precursor chemicals. They sent a vice minister for state security who specializes [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=458.38s)]
*  in narcotics, and he met with a member of our national security staff off to the side. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=468.38s)]
*  So this was while my team and I were focused on economics, there was a separate meeting on [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=476.38s)]
*  fentanyl, and I think this is the first time we are seeing progress on these precursor drugs [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=482.38s)]
*  that are coming into North America. All right, Treasury Secretary Scott Besant, thank you so [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=489.38s)]
*  much for being with us on the heels of a successful trade negotiation weekend. We greatly [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=495.38s)]
*  appreciate it. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=501.38s)]
*  Good, thank you. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=504.38s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Wb0iH8R6w&t=525.38s)]
