# Trump's 'big, beautiful bill' lobbying campaign fails to move GOP holdouts: Hill reporter
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY)
*  Right now, a live look at the House Rules Committee as lawmakers mark up the sprawling [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=0.0s)]
*  Republican spending package. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  Let's bring in congressional reporter for The Hill, Michael Schnell. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=7.84s)]
*  So Michael, what's happening right now? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=12.72s)]
*  Yeah, hey, Mika. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=14.52s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  The House Rules Committee just entered its sixth hour of debating what's called the big, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  beautiful bill. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=22.04s)]
*  It's, of course, the Republicans' bill full of a number of President Trump's legislative [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=23.04s)]
*  priorities. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=27.92s)]
*  We're still debating the nitty-gritty Democrats pressing Republicans on the specifics in this [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=28.96s)]
*  legislation, mostly about those Medicaid cuts and other spending cuts elsewhere. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=33.88s)]
*  And the big question is, when will the House be able to actually hold a vote on this bill? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=39.32s)]
*  Speaker Mike Johnson has made it very clear that he wants to pass this bill out of the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=45.56s)]
*  House by the week's end, maybe even holding a vote today or tomorrow. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  But the big thing we're waiting for right now is what's called the Manager's Amendment. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=54.620000000000005s)]
*  This is essentially going to be part of the legislation that's going to impact, that's [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=58.2s)]
*  going to make changes to the underlying bill that we've been talking about really for days [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=63.24s)]
*  and weeks now. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  Speaker Mike Johnson has been negotiating a variety of changes behind closed doors to [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=69.12s)]
*  try to appease hardline conservatives and moderate Republicans who have expressed doubts [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=73.92s)]
*  and opposition to the legislation. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=78.52000000000001s)]
*  So once we get to see the Manager's Amendment, we can actually parse through what changes [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=80.88s)]
*  are going to be made, what's going to be in this bill, and we'll be one step closer to having [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=84.92s)]
*  this vote. But there were some folks who said we may have gotten the Manager's Amendment last [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=89.36s)]
*  night before the Rules Committee had convened, maybe in the beginning of the hearing. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=93.08s)]
*  But like I said, we're still six hours in and we don't fully know what changes are going to be [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=97.16s)]
*  made on this bill, which is stalling when a vote could happen. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  So let me ask you again, your best guess right now based on your reporting, how many holdouts [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  are left? I mean, we sort of have conflicting reports. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=111.08s)]
*  Some say the president went to the Hill, he made the sell, the big, beautiful bill is going to pass. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=113.88s)]
*  Others say he went to the House and they're still short. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=118.56s)]
*  What's your reporting tell you? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=122.96s)]
*  There's enough. Look, when this comes to the floor, there's enough. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=125.52s)]
*  Speaker Mike Johnson can only afford to lose three Republican votes and still get this over the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=128.76s)]
*  finish line because of the margins. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=133.12s)]
*  There are far more than three holdouts right now. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=134.72s)]
*  I will note he did have a breakthrough late last night. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=137.72s)]
*  Speaker Johnson sources told me and my colleague at the Hill that they reached an agreement with [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=141.16s)]
*  moderate Republicans from high tax blue states on the state and local tax deduction cap, which had [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=146.6s)]
*  been one of the main sticking points hampering progress on this bill. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=152.72s)]
*  The only problem with that is that he may have a deal with the salt Republicans, but now Speaker [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=156.32s)]
*  Johnson has to sell that deal to the other parts of the conference, mainly members of the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=161.12s)]
*  House Freedom Caucus. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=166.72s)]
*  We've said that they really are not in the mood to accept a higher salt deduction cap. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=168.0s)]
*  Beyond the issue of salt, there are still a lot of disagreements that have to be worked out with [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=172.88s)]
*  potential Medicaid cuts. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=177.04s)]
*  We have hardline conservatives who are pushing for more significant changes to the social safety [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=178.32s)]
*  net program. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=182.8s)]
*  And then there's a discussion about rolling back major green energy provisions in the Inflation [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=183.6s)]
*  Reduction Act, which was, of course, the landmark piece of legislation that Democrats approved back [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=188.72s)]
*  in twenty twenty two. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=193.2s)]
*  So to get back to your question, Joe, there is enough right now to sink this thing. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=194.16s)]
*  But again, their negotiations have been ongoing behind the scenes constantly. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=198.48s)]
*  And Speaker Johnson still plowing ahead with his plan to hold a bill. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=202.88s)]
*  I'll vote this week. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=206.32s)]
*  Michael, you've got a couple of pieces of interesting reporting from what happened yesterday. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  One is that there might be a plan to try and discredit the CBO score. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=211.76s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=214.8s)]
*  Talk a little bit about that. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=215.2s)]
*  But you've also got reporting that that meeting that Donald Trump held, President Trump held with [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  House Republicans was actually much more fiery than the president came out saying it was. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=220.56s)]
*  Yes. So President Trump was sort of brought into the House GOP conference meeting yesterday, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=225.76s)]
*  which we'll all note is their weekly meeting to discuss various happenings on Capitol Hill [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=230.0s)]
*  to be the closer. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=234.16s)]
*  He has shown time and time again that when Republicans backs up against the wall, he's [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=235.28s)]
*  able to convince them to swallow whatever piece of legislation is before them, even if they have [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=239.6s)]
*  trashed it beforehand so they can get ahead with their priorities. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  So President Trump went in that room yesterday in the basement of the Capitol and then lawmakers [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=247.84s)]
*  came out afterwards and weren't exactly convinced. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=252.72s)]
*  There were still a number of those moderate Republicans pushing for an increase to the salt [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=255.28s)]
*  deduction cap, who said, even though President Trump said drop the salt thing, take the deal on [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=259.36s)]
*  the table, let's move on, they still pushed for a higher cap. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=263.76s)]
*  And then you have these hard-line conservatives, members of the Freedom Caucus, who are still [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=266.96s)]
*  pushing for more Medicaid cuts. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=270.96s)]
*  And there's that line that came out from the meeting yesterday. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=272.32s)]
*  President Trump told Republicans, don't F around with Medicaid, using the expletive in the room, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=275.36s)]
*  making it clear how he was feeling. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=282.40000000000003s)]
*  But we still have these hard-line Republicans who are pushing for these changes to the social [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=284.0s)]
*  safety net program. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=287.92s)]
*  So his lobbying campaign didn't exactly work the way Speaker Johnson had hoped it would. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=289.12s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=294.32s)]
*  Congressional reporter for The Hill, Michael Schnell. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=296.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=299.28000000000003s)]
*  Her latest reporting available to read online now. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=300.40000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmm9bQFyBY&t=305.36s)]
