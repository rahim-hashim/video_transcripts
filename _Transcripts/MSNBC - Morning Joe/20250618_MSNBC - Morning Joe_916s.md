# 'Really scary': Tom Friedman alarmed by WH 'cabinet of knuckleheads' as Israel-Iran conflict rises
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw)
*  Right now, foreign affairs columnist for The New York Times, Tom Friedman. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=0.0s)]
*  Tom's book, From Beirut to Jerusalem, is on sale now. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=3.04s)]
*  And his recent piece for The New York Times, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=5.92s)]
*  titled The Smart Way for Trump to End the Israel-Iran War. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=8.08s)]
*  Tom, not a lot of easy choices here in front of the president this morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=12.88s)]
*  The possibility to disarm Iran and to stop them from developing nuclear weapons. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=18.32s)]
*  On the other side of that ledger, of course, all we have to do is look back to the consequences [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=27.52s)]
*  of the Iraq invasion 22 years ago. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=32.4s)]
*  So what's the president's best step forward in your opinion? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=35.28s)]
*  Well, Joe, since this started, I've been advocating coercive diplomacy. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=40.08s)]
*  The Israelis have provided the coercion very effectively. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=44.64s)]
*  They've done enormous damage to Iran's military capacities, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  its missiles, and its nuclear supply chain. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=54.08s)]
*  I think now would be a good time for the diplomacy side. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=58.4s)]
*  Basically, for Trump to send Witkoff back, to say, we made you an offer before, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  we're going to make you an offer one last time. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=69.84s)]
*  You see what Israel's capable of. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=72.16s)]
*  You see where you are. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=73.68s)]
*  You see where we're capable of. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=75.2s)]
*  I think now is the time to make that offer. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=76.88s)]
*  Joe, back in 1991, I'm an old guy. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=95.36s)]
*  I was with Jim Baker when he met with Tariq Aziz in Geneva on the eve of Gulf War I [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=99.68s)]
*  and made a very similar offer. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=105.68s)]
*  The world saw that. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=108.16000000000001s)]
*  It gave America enormous legitimacy. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=109.68s)]
*  Then when Tariq Aziz, regrettably, as Baker said, turned us down, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=112.64s)]
*  gave the United States the ability to put a whole global coalition together against Iraq. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=117.52000000000001s)]
*  And I would be sending our secretary of state, or whoever is secretary of state in this [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=121.92000000000002s)]
*  administration, I have no clue anymore who does the negotiating, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=126.08000000000001s)]
*  to be making the same kind of offer to the Iranians right now. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=129.52s)]
*  So, Tom, given all that has happened in the last five or six days, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=133.44s)]
*  and given all that might happen in the next three or four days, apparently, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=136.8s)]
*  with bunker buster bombs and talk and everything like that, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=140.64s)]
*  this increasingly volatile region of the world, what is going on in Riyadh and Dubai? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=144.96s)]
*  What is going on there? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=151.84s)]
*  Well, Mike, actually, let me talk about both Riyadh and Dubai, and even more importantly, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=154.4s)]
*  in Beirut, Damascus, and Baghdad. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=159.76s)]
*  We tend to look at this conflict as simply between Iran and Israel. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=162.32000000000002s)]
*  In fact, the people rooting for this Iranian regime to be defanged are not just Israelis. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=166.8s)]
*  They're Lebanese, they're Syrians, they're Iraqis, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=174.32000000000002s)]
*  who have lived under the boot of Iranian colonialism since 1979. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=177.76000000000002s)]
*  Iran's business model in the Middle East was to hire Arab Shiites to kill Arab Sunnis [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=182.8s)]
*  in Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq, and through that, keep these countries permanently on a boil, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=187.84s)]
*  unable to basically coalesce any kind of democratic alternative. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=193.44s)]
*  Iran provided the foot soldiers through his bala for Bashar Assad in Syria [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=197.2s)]
*  to murder thousands of his people in order to stay in power. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=201.68s)]
*  So you have a whole Arab audience, forget the Gulfis, who are quietly, I can tell you, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=205.28s)]
*  rooting for Israel to take out the Iranian threat. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=210.8s)]
*  They have benefited already enormously from the weaken of Iran. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=214.24s)]
*  Lebanon now has a really good prime minister, a really good president. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=218.16s)]
*  Syria has a democratic option, and Iraq actually is feeling a lot easier, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=221.84s)]
*  also has its own frail democracy. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=227.28s)]
*  So nothing would be more welcome in these countries, let alone in Israel, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=229.51999999999998s)]
*  than to see the end of Iranian imperialism. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=235.28s)]
*  This is a bad regime, and it's been bad for Arabs every bit as much as Jews. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=237.28s)]
*  So Tom, let's get your take on a topic of conversation we had a short time ago. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=241.83999999999997s)]
*  Let's say the U.S. does go through this. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=246.56s)]
*  President Trump gives the go-ahead, and these bunker buster bombs are used, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=249.11999999999998s)]
*  and this devastation that falls for Iran. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=252.79999999999998s)]
*  What comes the day after? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=255.83999999999997s)]
*  What comes the day after in Iran, particularly for the United States, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=257.91999999999996s)]
*  and the Colin Powell maxim of if you break it, you buy it? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=264.32s)]
*  What does it look like next? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=268.32s)]
*  Just for the record, I wrote a column February 12, 2001, 2003, called You Break It, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=270.32s)]
*  You Own It, The Pottery Store Rule. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=276.72s)]
*  That started with me before the Iraq War. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=278.16s)]
*  You get credit then. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=279.76s)]
*  Look, I think we can't predict, but I do believe that, first of all, what worries me [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=283.68s)]
*  is that the Iranian leader is completely disconnected. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=289.68s)]
*  How much information can he be getting? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=293.76s)]
*  He's sitting in a bunker somewhere hiding. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=295.44s)]
*  His entire top military and military intelligence leadership has been wiped out. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=297.52s)]
*  Who knows how much he even understands about what's going on? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=303.59999999999997s)]
*  That said, somebody there does. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=307.35999999999996s)]
*  I do believe that if we made one last attempt at coercive diplomacy—and again, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=309.44s)]
*  I would be demanding the end of their nuclear program—who knows what they would answer? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=316.56s)]
*  On one hand, you have to say, Karim Sajedpour, the Iranian expert at Carnegie, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=323.91999999999996s)]
*  likes to say the Iranians are homicidal but not suicidal. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=328.79999999999995s)]
*  I think if we did go to war with them or take out this nuclear facility, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=333.68s)]
*  they'd have a big decision whether they attack our forces, because that would truly mean [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=338.24s)]
*  the end of their regime. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=343.28s)]
*  That's on day one, or that's the morning after. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=345.67999999999995s)]
*  What I'm always looking at in the Middle East, Jonathan, is the morning after the morning after. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=347.76s)]
*  That's when things get really interesting, and interesting not always in a pleasant way. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=352.4s)]
*  Does Iran begin—the regime begin to crumble? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=358.0s)]
*  We're talking about a country of 95 million people. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=360.56s)]
*  What kind of disorder flows from there? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=363.28s)]
*  Do you get a crazy general there who decides to sink some tankers in the straits of Hormuz? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=365.44s)]
*  It's just totally unpredictable, and I wouldn't even attempt to try to say what could happen. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=372.4s)]
*  Right now, I'm focused on this idea. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=377.35999999999996s)]
*  We've developed the coercion very effectively. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=379.6s)]
*  Let's give one more shot at diplomacy. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=382.8s)]
*  So, Tom, let me ask you a couple of questions. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=386.16s)]
*  Again, no easy answers here, but it's very easy for us to sketch out, because it's so probable, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=389.76s)]
*  the chaos that would flow from the toppling of the regime in Iran. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=397.6s)]
*  It is a frightening specter. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=402.08s)]
*  We've seen it time and time again, even over the past 20, 25 years. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=403.76s)]
*  On the other side of that ledger, though, is, again, something I said earlier that [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=408.96s)]
*  an old Southern member of the Armed Services Committee told me one time, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=413.68s)]
*  if you attack the snake, you better kill the snake. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=417.68s)]
*  If Israel, if the United States does not follow through with the destruction of their nuclear [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=421.92s)]
*  program, wouldn't Iran be motivated to move more quickly toward putting that nuclear program back [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=428.96s)]
*  together and building a bomb and using it against us? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=437.36s)]
*  I'm not sure they would use it against us, but certainly they could use it against Israel. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=441.52000000000004s)]
*  Or Israel. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=445.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=446.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=447.2s)]
*  Joe, this is a hellish problem. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=448.16s)]
*  It's a hellish choice. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=449.6s)]
*  It always has been. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=450.48s)]
*  And that's why I favor a kind of step-by-step methodical approach to it. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=453.04s)]
*  I want the whole world to see that what Iran has, every effort we made to avoid war, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=458.64s)]
*  because if there is a war, Joe, it's going to be a long war, and you want maximum legitimacy. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=465.28000000000003s)]
*  You want the world behind us. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=469.92s)]
*  That also creates leverage. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=471.44000000000005s)]
*  And so how you get into this war, I think, really matters. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=472.96000000000004s)]
*  I would say another thing, Joe. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=476.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is now paying for the fact that he appointed a cabinet of knuckleheads. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=477.68s)]
*  He's got a defense minister who is a former Sunday weekend host on Fox. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=482.72s)]
*  His DNI, he's repudiated because she's another knucklehead. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=487.76000000000005s)]
*  You hire clowns, you get a circus. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=492.0s)]
*  And who is in the room there giving him advice right now? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=494.4s)]
*  That is really scary. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=498.32s)]
*  And this is why when you hire people just for their slavish loyalty to you, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=499.52s)]
*  not for their expertise and willingness to say no to you and to question you, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=503.36s)]
*  that is really scary to me. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=508.24s)]
*  And he's paying the price for that right now. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=509.92s)]
*  And the next thing to bring up, and again, you've obviously been through the first goal [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=513.2s)]
*  for reporting on it from deep inside the administration and across the Middle East, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=520.64s)]
*  a second goal for I know you remember George W. Bush's Axis of Evil speech. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=525.36s)]
*  It always struck many as tragically ironic that in the Axis of Evil, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=532.64s)]
*  George W. Bush decided to go to war with the one member of that Axis. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=542.4s)]
*  That was the furthest away from developing nuclear weapons, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=549.76s)]
*  developing weapons of mass destruction. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=553.92s)]
*  And I remember reading a column years ago where you had talked to somebody in Tehran who said, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=556.96s)]
*  why didn't you guys come here? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=565.6s)]
*  We're the ones who needed regime change most of all. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=568.88s)]
*  This is the best opportunity to change out this regime that has been the epicenter [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=572.24s)]
*  of global terrorism since 1979. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=579.52s)]
*  Again, it just seems this is an existential bet either way the president goes with it. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=582.64s)]
*  Talk about what the world looks like though with the threat of a nuclear Iran removed. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=591.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think, Joe, I'm among that group that believes that this is a—it's not an exact analogy, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=600.48s)]
*  but it's a Berlin Wall kind of moment in that this Iranian regime is a really bad actor, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=608.0s)]
*  not just regionally, most of all, of course, for its own people. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=616.64s)]
*  We're talking about a country that is an incredible civilization, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=619.2s)]
*  going back thousands of years. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=623.52s)]
*  The potential of the Persian nation to contribute to the region and to the world is enormous. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=625.28s)]
*  That has been completely stifled by this regime. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=632.8s)]
*  I mean, and it's a tragedy for these people, but this regime has also stifled the opportunities [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=637.04s)]
*  of Lebanon, of Syria, of Iraq. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=643.52s)]
*  It is no accident, Joe, that people have pointed out the president of Syria today, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=646.0s)]
*  Syria is like one country that hasn't even given the titular, oh, you shouldn't do this, America. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=650.3199999999999s)]
*  There are just a lot of Arabs really rooting for this bad regime to leave. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=655.92s)]
*  That's on the upside. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=660.16s)]
*  On the downside is a vast country, and instability from there can really spill all over, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=661.2s)]
*  and the transition will not be overnight. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=667.12s)]
*  We're not going to go from this regime to a wonderful leader. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=668.88s)]
*  And therefore, I say what I say in Iraq and today, if you're going to do this, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=672.32s)]
*  this is a long road. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=677.52s)]
*  You want maximum legitimacy to do this, and the maximum legitimacy is produced by going about this [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=679.12s)]
*  in a very systematic way. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=686.0s)]
*  Israel has generated enormous coercive power on the Iranians. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=687.84s)]
*  Whatever they're saying, they are really hurting, and the Israelis aren't done. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=691.84s)]
*  Let's leverage that so the whole world sees. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=696.16s)]
*  For one last time, we're going to go to this regime and say, you need to end this program [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=698.72s)]
*  in a verifiable way right now. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=703.04s)]
*  And if you don't, that coercion is going to go to its final conclusion. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=706.16s)]
*  Let the whole world see that we are avoiding war every way we possibly can, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=711.12s)]
*  but the world will not be a stable place if this regime is allowed to pursue this nuclear program, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=715.52s)]
*  which is clearly not about generating electricity. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=721.52s)]
*  So, Tom, you've mentioned the danger of the lack of counsel around President Trump. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=724.8s)]
*  What happens if this war phases out, if we participate in the bombing and we think, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=733.12s)]
*  okay, we've done our job, what's your sense of our ability to defend ourselves against the very, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=740.1600000000001s)]
*  very excellent cyber attack people who come out of Iran? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=747.2s)]
*  They really know cyber. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=751.36s)]
*  They know cyber warfare. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=752.64s)]
*  Honestly, Mike, I think if the war were to go ahead, Iran would be in disarray after this. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=756.08s)]
*  If the war is going ahead, if we blow up all its nuclear facilities, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=763.44s)]
*  they've been decapitated militarily. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=768.3199999999999s)]
*  I think the biggest fear I had, what do we learn from all these Middle East wars, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=771.12s)]
*  from the decapitation of Gaddafi, for instance, to the decapitation of Saddam Hussein, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=775.28s)]
*  that in the Middle East, the alternative to autocracy is not democracy. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=780.3199999999999s)]
*  It's very often disorder. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=785.04s)]
*  We'd like to think we get rid of a bad regime and a good one comes. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=787.4399999999999s)]
*  That's not necessarily what happens here. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=790.0s)]
*  We'd be very lucky if that happens. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=792.0799999999999s)]
*  It's the spread of disorder and trying to manage disorder spilling out from a giant country like [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=794.24s)]
*  Iran, which I think would be the biggest diplomatic and security challenge from this, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=800.72s)]
*  and trying to keep this place together. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=805.36s)]
*  It may be inevitable. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=808.32s)]
*  It may be the necessary condition. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=809.2s)]
*  But what was we worried about with the collapse of the Soviet Union? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=811.12s)]
*  You know, what was spreading disorder? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=814.48s)]
*  We got lucky because there was a Gorbachev. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=816.72s)]
*  Could we get lucky and there emerge an Iranian Gorbachev? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=818.88s)]
*  We might, absolutely. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=821.84s)]
*  All I'm saying is let's go out about this in the most methodical way, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=823.28s)]
*  because we're going to need the maximum help, the maximum legitimacy [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=827.36s)]
*  to manage what would be a giant mess after this. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=831.52s)]
*  You know, it's such an extraordinarily important point. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=835.68s)]
*  We always talk about what happens the day after a war, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=838.56s)]
*  or as Tom says, the day after the day after a war ends. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=842.16s)]
*  Tom's point here is so important. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=846.56s)]
*  We need to be concerned here about what happens [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=849.12s)]
*  the days to the weeks before the war and building the legitimacy that's needed worldwide globally, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=852.0s)]
*  because this is not going to be a one and done operation. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=859.5200000000001s)]
*  This is going to require buy-in from our allies, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=862.8800000000001s)]
*  and even those who don't consider themselves to be natural allies of the United States or Israel. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=866.4000000000001s)]
*  New York Times columnist Tom Friedman, thank you very much. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=871.44s)]
*  Thank you, Tom. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=875.0400000000001s)]
*  Go ahead, Tom. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=875.6s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=876.24s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=876.8000000000001s)]
*  I want to say that my point in my column yesterday is that we need to pair two things. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=877.6s)]
*  One is coercive diplomacy in the Middle East, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=881.7600000000001s)]
*  and the other is support for a Palestinian-Israeli peace process in Gaza, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=883.84s)]
*  because that's not over either, let's remember. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=889.0400000000001s)]
*  And that also enhances our legitimacy if we're seen as pursuing both at the same time. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=891.2800000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVz-LOtjAjw&t=911.44s)]
