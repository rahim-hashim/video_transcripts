# 'Terrible predicament': Iran doesn't have great near-term options for retaliation, says expert
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY)
*  David, let me read from your column that you posted yesterday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=0.0s)]
*  As the Iran crisis deepened over the past week, Russia and China could not play a decisive [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=6.28s)]
*  role. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=11.96s)]
*  It failed to President Trump, and he acted. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=13.02s)]
*  That will be noted in Beijing and Moscow, and also among allies who worry about the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=16.14s)]
*  U.S. staying power. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=22.16s)]
*  Talk about the importance of this strike, not just in what it may have done in degrading [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=24.74s)]
*  the weapons system there, but also to answer some of those concerns that so many U.S. foreign [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=32.46s)]
*  policymakers and allies across the world had about this administration, and whether they [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=39.06s)]
*  would stand up if something happened to Taiwan or if something happened to other allies across [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=45.78s)]
*  the Middle East. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=51.84s)]
*  Joe, not to be too cold-blooded about it, but a year or two ago you would have said [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=54.34s)]
*  that actors in the world are not deterred by the threat that the U.S. will use force. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=61.34s)]
*  Russia invades Ukraine despite repeated warnings from the United States. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=69.24000000000001s)]
*  Russia despite suffering big losses there doesn't back off. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=74.30000000000001s)]
*  Russia mounts a range of attacks against NATO forces in Europe covertly for the most [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=78.18s)]
*  part. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=85.98s)]
*  Iran threatens to assassinate people in the United States with little apparent U.S. response. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=86.98s)]
*  There have been a series of signs that people don't take the threat of U.S. retaliation [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=92.98s)]
*  seriously. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=99.30000000000001s)]
*  Without over-crediting President Trump, by acting decisively in sending these powerful, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=100.98s)]
*  powerful munitions in a very well-organized strike, he reminded the world that the United [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=109.98s)]
*  States is very powerful and is prepared to use that military force. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=114.67999999999999s)]
*  And if you're an ally of the United States, I listed some, if you're the Japanese in [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=118.88s)]
*  Tokyo, entirely dependent on U.S. power. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=123.06s)]
*  If you're the Emiratis in Abu Dhabi who want to make a bet on the U.S. but are sure tempted [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=126.46s)]
*  by China, or if you're the Taiwanese in Taipei, you think gee, the United States is a little [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=130.85999999999999s)]
*  tougher and more willing to use its enormous power than I might have thought a year ago. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=137.01999999999998s)]
*  So Kareem, let's go to you now and your assessment of this action. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=143.54s)]
*  Donald Trump, the president, America's first president who said he didn't want to be the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=147.54s)]
*  one to engage in a new foreign conflict, that he's the commander-in-chief after decades. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=151.98s)]
*  He's the one who didn't decide to make the decision to bomb these sites in Iran. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=156.82s)]
*  Talk to us about that and also what you see could Iran's response be, a power that has [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=162.17999999999998s)]
*  been consistently weakened and degradated since October 7th with its proxies badly wounded, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=167.85999999999999s)]
*  the regime really punished in the last week or so to the point where the supreme leader [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=176.22s)]
*  has only so many options right now. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=182.74s)]
*  Well, it is a remarkable transformation for President Trump. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=185.74s)]
*  It was just last month in Riyadh that he gave a speech in which he ridiculed those who have [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=190.5s)]
*  engaged in nation building, saying they destroyed more nations than they built, and interventionists [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=197.45999999999998s)]
*  who had no idea about the realities of the societies in which they were intervening. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=203.98s)]
*  So had we been having this conversation two years ago, I would have said that President [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=208.38s)]
*  Trump's end goal is to reach a deal with Iran. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=213.29999999999998s)]
*  He actually wanted a Nixon to China moment with Iran, but I think it was a combination [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=215.2s)]
*  of Benjamin Netanyahu's insistence and Ayatollah Khamenei's defiance which led to this transformation. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=220.26s)]
*  And now Iran's supreme leader, 86 years old, is in the most precarious position of his [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=227.33999999999997s)]
*  life. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=233.94s)]
*  He's under a bunker right now. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=234.94s)]
*  Many of his top military commanders have been assassinated, and he's in this terrible predicament [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=237.46s)]
*  in which if he does not respond strongly, he loses face. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=242.74s)]
*  But if he responds too strongly, he could lose his head. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=247.94s)]
*  He could lose his life. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=251.22s)]
*  He could lose his regime. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=252.22s)]
*  And in my view, Iran doesn't have great near-term options for retaliation, but I want to emphasize [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=253.86s)]
*  what David just said. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=260.18s)]
*  In the medium term, what I think we should be very concerned about now is what happened [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=261.98s)]
*  with this nuclear fuel. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=266.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=268.38s)]
*  And I agree. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=270.42s)]
*  Iran doesn't have a lot of good options right now. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=273.1s)]
*  Khaddi, this is a regime that is just struggling to survive, to keep the Ayatollah alive right [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=275.82s)]
*  now. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=283.06s)]
*  Their military hierarchy has been gutted at the top. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=284.06s)]
*  Their nuclear scientists killed. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=289.82s)]
*  Politicians, those closest to the Ayatollah, also killed. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=292.34s)]
*  I mean, it has been a savage 10 days for the Iranians, so their options seem limited at [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=297.34s)]
*  best. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=304.78s)]
*  I do want to really quickly touch on, though, the efforts of diplomacy. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=305.78s)]
*  They were given 60 days, and you get a feeling that they thought Donald Trump was bluffing. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=310.78s)]
*  They feel like American presidents are always bluffing. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=317.3s)]
*  They were given 60 days, and about 58, 59 days into that, Donald Trump talked to the [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=320.94s)]
*  Israelis, Netanyahu, and said they may not make the deadline. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=328.22s)]
*  And so the strikes began. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=333.5s)]
*  But then even this past week, word out of the White House was that Donald Trump would [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=336.1s)]
*  Turkey and meet with the Iranians if they were willing to do that, and they still were [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=343.94s)]
*  not willing to strike a deal. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=349.98s)]
*  Yeah, so the diplomatic route ran out for the White House. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=352.86s)]
*  The military route became the possibility that previous presidents have ignored for [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=356.94s)]
*  the reasons that David and Kareem have just laid out. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=360.58s)]
*  We don't exactly know where this ends. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=363.3s)]
*  I was told over the weekend by a senior American general that there are two myths of war. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=364.98s)]
*  One is that wars can be short, and the other is that war can be fought from a distance. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4G5E-mLzY&t=368.9s)]
