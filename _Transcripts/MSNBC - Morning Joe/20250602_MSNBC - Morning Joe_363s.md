# ‘He’s not fiscally conservative’: Joe rebukes Speaker Johnson’s claims about megabill
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk)
*  I am a fiscal hawk. Many of my Republican colleagues in the House feel the same way. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=0.0s)]
*  But it did not—we didn't get in this situation overnight, Kristen. It took us decades, many [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=7.04s)]
*  decades of Congress's frankly mismanagement of the public fisc to get in this situation. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=11.48s)]
*  And the last four years of the Biden administration increased spending dramatically. So it's going [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=16.86s)]
*  to take us a while to get out of it. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=20.88s)]
*  You know, he says you can look at the Bible and figure out what type of speaker he is. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=22.6s)]
*  But I just want to give the speaker the benefit of the doubt here. Maybe he just doesn't know [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=29.58s)]
*  history. In fact, maybe he doesn't even know current events. Because if he did, he would [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=36.5s)]
*  know that actually 20 years ago or so, a Congress balanced the budget four years in a row, and [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=41.46s)]
*  over the past eight years, the Trump administration, the first time, passed the largest deficits, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=48.86s)]
*  the biggest debt, the biggest budgets in history up to that point, Donald Trump's [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=57.42s)]
*  administration and the Republicans in the House of Representatives. And maybe, I don't [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=64.22s)]
*  know, maybe Mike Johnson wasn't paying attention back then. But they increased the national [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=69.74000000000001s)]
*  debt more in four years than every other Congress and every other president had in the history [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=74.62s)]
*  cumulatively. And now, and I'm sorry to start the show this way, I just have to. When somebody [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=82.42s)]
*  says something that is so misleading, so misleading, when somebody says something that's so misleading, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=89.42s)]
*  it's very, very important that people know that this budget that Mike Johnson is trying [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=102.94s)]
*  desperately to pass will help increase the federal debt by $20 trillion over the next [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=109.94s)]
*  10 years. Let me just say that again. Mike Johnson is desperately working to pass a budget [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=118.58s)]
*  that will increase the national debt by $20 trillion over the next 10 years. Do you realize [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=126.06s)]
*  this country didn't even accumulate that much debt over its first 220 years of existence? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=135.68s)]
*  Combined together from George Washington through Barack Obama. Think about this. From George [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=144.12s)]
*  Washington's term, beginning of George Washington's term, through the end of Barack Obama's term, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=153.60000000000002s)]
*  on January 20th, 2016, 2017, the United States of America did not increase the national debt [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=162.16s)]
*  by as much as Mike Johnson's budget will increase the national debt over the next decade. And [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=174.18s)]
*  he says he's fiscally conservative? No, he's not. He's not at all. And again, how any Republican [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=182.44s)]
*  could ever claim to be conservative and vote for a budget that adds $20 trillion to a $37 [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=190.20000000000002s)]
*  trillion debt and wrecks our economy is just beyond me. Well, despite that, the Speaker [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=197.44s)]
*  of the House on Meet the Press continued to dismiss projections. The sweeping domestic [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=202.94s)]
*  policy bill, narrowly passed by House Republicans, would add trillions to the national debt. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  So it comes as senators return to Capitol Hill today with that legislation at the top [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=213.72s)]
*  of their agenda. We'll go through the changes they're looking to make. Plus, Republican [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=218.54000000000002s)]
*  Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa doubling down on comments about possible cuts to Medicaid that [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=222.58s)]
*  angered her constituents at a town hall. What we're going to be looking at, we're going [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=230.26000000000002s)]
*  to be looking at in the midterm elections, the richest man in the world wielding a chainsaw, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=234.98000000000002s)]
*  bragging about cutting veterans' benefits, bragging about cuts to farmers' benefits, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=243.04s)]
*  bragging about cuts to rural hospitals, you name it, all of the cuts, they're going to [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=251.04s)]
*  be looking at that. And then when Joni Ernst is asked what she's going to do about the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=259.03999999999996s)]
*  fact that maybe 40% of children in the state of Iowa, her state, are going to be impacted [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=262.24s)]
*  by Medicaid cuts, and about 50% of seniors that are in nursing homes in her state are [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=268.12s)]
*  going to be impacted by these cuts. Her response is, well, we're all going to die anyway. And [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=275.26s)]
*  then she makes a joke about it in the graveyard. This is, I'm sure, Webster's dictionary wants [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=281.1s)]
*  to kind of use video in the future. Put that next to clueless, because that's what these [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=288.18s)]
*  Republicans are right now. They're clueless. They're savaging healthcare in their own districts, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=294.1s)]
*  in their own states. And Joni Ernst feels confident enough not only to say, well, you're [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=300.1s)]
*  going to die anyway, then she feels confident enough that she can do whatever she wants [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=304.84000000000003s)]
*  to do, go into a graveyard, and make jokes about how everybody's going to die anyway. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=310.02000000000004s)]
*  Think about how she bursts onto the scene. She was going to be the person that was going [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=315.82000000000005s)]
*  to go after pork barrel spending and all the squealing and all that other stuff. And [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=319.72s)]
*  so that's how she starts. And this is where she comes to, which is again making jokes [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=324.48s)]
*  about senior citizens who are going to have their healthcare gutted, about children in [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=334.22s)]
*  her state going to have their healthcare gutted, and her response is, we can all die anyway. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAWxG3xcWTk&t=338.84000000000003s)]
