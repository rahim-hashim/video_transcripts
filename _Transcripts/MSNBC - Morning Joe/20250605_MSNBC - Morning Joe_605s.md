# 'Is it fixed now? No': Air-traffic controller says Newark taking safety steps but not there yet
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64)
*  A beautiful day here in New York City, 734, our view from the top of our building looking [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=0.0s)]
*  south into Manhattan. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=6.2s)]
*  The FAA issued a ground stop on all flights at Newark Liberty International Airport last [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=7.48s)]
*  night, citing staffing shortage. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=13.08s)]
*  That order since has been lifted, but just the latest in a series of problems plaguing [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=15.4s)]
*  that travel hub. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=19.72s)]
*  Our next guest knows these issues all too well. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=20.86s)]
*  For example, May 4th detailed this incident in the Wall Street Journal. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=23.98s)]
*  Quote, Jonathan Stewart was into his fourth hour overseeing the planes flying near Newark, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=28.16s)]
*  New Jersey when he noticed two aircraft speeding nose to nose on his radar scope. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=33.16s)]
*  After recognizing the unfolding conflict, he instructed the pilots to turn the planes [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=38.04s)]
*  away from each other, which they did, but Stewart was badly shaken. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=42.28s)]
*  Quote, I don't want to be responsible for killing 400 people, he said. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=46.32s)]
*  The veteran air traffic controller joins us now. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=50.96s)]
*  John, it's great to have you with us here in the studio. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  It's unusual, we should say, for an air traffic controller, somebody with this much authority [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=56.32s)]
*  to come forward and speak publicly, but you felt the situation is dire enough that you [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=60.92s)]
*  need to come out into the media and speak about it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=66.0s)]
*  As you see it, from your experience vantage point, how bad are things right now? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=69.56s)]
*  Well, they're not good, I'll tell you that much. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  I'll say the same to you that I said to other outlets. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=77.24000000000001s)]
*  I've been advised that steps are being taken to mitigate risk to the max extent possible. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=80.6s)]
*  I.e. changing equipment, hiring more controllers, stuff like that. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=86.24s)]
*  The unfortunate thing is it's not a flipping of a switch. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=90.0s)]
*  We didn't get here overnight, we're not going to get recovered overnight either. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=94.52s)]
*  Again, this is my opinion from Jonathan Stewart, not the FAA, I'm not an FAA spokesperson, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=97.96s)]
*  they have their own team for that. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=102.28s)]
*  But that's how I see it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=103.8s)]
*  A lot of it, as you say, starts with staffing shortages. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=105.28s)]
*  How does that manifest itself? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=107.84s)]
*  Staffing is going to be an issue because if you don't have the number of people that you [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=110.36s)]
*  effectively, then that's a constraint. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=114.24s)]
*  If you need 14 people and you have three, you're going to be limited in how many sectors [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=117.6s)]
*  you're going to be able to open up. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=121.96s)]
*  Typically, if you have two sectors open, you have two controllers working and two would [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=123.64s)]
*  be on break. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=128.4s)]
*  When you start running into odd numbers like that, now you have air traffic controllers [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=129.88s)]
*  working longer in position, with still the same staffing issue as before. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=133.64s)]
*  It's a recipe for not good things. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=138.44s)]
*  When there's a ground stop like there was again last night in Newark, for example, and [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=140.68s)]
*  they say it's because of staffing shortages, what does it take for you all to say, we've [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=144.32s)]
*  got to stop planes coming in and out of here, it's that bad? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=148.36s)]
*  That would be above my pay grade. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=152.56s)]
*  I'm an operational supervisor, that would be an operational manager that would make [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=154.12s)]
*  that call, and it would depend on a lot of different things. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=157.8s)]
*  I'm not going to get into conjecture as to how they're going to make that call. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=162.0s)]
*  But they just don't feel like there are enough eyes on planes? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=165.4s)]
*  Yeah, basically, as I told Andrew, you can work about 17 or 18 airplanes at one time [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=168.35999999999999s)]
*  before you run out of the ability to speak to one and go all the way back and speak to [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=174.95999999999998s)]
*  the other one at 250 miles an hour. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=178.6s)]
*  It's basic math. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=181.07999999999998s)]
*  There's really not much about it. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  If I have 18 airplanes, I know I pretty much can't take another one. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=183.79999999999998s)]
*  A moment ago, you said we didn't get here overnight in terms of the problem. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=187.44s)]
*  Walk us through that evolution. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=191.28s)]
*  You've been on the job for a while. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=192.28s)]
*  How have you seen things, how do you think things get worse and how does that increase [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=193.56s)]
*  the pressure on people in your role? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=197.32s)]
*  OK, so the biggest issue for me was, and I believe for all the controllers involved in [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  it, was moving the area from New York and 90 down to Philly to begin with. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=203.48s)]
*  That was fraught with issues from the get-go. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=209.16s)]
*  Everyone knew about it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=211.6s)]
*  Everybody said that there were issues with it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=212.6s)]
*  There were several studies done, I guess SRM, something to that effect, to decide how much [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=214.44s)]
*  risk there was and whether or not it was acceptable level of risk. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=219.95999999999998s)]
*  It was deemed to be acceptable. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=223.48s)]
*  I wasn't involved in that. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=224.95999999999998s)]
*  All I do know is that from the beginning, as soon as the agency and NACA, to be fair, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=227.07999999999998s)]
*  both agreed that this was something they were going to do, everybody thought it was a bad [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=232.6s)]
*  idea with the exception of the people that were spearheading the project. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=236.12s)]
*  So you're there looking at screens filled with potential lethal consequences, planes [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=240.84s)]
*  flying all over. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=246.64s)]
*  Yeah, you need to be able to see them and talk to them. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=247.64s)]
*  You're either standing or sitting. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=249.6s)]
*  Sitting. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=251.2s)]
*  So what gets exhausted? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=252.2s)]
*  Your eyes, your mental awareness, how long are the breaks? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=254.36s)]
*  Are there any breaks that you have? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=258.8s)]
*  So as I stated before, the way I tried to run my operation as an operational supervisor [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=260.56s)]
*  was I would do an hour on and an hour off. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=264.56s)]
*  And that was based on the volume of traffic, the complexity, a lot of other things. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=266.96000000000004s)]
*  How tired is the controller? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=271.16s)]
*  How far along is his shift disease? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=272.24s)]
*  So on and so forth. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=273.56s)]
*  But yes, your eyes start to get tired. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=274.56s)]
*  I'm 45, not 25. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=276.56s)]
*  So yeah, your eyes start to get tired. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=278.36s)]
*  You start to truncate call signs and reverse call signs. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=280.64s)]
*  For example, Delta is D-A-L, United is U-A-L. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=284.16s)]
*  So that U starts to look like a D, that D starts to look like a U, that's one of the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=287.72s)]
*  signs that you're starting to get mental fatigue. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=290.48s)]
*  And that for me is a warning sign. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=293.56s)]
*  I'm like, okay, I need to get out of here. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=294.76000000000005s)]
*  I need a break. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=295.92s)]
*  And that's going to be different every single time you plug in, depending on how tired I [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=296.92s)]
*  am, what I have going on at home. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=301.68s)]
*  There's so many things involved in it. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=303.6s)]
*  So it's important that the supervisor that's in charge, operational supervisor, is cognizant [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=305.08000000000004s)]
*  of the ability and the mental acuity of the people that he's working with. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=310.68s)]
*  So if I know that so and so is having a bad day, he's tired, I'm probably not going to [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=316.44s)]
*  put him in a busy position. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=319.96s)]
*  The issue arises when you don't have anybody and now you have no choice. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=321.32s)]
*  So you want to do the right thing, but you can't because you have three people and you [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=325.42s)]
*  need 14. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=328.84000000000003s)]
*  So I mean, I don't even know what to say to that. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=330.04s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=332.08s)]
*  Joe? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=333.08s)]
*  So there's a shortage, obviously. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=334.08s)]
*  There's a shortage of air traffic controllers. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=336.04s)]
*  What about raising the age, the retirement age, up to 60, 61, 62? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=340.36s)]
*  Would that help? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=345.28000000000003s)]
*  I can't hear him. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=346.28000000000003s)]
*  He's asking about the retirement age. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=347.28000000000003s)]
*  Would it help to raise the retirement age up to 61 or 62 from where it is now? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=350.44s)]
*  So raising the retirement age would be a short-term fix. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=354.92s)]
*  But again, now you're running into having controllers that have been doing it for 25 [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=359.6s)]
*  or 30 years. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=363.12s)]
*  Now they're doing it longer. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=364.12s)]
*  The unfortunate reality is as you get older, your mental acuity starts to fade a little [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=365.6s)]
*  bit, right? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=370.72s)]
*  The only good thing is I was faster when I was 21, but now I have 25 years of experience. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=371.8s)]
*  So I'm a little slower, but I have more in my toolbox, so to speak. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=377.64000000000004s)]
*  So there is a little bit of give and take, a little bit of balance there. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=381.68s)]
*  I think it's a good idea, to be fair. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=385.64000000000004s)]
*  I think it is not the fix-all, though. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=388.64000000000004s)]
*  You have to hire people right now. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=390.76000000000005s)]
*  Speaking of retirement age, everybody knows that typically a controller retires at 56. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=395.72s)]
*  So it's assumed that it's going to take somewhere between one and three years, depending on [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=399.92s)]
*  the level of the facility, to get checked out to be a usable controller. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=403.0s)]
*  So not a math guy, but 56 minus three is 53. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=407.28000000000003s)]
*  So when the person that's supposed to retire at 56 or is within three years of being eligible [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=412.40000000000003s)]
*  to retire, basic life cycle planning would tell you, let's hire somebody. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=417.20000000000005s)]
*  And if you know that only half of the people make it, hire two people and then extrapolate. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=422.12s)]
*  So you're going to hire more people. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=427.16s)]
*  Is there a minor leagues for your traffic controllers? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=428.6s)]
*  Where do you get them? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=431.96000000000004s)]
*  Okay, so there's different levels of controllers, right? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=433.44s)]
*  So you have your busiest, which is the level 12, which is what Newark is, and then it goes [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=435.8s)]
*  all the way down to, I believe, a level four or five. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=440.12s)]
*  And that's just the complexity and volume of the traffic. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=442.92s)]
*  So yeah, a lot of guys that are working at level sevens and level eights would love to [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=448.12s)]
*  come up to level 12 because it pays more, right? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=451.1s)]
*  The issue is not everybody can do it in Newark. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=453.98s)]
*  Not everybody can do it at Kennedy. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=456.42s)]
*  Like the Northeast is a different animal in general. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=457.62s)]
*  So I told somebody else, if I could pick the perfect air traffic control candidate, it [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=461.42s)]
*  would be somebody that plays video games or like a line cook, somebody that's behind taking [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=466.46000000000004s)]
*  orders, processing them, yelling out stuff, stuff like that. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=470.82000000000005s)]
*  Like they think fast, they talk fast. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=473.5s)]
*  That's what you need. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=475.1s)]
*  What role did the pandemic and then the retirements that stemmed from the pandemic play in creating [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=476.3s)]
*  this current crisis? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=481.88s)]
*  Oh, I mean, it's all created, you know, made it way worse because during the pandemic, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=482.88s)]
*  we stopped training people that were eligible to retire, just retired because what are you [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=488.14000000000004s)]
*  going to do? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=492.42s)]
*  Like sit around and, I don't know, make half a paycheck. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=493.42s)]
*  The same thing happened with the airlines too, to be fair. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=495.72s)]
*  So you have a lack of experience on both sides of the microphone right now, which is a recipe [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=497.68s)]
*  for not good things. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=501.74s)]
*  We're just leaving it at that. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=502.74s)]
*  What about the technology, John? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=503.74s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=506.38s)]
*  So it seems like that should be a big priority in addition to hiring when you have the copper [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=507.38s)]
*  wires that burn and create the problem there. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=511.3s)]
*  You guys still sometimes using little pieces of paper to pack. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=514.2s)]
*  Yeah, those are called flight progress trips. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=516.62s)]
*  That's just an old school way of keeping track of it. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=519.02s)]
*  And to be fair, it's kind of ironic because the reason behind using flight progress trips [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=521.14s)]
*  to begin was in case you lost radar. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=526.86s)]
*  So you would have the call sign, you would have the altitude, like everything you said [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=529.5600000000001s)]
*  when you spoke, you wrote it down. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=532.22s)]
*  When I had my incidents, that's what I was doing, but I was doing it with a sheet of [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=534.46s)]
*  paper. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=536.98s)]
*  I was writing down the call sign, writing down the altitude, writing down the direction [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=537.98s)]
*  of flight. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=540.4s)]
*  So that way if I lost, or correction, when I lost radar and or radios, I could be reasonably [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=541.4s)]
*  assured that nobody was going to run into each other. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=546.5s)]
*  So bottom line here before I let you go. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=549.66s)]
*  Is it safe to fly in and out of Newark Airport right now? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=551.82s)]
*  Okay, so I think it's safe to fly. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=554.86s)]
*  The NAS is still the safest way to get around, period, right? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=557.58s)]
*  Newark Airport, I've been assured by people at the top that steps are being taken to fix it. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=560.98s)]
*  Is it fixed now? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=566.94s)]
*  No. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=567.94s)]
*  You know, I'll just leave that up to your imagination. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=568.94s)]
*  I'm not going to get into too much conjecture there. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=571.86s)]
*  But the point is steps are being taken to fix it, but it's not going to happen overnight. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=573.74s)]
*  Veteran Air Traffic Controller Jonathan Stewart, we really appreciate you speaking out as we're [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=579.0600000000001s)]
*  being here this morning. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=583.34s)]
*  Thank you for coming. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=584.34s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=585.34s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bSGBdE0j64&t=590.94s)]
