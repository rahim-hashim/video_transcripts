# How Wall Street is reacting to Trump's spending bill
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [July 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg)
*  We're now to CNBC's Dom Chu for more on the economic impact of this bill. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=0.0s)]
*  Dom, with news that it looks like this bill will pass a short time from now, how are markets [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=5.12s)]
*  reacting? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=10.24s)]
*  What does Wall Street think about the impact here? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=11.24s)]
*  So that's the lens that we're looking at all of this through, Willie. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=13.64s)]
*  And to be fair, we've been watching it happen over the course of the last several weeks [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=16.84s)]
*  because the market does become, for whatever it is, a kind of handicapping or discounting [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=21.92s)]
*  mechanism for everything that's developed. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=27.2s)]
*  So we've seen the iterations from the House. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=29.4s)]
*  We've seen what they sent to the Senate. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=32.48s)]
*  We've now seen what the Senate has sent back to the House and what the reconciliation looks [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=35.0s)]
*  like now. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=39.28s)]
*  And all during that span, what the markets have done is make a slow creep higher, but [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=40.44s)]
*  to record highs. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  So as the market tries to assess what the actual impact will be from this legislation, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=49.18s)]
*  the thinking incrementally has been, as each version of this bill has progressed, it is [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=54.9s)]
*  now going to be something that could perhaps stoke economic growth. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=60.22s)]
*  Now, there is a massive debate, of course, because that's the reason why House Minority [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=64.9s)]
*  Leader Hakeem Jeffries is addressing the chamber right now to make their case against this. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=69.74s)]
*  There is a debate about whether or not those types of growth profiles come to their full [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=75.5s)]
*  fruition. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=79.94s)]
*  But for right now, many of the Wall Street folks that we are talking to here seem to [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=81.14s)]
*  feel as though if this bill does pass, that it could unlock a growth profile for America [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=85.32s)]
*  that could lead to higher markets down the line, hence the all-time highs. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=92.5s)]
*  So again, we don't know exactly what it's going to be like. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=96.9s)]
*  We have a lot of projections on this. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=100.56s)]
*  But the idea that Republicans have somehow seemingly come together to get behind this, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=102.86s)]
*  even when Texas Congressman Chip Roy called it quote unquote garbage just yesterday, seems [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=109.26s)]
*  to imply that perhaps there is enough here that makes everybody happy or less happy enough [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=115.5s)]
*  where this can actually get something done and be good for the economy. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=122.22s)]
*  I think you just coined a new term, Dom, less happy enough, which will have to be good enough [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=125.22s)]
*  for now for some people. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=129.86s)]
*  Dom, so what about the idea of $3.3 trillion of debt over 10 years? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=131.22s)]
*  Does that not factor into the calculations that some of these markets are making? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=137.42s)]
*  Sure, it does. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=141.01999999999998s)]
*  And one of the things that we look at with regard to just how much that debt or projected [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=142.29999999999998s)]
*  deficit could factor into this is what happens with the bond market. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=146.54s)]
*  One of the places that you will see that play out more markedly is in U.S. sovereign debt, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=152.1s)]
*  the Treasury market, right? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=156.98s)]
*  And that's the 10-year yield. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=158.1s)]
*  Interestingly enough, we have seen over at least the short term a slight tick higher [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=159.98s)]
*  in just the last couple of days. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=165.74s)]
*  But if you look since the highs that we saw over the course of the last 12 months, we [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=167.5s)]
*  are still relatively low. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=172.26s)]
*  Oftentimes when you have real debt concerns, deficit concerns, it leads to a sell-off of [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=174.74s)]
*  U.S. government debt. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=181.98s)]
*  And what that does lead to is higher interest rates. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=183.7s)]
*  We're not seeing a massive surge higher in U.S. debt interest rates, meaning, at least [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=186.57999999999998s)]
*  for the time being, that some investors and Wall Street traders out there are looking [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=192.62s)]
*  beyond some of the deficit concerns. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=197.5s)]
*  Now, if there were pervasive deficit and debt concerns tied to the so-called big, beautiful [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=199.98000000000002s)]
*  bill, what you could see is a spike higher in interest rates. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=205.74s)]
*  And one of those terms that has been tossed around going back now a couple of decades [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=209.54000000000002s)]
*  is the bond vigilantes, right? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=213.98000000000002s)]
*  Those investors or traders who punish U.S. sovereign debt because of things like deficit [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=215.9s)]
*  and debt management. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=222.42s)]
*  We're not seeing that just yet. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=223.66s)]
*  So Willie, that's something that we're going to be watching for if it does come to fruition [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=225.7s)]
*  over the course of the next few weeks. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=229.5s)]
*  And we should point out one of the reasons perhaps the market corporations like what [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=231.85999999999999s)]
*  they're seeing out of this bill is because it makes permanent the 2017 Trump tax cuts, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=235.38s)]
*  which includes a reduction of the corporate tax rate to 21 percent. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=239.54s)]
*  So we'll keep a close eye on what's happening in the House. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=243.5s)]
*  Meanwhile, President Trump says the United States has reached a trade agreement with [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=245.66s)]
*  Vietnam. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=249.94s)]
*  He made that announcement in a social media post yesterday, writing the deal includes [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=250.94s)]
*  a 20 percent tariff on Vietnam's imports and that the U.S. will have access to Vietnam's [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=254.82s)]
*  markets without paying tariffs. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=260.54s)]
*  According to the president, Vietnam also agreed to impose a 40 percent tariff on goods made [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=262.38s)]
*  in other countries but routed through Vietnam before being shipped to the United States, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=267.22s)]
*  a practice known as trans shipping. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=272.7s)]
*  Think China there. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=275.02s)]
*  It's unclear from Trump's post when the deal will take effect or if it has been officially [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=276.18s)]
*  signed by both parties. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=280.4s)]
*  The 90 day pause on many of President Trump's reciprocal tariffs, by the way, set to expire [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=282.28s)]
*  next Wednesday on July the 9th. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=288.56s)]
*  So Dom, we take the president at his word here for now. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=291.71999999999997s)]
*  That's all we have is what I mean, that he just posted this on True Social. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=296.64s)]
*  We haven't heard any kind of official announcement from Vietnam or from the United States. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=300.32s)]
*  So what is inside this deal? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=304.76s)]
*  This is sort of the rationale for all these massive tariffs that President Trump has been [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=307.54s)]
*  placing which is I'm going to bring people to the table and we're going to make a deal. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=311.68s)]
*  But obviously even bringing the rate down to 20 percent is much higher than it was before [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=316.18s)]
*  he started putting tariffs on countries like Vietnam. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=321.22s)]
*  Sure, Willie. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=323.90000000000003s)]
*  Okay, so here's the phrase I've heard over and over again since that announcement came [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=324.90000000000003s)]
*  out from the White House on True Social, all the official channels. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=328.58000000000004s)]
*  The phrase that I've heard, Willie, is the devil is in the details, right? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=331.90000000000003s)]
*  It's kind of cliched. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=336.1s)]
*  It's coming from all parts of Wall Street, Main Street, K Street, for that matter that [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=337.22s)]
*  we've spoken to here. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=340.78000000000003s)]
*  So here's what we know. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=342.22s)]
*  President Trump announced that bilateral agreement, right? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=344.04s)]
*  20 percent tariff on goods exported from Vietnam to America. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=346.58s)]
*  The U.S. will have tariff free access to markets in Vietnam. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=350.58s)]
*  That compares to the 46 percent tariff that was threatened to go into effect if a deal [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=354.26s)]
*  was not reached before the deadline. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=359.1s)]
*  During this 90 day negotiating period, remember that tariff went down to 10 percent to allow [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=361.98s)]
*  time for this deal to get done. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=367.18s)]
*  Another point of interest has to do with something that you just referred to for that transshipping. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=369.65999999999997s)]
*  You mentioned China. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=373.38s)]
*  That's a big deal because this is when goods are made in a country, shipped to another [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=374.53999999999996s)]
*  country as a waypoint before then making their way to their final destination. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=378.8s)]
*  Transshipping can be used and has been as a loophole to tariff policy. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=384.14s)]
*  But sending goods to a country with lower tariff rates that the originating country [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=388.06s)]
*  already has, in this agreement, the president says that Vietnam has agreed to that 40 percent [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=391.59999999999997s)]
*  tariff on trans shipped goods. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=396.66s)]
*  Now here's where the devil in the detail stuff comes into play. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=399.34000000000003s)]
*  Beyond those broad strokes outlined by the president, there hasn't been any disclosure [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=403.1s)]
*  about whether there will be nuance or exceptions on any goods or types of goods in particular. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=406.62s)]
*  So you think back to trade negotiations between the U.S., Canada and Mexico exemptions for [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=412.1s)]
*  things like autos. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=416.38s)]
*  It's also unclear whether this is a done deal, which has actually been agreed to and signed [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=417.74s)]
*  by both the U.S. and Vietnam. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=422.46000000000004s)]
*  We're still waiting for some kind of official statement from the Vietnamese government itself. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=424.38s)]
*  There's also the question of non tariff barriers, which has been a real sticking point for many [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=429.02s)]
*  of these negotiations between all of our trading partners. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=433.7s)]
*  Even if there are not explicit tariffs on certain goods, the ban of certain imports [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=437.62s)]
*  on certain things or putting specific product standards in place that preclude certain goods. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=443.64s)]
*  Also the currency, the foreign exchange, how you let your currency appreciate or depreciate [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=448.98s)]
*  analysts are going to be looking for a lot of details on that. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=454.34s)]
*  And I'll end on this, Willie. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=456.62s)]
*  You mentioned the China factor with regard to trans shipping. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=458.34s)]
*  Yes, the trade negotiations are still ongoing with China and the U.S. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=461.86s)]
*  But how will Beijing react to the trans shipping clause that was mentioned? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=466.53999999999996s)]
*  Trans shipping is seen by some experts as a jab at China, which does send its products [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=472.26s)]
*  through Vietnam as a way point for certain products to other markets. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=477.53999999999996s)]
*  So how will Beijing react to a deal where Vietnam says it may see it as a way to throttle [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=481.42s)]
*  Chinese exports through that market? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrH13BcfpSg&t=487.9s)]
