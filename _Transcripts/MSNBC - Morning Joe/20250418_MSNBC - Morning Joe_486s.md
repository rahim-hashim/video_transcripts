# Rubio warns U.S. will walk away from Ukraine peace deal if no progress made
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [April 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs)
*  New this morning, Secretary of State Marco Rubio says the United States may move on from [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=0.0s)]
*  efforts to reach a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine if there's no clear progress soon. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=6.24s)]
*  Take a listen to what he said to reporters in Paris this morning as to the state of those [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=11.76s)]
*  negotiations and what America's European allies can do to help move things forward. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  We'd like them to remain engaged. I think they can help us. I think the UK and France and Germany [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=21.36s)]
*  can help us move the ball on this and get this closer to a resolution. I thought they were very [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=26.8s)]
*  helpful and constructive with their ideas. So we welcome their input. We welcome their involvement. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=32.08s)]
*  We think it's important. There are probably elements of this as well. I always remind everybody [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=37.92s)]
*  that part of the sanctions against Russia, many of them, are European sanctions that we can't lift [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=42.96s)]
*  if that's wherever to be part of a deal. So they're going to have to be involved no matter what. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=49.6s)]
*  This war has no military solution to it. It really doesn't. It's not going to be decided. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=54.08s)]
*  Neither side has some strategic capability to end this war quickly. And so what we're talking about [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=58.959999999999994s)]
*  here is avoiding thousands and thousands of people from dying over the next year. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=64.16s)]
*  We're trying to avoid that. We saw what happened last weekend with a missile strike in Sumi [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=68.24s)]
*  where people died on Palm Sunday. We're just going to see more like that on both sides. We're going [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=72.24s)]
*  to see more of that. We're trying to prevent it. But we're not going to continue to fly all over [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=76.24s)]
*  the world and do meeting after meeting after meeting if no progress is being made. So if [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=80.16s)]
*  they're serious about peace, either side or both, we want to help. If it's not going to happen, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=84.88s)]
*  then we're just going to move on. Sir David Ignatius, the Biden [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=89.6s)]
*  administration never said they're going to move on, but I can't underline the fact enough that [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=93.44s)]
*  the Biden administration, I know that you know this, they were saying this going back to 20, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=96.88s)]
*  late 2023, 2024. This is a stalemate. These are like World War I lines. It's a war of attrition. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=101.28s)]
*  Man, at some point, they need to get exhausted and need to make peace. Obviously, that's not [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=108.88s)]
*  happening right now. But Marco Rubio did say that he had confidence in Great Britain, France, and [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=115.36s)]
*  Germany in moving this process along. Tell us where we are right now and what you expect to see in [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=122.24s)]
*  the coming weeks. So Joe, sad to say the effort that President Trump began to bring this war to [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=127.6s)]
*  an acceptable, and that means a lasting and just solution, seems to be running out of gas. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=137.12s)]
*  When I hear the Secretary of State say, well, we may be ready to move on, that tells me that [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=145.04s)]
*  the President is getting bored, that he hasn't made the progress that he wanted. He promised he'd get [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=150.32s)]
*  this done in a day, and then it was a few weeks, and here we are more than two months into his [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=156.32s)]
*  administration. And what he's finding is that his friend, Vladimir Putin, doesn't want to make any [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=162.16s)]
*  concessions, is not, in fact, prepared for the peace process that Donald Trump has teed up. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=169.12s)]
*  Rather than pressure Putin to move him towards a deal that would bring a satisfactory end to [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=175.92s)]
*  this war that would stick through the rest of the administration, Trump, Rubio, their team seem to be [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=182.56s)]
*  getting ready to walk away from it, leaving it in the hands of the Europeans. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=191.11999999999998s)]
*  And I'm sorry to say that despite enormous efforts by the Europeans, the British, French, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  to get ready to take up as much of the American burden of supplying weapons, supplying intelligence, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=201.2s)]
*  they simply don't have the resources. They're not able to make up that gap, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=206.72s)]
*  which means that Ukraine is going to be heading into the summer, absent some changes, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=211.83999999999997s)]
*  in a situation where its losses will be ever greater. The bravery of Ukraine to have fought [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=216.72s)]
*  to this point is extraordinary, the losses they've experienced. But when you hear Rubio say, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=222.95999999999998s)]
*  we're about to move on, you have to think about what that means. That means people naked, vulnerable, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=228.79999999999998s)]
*  without intelligence, or interceptor missiles, Patriot missiles, that can take down the huge [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=235.04s)]
*  ballistic missiles coming into them from Russia, the deaths that are going to result. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=242.64s)]
*  And again, I come back to what Trump correctly said, it's time for this war to end, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=247.51999999999998s)]
*  but it's going to require him to put more effort into it than he's been prepared to so far. You [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=252.48s)]
*  don't just stand there if you're Marco Rubio and say, well, we haven't made any progress, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=257.59999999999997s)]
*  I think that's it. What you do is go back to the parties, in particular, they've already pressured [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=261.2s)]
*  Ukraine, God knows, you go back to Russia and say, this is not acceptable. And if you don't begin to [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=266.15999999999997s)]
*  move and make concessions, we're going to pressure you further. That's what an administration that's [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=271.76s)]
*  serious about negotiating peace would do. You know, Ed Lewis, of course, you're about to release [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=277.03999999999996s)]
*  your biography on Dr. Brzezinski, who warned repeatedly throughout his career about the long [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=285.44s)]
*  history of Russian imperialism. I saw a clip of Richard Nixon from 1974 issuing a dire warning [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=291.76s)]
*  saying we better get it right in Russia. This was again in 1994, because there's a long history [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=298.48s)]
*  of Russian imperialism. And we will not have to fight communism in the next century, but we would [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=304.0s)]
*  have to fight a Russia trying to reconstitute basically the old Russian empire. Remember, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=310.72s)]
*  Mark Brzezinski, Mika's brother, and then the ambassador of Poland correctly pointed out [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=315.52000000000004s)]
*  that Putin doesn't want to reconstitute the Soviet Union. He wants to reconstitute [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=323.12s)]
*  the old Russian empire. And that means that, you know, with the capitals of Odessa and Kiev [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=328.24s)]
*  brought back in under Russia's control, it appears that after all the fighting, all this war, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=333.28000000000003s)]
*  all the talking, we are back where we started in this war. Putin won't be happy until he has Kiev [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=340.24s)]
*  and Odessa. No, no, he won't. And when, you know, Rubio says that they're prepared to walk away [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=347.68s)]
*  from this, what he really means is, as David has just very eloquently set out, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=355.44s)]
*  is he's preparing to pull the plug on Ukraine, because there have been no sustained efforts [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=360.32s)]
*  to get Putin to agree to a real ceasefire. He breached, has breached the one that's about to [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=366.4s)]
*  end, which was just confined to energy infrastructure. As Rubio did mention on Palm Sunday, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=373.2s)]
*  with some really obscene breaches, obscene attacks on civilians during that period [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=380.56s)]
*  as well. So the idea that, you know, by implication, this is Europe and Ukraine, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=387.76s)]
*  the ball is in their court, is completely wrong. The ball should be in Russia's court. It should be [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=395.76s)]
*  Steve Witkoff going to Moscow and delivering, reading the riot act to Putin. Instead, he's [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=402.64s)]
*  going and sort of putting his hand on harp as if he's pledging, sort of the pledging allegiance [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=409.6s)]
*  to Putin. It is an extraordinary, asymmetric, one-sided, 87-day attempt at peace that really [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=415.36s)]
*  doesn't amount to any serious attempt at peace. And I think that Dr. Brzezinski would not be alone [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=423.36s)]
*  in seeing this as a bad faith effort to end the war. And David's right, the war needs to be ended, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=430.40000000000003s)]
*  but this has been a bad faith effort to end the war. Putin is under no pressure from the Trump [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=438.96s)]
*  administration to come to the table. There have been no credible threats. There have been no [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=444.64s)]
*  credible sticks offered to Putin, just carrots. And until that changes, there's not going to be [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=449.59999999999997s)]
*  any kind of credible peace process. Putin was right. All he had to do was wait it out, wait [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=457.59999999999997s)]
*  out the West, wait out the United States. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ceDb0PATMs&t=463.28s)]
