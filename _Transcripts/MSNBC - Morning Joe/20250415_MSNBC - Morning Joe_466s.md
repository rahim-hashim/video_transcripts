# Joe: Trump's trade war is creating opportunities for the rest of the world
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg)
*  John Meats, I want to go to you not only about what happened in the Oval Office yesterday [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=0.0s)]
*  and the message that it is sending around the world. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=7.28s)]
*  I also want to talk about what we discussed, what I was discussing off the top of the show [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  and what I'm hearing over here from business leaders, academics, what I'm hearing from [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=14.72s)]
*  tech leaders, what I'm hearing from everybody I talk to, which is, to use a soccer reference, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=18.76s)]
*  the United States is committing one own goal after another. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=25.16s)]
*  We're scoring on ourselves. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=29.08s)]
*  And as the Wall Street Journal editorial page says today, all of this is creating new economic [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=32.32s)]
*  and diplomatic opportunities, but not for the United States, for China. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=38.94s)]
*  And I'm hearing the same thing out of London, hearing the same thing from academic leaders, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=43.72s)]
*  who again, can't believe that some of the best students on the planet, that they didn't [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=50.36s)]
*  have a shot at getting last year because they'd be going to MIT or Harvard or Berkeley or [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=57.4s)]
*  Stanford are now all applying to their universities. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=63.16s)]
*  And I will say too, not to go on and on, but it is really something. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=70.68s)]
*  I came here in December, one of the reasons I'm here now to hear how shocked they are [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=76.32s)]
*  that we're cutting funding to NIH, not because it's going to hurt them, but because it's [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=83.63999999999999s)]
*  going to drive researchers from America to London, to Paris, across the continent, across [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  the world. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=98.35999999999999s)]
*  It is very surprising that we are giving up all the advantages we are giving up to China, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=100.04s)]
*  as many in Europe are now looking east for new trading opportunities with China. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=108.0s)]
*  One of the ironies of all this is that the America that so many supporters of the president [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=115.24000000000001s)]
*  seemed to want to go back to is the America that was built by the institutions, the impulses, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=124.28s)]
*  the investments that they, I don't even want to say they want to undo them because I don't [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=132.04s)]
*  think they really voted for that. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=136.96s)]
*  They voted for this man and whatever this man does, they're willing to follow. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=138.32s)]
*  But we had this argument from 1945 until 1952. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=144.0s)]
*  Were we going to build walls? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=150.52s)]
*  Were we going to retreat from a world that had led to these two global cataclysms, the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=153.24s)]
*  two world wars? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=159.8s)]
*  Or were we going to engage and invest? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=161.60000000000002s)]
*  It was a ferocious battle. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=164.68s)]
*  There was red baiting. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=167.4s)]
*  There was legitimate arguments about whether we were better off focusing on what Herbert [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=169.56s)]
*  Hoover called the Gibraltar of America, just stand alone if we can. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  And it was really President Eisenhower and President Truman, one Republican, one Democrat. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=184.44000000000003s)]
*  They couldn't stand each other by the time they had sort of ended up on the wrong side [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=189.44s)]
*  of politics. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=193.96s)]
*  So this isn't some sort of dorky nirvana I'm talking about. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=194.96s)]
*  These were competitive political parties, competitive political men who made a decision [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=199.56s)]
*  at the beginning of the Cold War that we were going to compete and we were going to research, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=205.84s)]
*  we were going to build. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=212.96s)]
*  We might not see instant returns on a dollar, but that's what research is. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=215.12s)]
*  To use a biblical illusion, this holy week, it's bread upon the waters. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=221.76000000000002s)]
*  Sometimes it comes back. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=227.06s)]
*  And the builders won that debate. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=228.88s)]
*  And now that's being undone. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=234.0s)]
*  And I think that's one of the particular tragedies. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=236.12s)]
*  There are a lot unfolding at the moment. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=241.04s)]
*  But it is, as you say, it's a self-inflicted wound and one that it may or may not be generational. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=243.56s)]
*  I fear that it is, because if you're a scientist, if you're looking for a stable world in which [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=251.48s)]
*  to pursue your work, what makes you think, after the last decade in American politics, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=259.68s)]
*  that the United States is a stable and safe environment for you to pursue something that [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=266.96s)]
*  may or may not find favor with a particular party? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=272.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, I mean, history is not static, as you know. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=275.96000000000004s)]
*  It's one thing that Europeans have always known. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=279.7s)]
*  in his wonderful essay this past weekend on Dr. Brzezinski, and Henry Kissinger talked [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=283.68s)]
*  about the fact that they did so well as foreign policy leaders, because they were Europeans. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=290.38s)]
*  They escaped the Holocaust. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=301.36s)]
*  They understood that history is never stagnant. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=303.12s)]
*  It's always moving forward. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=307.02s)]
*  The same America that accepted the best and the brightest immigrants from across the world [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=309.0s)]
*  back in the 1970s and the 1980s created Silicon Valley in the 1990s, and in the 21st century, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=313.71999999999997s)]
*  there's a reason why we are light years ahead on technology. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=321.12s)]
*  Look at Silicon Valley. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=325.71999999999997s)]
*  Look at the people who either are immigrants themselves or whose family members were immigrants [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=327.23999999999995s)]
*  themselves. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=332.84s)]
*  Silicon Valley and America's new economy was built, by and large, by immigrants. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=333.84s)]
*  Now where are they going? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=341.71999999999997s)]
*  Will they continue to come to the United States? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=345.15999999999997s)]
*  Right now it doesn't look that way, because it doesn't seem that they are welcome. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=347.23999999999995s)]
*  And when you're going after, when you're slashing research and development programs at the best [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=353.23999999999995s)]
*  institutions on the planet, not the best institutions in Massachusetts, not the best institutions [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=358.59999999999997s)]
*  in the United States, but the best institutions on the planet, the United States of America [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=362.92s)]
*  has had pretty consistently the top 15 of the top 25 universities on the planet. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=369.08s)]
*  They've had like 15 out of the top 25 on the planet, in large part because of research [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=374.6s)]
*  and development funding that did come from the government. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=381.56s)]
*  We want to cut it off. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=384.48s)]
*  We want to cut it off for political reasons. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=385.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=387.15999999999997s)]
*  But understand the price, not just the price this year or next year, the generational price [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=388.15999999999997s)]
*  when the best and the brightest of people that are going to be on the cutting edge of [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=393.84000000000003s)]
*  what comes next are doing it out of Oxford or Cambridge or as I said on the continent [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=398.02000000000004s)]
*  or in China for God's sake. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=406.62s)]
*  I mean, it is really it is again, as the Wall Street Journal says today, we are creating [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=410.78000000000003s)]
*  opportunities right now for the rest of the world unless we don't adjust a lot of these [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=416.86s)]
*  policies pretty quickly. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=423.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=425.5s)]
*  All this around the news, this back and forth between Harvard and the Trump administration, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=426.5s)]
*  Trump administration saying yesterday that it's going to hold up $2.2 billion in federal [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=430.54s)]
*  funding for Harvard. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=435.82s)]
*  Now Harvard has a $53 billion endowment. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=437.38s)]
*  Those schools always say it's for a rainy day, starting to feel like a rainy day around [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=440.94s)]
*  there. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=444.42s)]
*  We'll see if they dip into it. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21w5g3Bq4Qg&t=445.42s)]
