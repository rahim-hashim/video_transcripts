Video Description: President Donald Trump said Thursday that he would nominate outgoing national security adviser Mike Waltz to be the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Waltz, a former congressman from Florida, has been on shaky ground with Trump since March after he inadvertently added a journalist to a private chat on the messaging app Signal with other top national security officials to discuss military strikes in Yemen.

# Waltz's issues within Trump WH predate Signalgate scandal: Report
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc)
*  Willie, a lot of moves in Washington and the Trump administration yesterday take us through them. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=0.0s)]
*  All right, well let's start with Mike Waltz. He no longer is the national security advisor. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=6.0s)]
*  President Trump made that announcement yesterday on Truth Social saying he instead is nominating [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=10.32s)]
*  Waltz to be UN ambassador. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will now serve as the interim national [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  security advisor while holding on to his current positions. He's got a few of them. The deputy [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=21.2s)]
*  national security advisor Alex Wong also leaving the Trump administration. Waltz has been facing [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=26.08s)]
*  increased scrutiny since March when the editor in chief of the Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, revealed [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=32.16s)]
*  he was added to a signal group chat with administration officials in which they discussed [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=37.12s)]
*  Yemen attack plans. Waltz took responsibility for creating that chat and for accidentally adding [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=41.599999999999994s)]
*  Goldberg. At that time, Trump publicly stood by Waltz telling reporters Waltz had learned his [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  lesson and that he's a good man. Last week in an interview with the Atlantic, the president said [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=53.76s)]
*  Waltz is quote fine despite being beat up by the signal chat controversy. Now the Atlantic reports [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=58.72s)]
*  Waltz's issues within the Trump administration predated that scandal. People familiar with the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=66.0s)]
*  matter say Waltz did not work well with senior members of the Trump team and could not prove to [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=71.2s)]
*  the president he was able to manage his own staff. Yesterday, Waltz acknowledged the change in his [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=76.47999999999999s)]
*  role writing on social media, I am deeply honored to continue my service to President Trump and our [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=81.28s)]
*  great nation. Vice President JD Vance told Fox News this should be seen as a step up for Waltz. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=86.56s)]
*  It wasn't let go. He is being made ambassador to the United Nations which of course is a [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=94.64s)]
*  Senate confirmed position. I think he can make a good argument that it's a promotion. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=98.48s)]
*  But we brought Mike on to do some serious reforms to the National Security Council. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=102.4s)]
*  He has done that. I think the media wants to frame this as a firing. Donald Trump has fired a lot of [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=107.12s)]
*  people. He doesn't give them Senate confirmed appointments afterwards. What he thinks is that [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=112.24000000000001s)]
*  Mike Waltz is going to better serve the administration, most importantly the American people in that role [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  and I happen to agree with him. So David Ignatius, you've been reporting on this story quite a bit. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=120.64s)]
*  Mike Waltz maybe never a favorite of the diehard Trump loyalists. On the other hand, Pete Hegseth, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=126.16000000000001s)]
*  the defense secretary who as we heard many senators saying yesterday thought he should have [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=133.04s)]
*  been the one to lose his job. He hangs on to his job a little bit more popular with the MAGA [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=136.64s)]
*  movement. So what's your sense of what exactly happened here? So really I'd say first of all, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=142.07999999999998s)]
*  Waltz is the fall guy for what we call Signalgate. He originated the chat. It seems he had [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=148.32s)]
*  Jeffrey Goldberg, our Atlantic friend, on his contact list and somehow he got in that chat. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=156.0s)]
*  So that's a part of this. There had been rumors for many weeks that the White House was interviewing [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=161.68s)]
*  for a successor to Waltz as national security advisor. A lot of people it said didn't want the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=167.44s)]
*  job, were nervous about it. I reported this morning that beneath the obvious explanation of [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=172.96s)]
*  Signalgate, you see that all the cross currents, ideological, personality, other factors beneath [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=180.0s)]
*  Trump. Trump is really the only solid pole in his administration. Beneath him, I said there are [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=189.04s)]
*  really three discernible groups. One is around JD Vance. We call him the kind of MAGA believers, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=196.4s)]
*  strongly supported by Trump's own son Donald Trump Jr. playing a role in this administration, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=205.28s)]
*  very much like Jared Kushner and his wife Ivanka, Trump's daughter played in the first Trump term. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=211.68s)]
*  There's another group that I'd say Waltz was part of, the traditional national security Republicans. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=218.56s)]
*  And then there's a third fascinating group, the big business billionaires, the oligarchs, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=223.84s)]
*  Elon Musk, obviously, Scott Bessent, the Treasury Secretary, Howard Ludnick, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=231.52s)]
*  the Commerce Secretary. So there is this ferment underneath Trump and we saw a bit of it, I think, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=236.24s)]
*  in yesterday's action. Waltz will be away from the White House where there wasn't good chemistry [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=241.52s)]
*  between him and Trump. And interestingly, Marco Rubio, who used to be seen as on the outs, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=245.84s)]
*  has managed to charm his way into Trump's inner circle, has been very supportive. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=250.96s)]
*  You never see Marco Rubio say anything, but great job, Mr. President. He's now going to be at Trump's [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=256.32s)]
*  side as the temporary national security advisor. So, you know, Trump world spins underneath, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=262.16s)]
*  but you must recognize that there is one person making policy. Don't know what it is [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=268.96s)]
*  from day to day sometimes, but that's Donald Trump. Yeah, the guy you used to call little Marco [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=275.52s)]
*  is now doing the full Kissinger. I mean, Secretary of State, National Security Advisor. Let's talk, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=281.03999999999996s)]
*  every single signal gate, and I get that, but let's talk about ideologically what lies beneath. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=288.24s)]
*  And that is, this is a guy who's still seen suspiciously as a neocon. He's been pushing [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=294.4s)]
*  hard for tough sanctions, real sanctions against Putin and Russia if they don't come through on the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=300.8s)]
*  ceasefire. And even this past week, reports are that he was pushing really hard inside the [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=309.28000000000003s)]
*  administration for really tough measures taken against Russia if they don't step into their own. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=315.52000000000004s)]
*  That's just not what the president or the administration wants to do. Yeah, he just was [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=324.16s)]
*  never a good fit. There were voices like Mike Walz's in Trump's first term. In the second term, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=328.48s)]
*  he has little patience for dissenting points of view. He was right from the beginning. He was not [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=333.36s)]
*  seen as sufficiently loyal. He was not seen as MAGA enough. He was indeed too much for traditional [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=338.32s)]
*  Republican or a neocon. Trump liked him because he thought he'd be a strong defender of his policies [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=342.24s)]
*  on television. He then felt like that wasn't working either. Walz was not doing a good job [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=346.64000000000004s)]
*  on TV, which matters so much to this president. Let's not overlook the Laura Loomer moment here, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=351.76s)]
*  where she came into the Oval Office a few weeks ago, got some of Walz's staff fired, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=356.08s)]
*  also planted more seeds of doubt with Trump about Walz himself. Signalgate was sort of the final [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=360.56s)]
*  straw, but it wasn't the only thing that was going on here. In fact, the administration was so dead [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=366.56s)]
*  set on not giving any, in their words, any scalps to the media that they didn't want to have any [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=372.56s)]
*  immediate firings. Trump himself said, I don't want anything to disrupt as we report in that [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=378.0s)]
*  Atlantic story for the first 100 days. Well, you know, that's one of the things that was [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=382.64s)]
*  surprising when I heard the news. I said, wait a second. This goes against his hope that there's [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=385.76s)]
*  not that turnover. And then we saw later in the afternoon, actually, he's moving him to watch [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=391.84s)]
*  J.D. Vance said was actually a promotion. I was just joking during the clip. I wonder if Jimmy [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=395.76s)]
*  Carter had tried to sell that to Dr. Brzezinski, how that would have gone. As the vice president [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=402.32s)]
*  said, you can make the argument that it's a promotion. It might not win that argument. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=406.64s)]
*  But we also should note the calendar here. He didn't want any change to the first 100 days. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=411.03999999999996s)]
*  Walt's out on day 101. That was part of this as well. So, Ann, let's talk about the bigger [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=414.64s)]
*  implications here for Walt's move, because as we, as some of our colleagues at the Atlantic noted, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=420.4s)]
*  even in the initial hours, this was seen as some alarm with some allies because Walt's was more [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=427.59999999999997s)]
*  of a conventional Republican believer in NATO. Yet Trump himself last week or so is toyed with [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=433.44s)]
*  the idea of Russian sanctions, but certainly not to the degree that Walt's was pushing [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=439.36s)]
*  because there's lack of a ceasefire. So talk to us about how this will be perceived around the [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=443.44s)]
*  world as, again, what Trump 2.0 really means in terms of foreign policy. So it's even deeper and [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=448.32s)]
*  weirder than just NATO. What we're seeing is a kind of patrimonialist, a paternalist [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=454.72s)]
*  administration where only one person makes decisions. Trump decides, Trump takes away, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=461.52000000000004s)]
*  Trump wakes up one morning and he says mean things about Putin and he wakes up the next [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=468.24s)]
*  morning and changes his mind. And that's very, very hard for American allies, for American partners, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=473.28000000000003s)]
*  for American trading partners to understand and to be able to plan. They don't have anybody to talk [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=479.6s)]
*  to in this administration. They're not sure when they speak to somebody at the National Security [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=486.8s)]
*  Council, are they speaking to someone who represents the president? When they talk to someone at the [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=491.2s)]
*  State Department, is it someone who represents the president? Even the fact that Marco Rubio is now [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=495.12s)]
*  Secretary of State, acting National Security Advisor, he's also acting head of USAID and I [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=501.92s)]
*  believe he's still acting head of the National Archives. Yes, four jobs, that's right. That's [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=506.8s)]
*  right. That's not a good sign. It means that none of these institutions is being properly run or [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=510.48s)]
*  properly taken seriously or his real leadership. And that's confusing for anyone who's trying to [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=518.64s)]
*  plan a strategy, who's trying to understand how to talk to the United States, how to understand [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=523.92s)]
*  what our trade policy is, our NATO policy, our military policy. And by the way, Anne, that's not [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=528.4s)]
*  just among the chocolate makers of Europe, as Rumsfeld would say. These are some like [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=533.36s)]
*  hardcore supporters of Donald Trump across the world. You go through the Middle East and you, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=541.1999999999999s)]
*  you know, and they will say well, you know, there's some good things. We can get things done more [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=547.52s)]
*  quickly. We don't have to worry about the red tape and that's great. But just like you said, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=553.12s)]
*  every morning they wake up, they're wondering which direction is he going to go today? What [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=558.08s)]
*  are we going to need to change today? Yeah, I talked to a Middle Eastern ambassador not that [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=562.16s)]
*  long ago who was from a Trump country that's very pro-Trump and is very excited about him [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=566.08s)]
*  having won the election and it was exactly that kind of caution. So, okay, it's great that he's [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=572.0s)]
*  there, but, you know, he had one policy on Gaza a couple weeks ago and he might have a different [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=577.68s)]
*  one next week and he's not very interested in the details of actually how you would, what's going to [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=583.52s)]
*  happen to the Palestinian people who live there. He doesn't care about them and we're not sure who [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=589.5999999999999s)]
*  else around him is going to be making that decision, if anybody. Yeah. Well, I guess, David, one of the [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=595.04s)]
*  people that won't be is Mike Walz. JD Vance's line about this being a promotion was just mildly [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=600.4799999999999s)]
*  less implausible than Senator Mullins who said yesterday that what actually this was about was [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=606.64s)]
*  Walz wanting to spend time with his young family and the idea that you would then take on the UN [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=611.6s)]
*  ambassadorship because you want a family time, but anyway, he seemed to insist that was the case. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=616.08s)]
*  One thing that I have heard is that this was from the groups, the sort of three groups that [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=619.6s)]
*  David Ignatius was laying out, that the first group with the JD Vance, who were the real Hawks and [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=624.5600000000001s)]
*  Don Jr., is that they also are looking at Iran and Russia and they felt that Mike Walz was being [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=629.52s)]
*  too tough on Iran and they also felt they didn't want him to push Russia as hard as he's been [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=636.72s)]
*  pushing from within the White House. Can you lay out that theory anymore and why that might have [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=642.24s)]
*  got Walz out of sorts with the president in the White House? Because I think it's pointing out [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=649.4399999999999s)]
*  this basic problem of the president achieving what he promised. There's no peace in Ukraine after a [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=655.36s)]
*  single day. He's talking about an Iran deal that looks a lot like the Obama deal with Iran that he [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=660.32s)]
*  canceled and it's not a promotion. If there's a backwater for the Trump administration, it's the UN [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=665.44s)]
*  and the broader problem is just the utter lack of experience on the entire national security team. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=671.6800000000001s)]
*  Other than Marco Rubio, who has tremendous experience in Congress, you've got Pete Hegseth, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=676.72s)]
*  who's struggling to run the Pentagon. Walz is now out and he's a decorated special forces soldier. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=682.64s)]
*  He serves this country incredibly well and was put in a very difficult position. He had no experience [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=691.04s)]
*  to serve as national security advisor. So you see this over and over again. The loyalty to the [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=695.92s)]
*  president, people who will message and give these sort of simple answers to the MAGA base, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=700.24s)]
*  and change and chaos and instability. It's similar in some ways to the first term. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=706.08s)]
*  We should note some of the political implications here. This does seem to buy Hegseth some time, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=710.64s)]
*  but Mike Walz now has to go to a confirmation hearing. Signalgate is going to dominate that [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=714.24s)]
*  hearing. Not great for him, but also going to revive some questions about Hegseth, no doubt, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=718.8s)]
*  and that whole scandal, Joe. We should also note that the Trump administration [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=723.52s)]
*  picked three Republicans from the House to fill positions within the administration. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=726.8s)]
*  Matt Gaetz never made it. Elise Stefanik had to be withdrawn from UN Ambassador. Now Mike Walz, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=730.3199999999999s)]
*  losing the national security advisor, yes, gets a consolation prize in Turtle Bay, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=736.48s)]
*  but gave up a very safe congressional seat for a pretty tough hundred days. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=741.12s)]
*  Yeah, and most likely a tough election coming up next year. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKbPz4rRdMc&t=744.88s)]
