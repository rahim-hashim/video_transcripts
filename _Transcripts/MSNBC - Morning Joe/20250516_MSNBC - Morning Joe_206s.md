# On return flight, Tump has conference call with Zelenskyy and European leaders
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo)
*  A shot of the White House there. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump just a short time ago concluded his Middle East trip. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=3.58s)]
*  Wheels up on Air Force One. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=8.4s)]
*  And Peter Baker, it's been an eventful flight, it appears, as we have learned in the last [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=9.6s)]
*  little bit that President Trump was on a conference call with President Zelensky as well as the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=13.68s)]
*  leaders of UK, Germany, France, other European nations. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=18.56s)]
*  He also took the time to take a swipe at Taylor Swift on social media. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=21.72s)]
*  So I'll let you pick which of those things you want to weigh in on now. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=25.48s)]
*  I know you have to wonder whether he and the leaders were discussing Taylor Swift. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=28.96s)]
*  And that's what prompted the tweet. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=32.24s)]
*  It's hard to imagine. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=34.36s)]
*  But yeah, clearly, he's about three hours into this trip and he's a little bored. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=35.36s)]
*  But yeah, he's using the tree. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=38.0s)]
*  He's using the flight to make some obviously important phone calls. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=41.0s)]
*  And it's interesting to hear that he's talking with Zelensky and the European leaders. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=45.84s)]
*  European leaders, of course, are on Zelensky's side in this. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=49.44s)]
*  They are his validators with Trump. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=52.24s)]
*  And they are trying to make sure this relationship with Zelensky and Trump, which has been, of [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=55.08s)]
*  course, so fraught, especially since that Oval Office meltdown, is a more productive [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=59.8s)]
*  one. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=65.52s)]
*  In fact, Trump is more sympathetic to Zelensky than he was a month or two ago when they had [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=66.52s)]
*  that confrontation. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=70.88s)]
*  And Trump begins to see that Putin is the obstacle to peace here and not Zelensky. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  So it's interesting that Zelensky is there with his friends in effect, using them as [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=77.84s)]
*  validators with the president. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=82.24s)]
*  I do think that is a key and interesting piece of this, though I would also add that Taylor [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=84.12s)]
*  Swift does have a song called Peace. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=88.48s)]
*  Maybe that is a relevant connector to these two seemingly disparate threads. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=90.8s)]
*  I do think the other thing that I'm thinking about, John, is the fact that when I was on [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=94.96s)]
*  way too early this morning, we were talking to someone, a reporter who focuses on the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=98.92s)]
*  Middle East and the dynamics from that viewpoint of the president's trip. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=102.96s)]
*  And I asked, certainly at home, we are all preoccupied with the issue looming over this [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=107.64s)]
*  trip, which is the gifting of the Qatari jumbo jet. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=112.48s)]
*  But when I asked this reporter, is that looming over the trip physically in the Middle East? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=115.24000000000001s)]
*  He said that a lot of the Middle Eastern leaders were not focused on that and that instead [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  the conversations truly were focused on the economic investments and other key pieces [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=124.12s)]
*  like that in the region. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=129.24s)]
*  So it strikes me that maybe this could be a news cycle that continues once Trump more [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=131.12s)]
*  fully turns his attention to it. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=135.42000000000002s)]
*  He's been defensive of this idea of a gift, saying he'd be dumb not to take it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=137.32s)]
*  Republicans on Capitol Hill have a myriad number of disagreement points with that. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  But when this comes to a head and if it finds another head to come to here when he's back [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=146.72s)]
*  home, I think that's something that I'm looking out to a head for next week. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=150.6s)]
*  Yeah, we certainly we know that President Trump is defensive of the plane. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=154.72s)]
*  We'll see what how he talks about it once he lands. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=159.67999999999998s)]
*  The White House, pleased with the economic agreements reached in the Middle East. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=161.76s)]
*  Trump also now just taking a social media attacking, as he put it, radical left efforts [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=164.95999999999998s)]
*  to intimidate the Supreme Court about the birthright citizenship cases that we were [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=170.0s)]
*  talking about earlier this morning and eventful flight. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=174.36s)]
*  And he has many hours to go in the air. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=177.56s)]
*  So we will see what happens next. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=180.52s)]
*  Ali Vitali and Peter Baker, thank you both. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  Enjoy your weekend. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wRjI3DJGXo&t=185.16s)]
