# At least 27 hurt as van hits pedestrians at parade celebrating soccer win in England
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg)
*  That tragedy in Liverpool yesterday. Yeah at least 27 people this morning [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=0.0s)]
*  hospitalized including four children after a minivan crashed through a group [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=5.8s)]
*  of pedestrians at a soccer parade. At least one adult and one child suffered [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=10.4s)]
*  very serious injuries. At the time thousands of people had lined the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=14.96s)]
*  streets to celebrate Liverpool's Premier League title win. Video shows the minivan [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=18.44s)]
*  traveling at a high speed and plowing through the crowd before it came to a [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  stop. The driver was arrested at the scene. He's described as a 53 year old [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=26.78s)]
*  British man. Authorities say the crash is not being investigated as terrorism [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=31.42s)]
*  related and no one else is being sought in connection with what police are [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=36.1s)]
*  calling an isolated incident. Let's bring in NBC News foreign correspondent [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=40.260000000000005s)]
*  Raph Sanchez live from the scene of the incident in Liverpool. Raph, what's the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=44.02s)]
*  latest there? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=48.46s)]
*  Well, Willie, as you can see, a major police investigation is now underway [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=51.66s)]
*  trying to understand how this joyful championship parade turned really into [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=55.14s)]
*  a scene of horror. I just want to explain the geography here. We are at [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=60.02s)]
*  the bottom of Water Street. This is one of the main drags in central Liverpool [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=63.58s)]
*  and less than 24 hours ago you had tens of thousands of soccer fans on both [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=68.22s)]
*  sides of the street. They were cheering some of the sport's biggest stars fresh [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=73.54s)]
*  off their championship win in the English Premier League coming down and [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=77.9s)]
*  then that dark minivan came careening into the crowd. So just to explain that [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=82.22s)]
*  minivan is still parked on the street. It is on the other side of that large [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=88.48s)]
*  police vehicle, which is obscuring the view and detectives are continuing to [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=93.5s)]
*  carry out forensic investigations. As you said, the driver of that minivan is [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=97.58s)]
*  under arrest. Police are saying he is a 53 year old white British man and [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=102.58s)]
*  viewers may be wondering why are the police mentioning his race? And our best [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=108.7s)]
*  guess as to that Willie is that last year there were major riots in this [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=113.06s)]
*  country sparked by misinformation on social media after a violent attack. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=118.26s)]
*  People on social media accusing falsely a migrant of carrying out that attack. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=123.78s)]
*  So we believe that is the reason police are mentioning race in this case. Now, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=129.72s)]
*  as you said, nearly 50 people were injured when that van came slamming into [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=134.78s)]
*  the crowd. Four of them were Children. One of those kids, Willie was actually [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=139.74s)]
*  trapped underneath the van. Firefighters had to lift the van, pull that child out [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=144.54s)]
*  to safety. One child is seriously injured, but miraculously no one has [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=149.58s)]
*  been killed in this incident. At least so far, a number of people are still in [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=156.14s)]
*  the hospital. Police are saying they are not treating this as an act of terrorism. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=162.38s)]
*  They are saying they believe this is an isolated incident and they aren't [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=166.85999999999999s)]
*  looking for anyone else, but they have so far not laid out their understanding [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=170.98s)]
*  of what the motivations are here. They haven't brought any charges yet against [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=175.94s)]
*  the person in custody or anyone else. So we may understand a little bit more if [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=180.73999999999998s)]
*  and when those charges are brought, but we are hearing just a wave of condolence [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=185.78s)]
*  and solidarity coming from across the world of sport, including from LeBron [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=193.02s)]
*  James, who's actually a part owner of Liverpool Football Club. And I can tell [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=197.9s)]
*  you guys the anthem of that soccer team is you will never walk alone. It is a [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=203.22s)]
*  song that you hear chanted at Anfield by the fans here. That's the major soccer [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=209.18s)]
*  stadium. And there is a real feeling in this city today that people are not [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=214.58s)]
*  walking alone, that they are supporting each other to get through this tragedy. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=219.18s)]
*  Raph, just to go back to a point you made earlier, the police have determined [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=222.98000000000002s)]
*  this is not an act of terrorism. So they do know something about what happened. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=226.10000000000002s)]
*  Do they talk at all about what this may have been? Was it a medical incident? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=231.14000000000001s)]
*  Was the person drunk? What is there any idea of what took place yesterday? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=235.66000000000003s)]
*  So Willie, there are very strict laws here in the UK about what authorities [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=241.7s)]
*  can say once somebody has been arrested. That is with the goal of not biasing a [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=247.45999999999998s)]
*  future jury trial. I can tell you our team at NBC News has verified a number [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=252.78s)]
*  of videos taken before the minivan crashed into the crowd, and it does [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=257.58s)]
*  appear to show some kind of confrontation between the driver of that [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=262.7s)]
*  vehicle and a number of soccer fans. You can see people banging on the sides of [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=267.3s)]
*  the car. One person tries to open the door of that car. So we simply do not [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=271.90000000000003s)]
*  know what the motivation is, but it appears that the driver was in control, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=277.62s)]
*  but in a high stress situation in the minutes before he plowed into the crowd. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=281.78000000000003s)]
*  We just at this point do not know what the motivation was, and we don't really [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=287.82s)]
*  understand whether or not or to what degree this was intentional. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=292.78000000000003s)]
*  More than 50 people injured, a couple of them very seriously. NBC's Raph Sanchez [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=296.97999999999996s)]
*  live in Liverpool, England. Raph, thanks so much. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx5wRBukypg&t=301.58s)]
