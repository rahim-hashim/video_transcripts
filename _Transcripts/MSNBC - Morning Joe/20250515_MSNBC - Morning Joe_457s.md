# 25 percent pay cut: Harvard president to reduce salary amid White House funding battle
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M)
*  Time now for a look at some of the other stories making headlines this morning at 24 past the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=0.0s)]
*  hour. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=5.28s)]
*  The president of Harvard is taking a 25 percent pay cut amid the university's battle with [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=6.28s)]
*  the Trump administration. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=11.52s)]
*  It's unclear how much money he makes, but the move is largely symbolic, as the White [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=12.6s)]
*  House has blocked more than $2.5 billion in federal funding for the school. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=17.42s)]
*  Harvard has been trying to offset those costs by pausing hiring and merit-based raises for [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=24.36s)]
*  some non-union faculty members. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=31.36s)]
*  So John Lemire, the New York Times had an article, Michael Schmitt had an article out [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=34.8s)]
*  last week that Harvard loses anyway you look at this. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=39.879999999999995s)]
*  Even if they win the court battle, how are they going to get funding over the next several [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=44.6s)]
*  years for the research money? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=48.24s)]
*  And as much as any school since World War II, Harvard has become very dependent on money [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=50.800000000000004s)]
*  from the federal government for research and development because that's how the United [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=59.0s)]
*  States invests in research and development. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=62.72s)]
*  They go to the best schools, spend a lot of money. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=65.6s)]
*  And so, yeah, so even if they win in court, the feeling is they're probably going to lose [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=68.68s)]
*  in the long run because where will the funding come next year and the next year? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=73.92s)]
*  You hope sanity will return to Congress, but doubtful. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I'm certainly a surge in alumni donations, but that can't offset some of the money that [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=82.4s)]
*  the federal government would direct for research. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=87.44s)]
*  And on that point, there's such a spillover effect here. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=89.68s)]
*  The Boston Globe actually had a great piece in the last couple days that Harvard and some [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=91.8s)]
*  of those other schools in the greater Boston area, because of the work that they do, has [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=95.2s)]
*  really fueled the economy of that region. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=99.32000000000001s)]
*  And they're already seeing real changes there because of the cutbacks to these universities [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=101.12s)]
*  and the fears that more could come. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=106.44s)]
*  So, yeah, and I think other schools are obviously watching what's happening in Harvard, making [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=108.18s)]
*  their own decisions. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=111.88000000000001s)]
*  We have seen some, like Columbia, not put up much of a fight against the administration, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=112.88000000000001s)]
*  others looking more towards the Harvard model. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=116.5s)]
*  You know, David, what's so shocking to me is that members of Congress understand, especially [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=117.94000000000001s)]
*  the ones that have the relevant committees, they understand that America's research and [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=123.30000000000001s)]
*  development that has kept us ahead, whether you're talking about the military industrial [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=127.5s)]
*  complex, whether you're talking about Intel, whether you're talking now about AI, whether [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=132.86s)]
*  you're talking about the technological revolution of the early 1990s, that happened. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=137.57999999999998s)]
*  So much of that was fueled out of research and development coming from whether it was [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=143.06s)]
*  Harvard, MIT, Yale, Penn, Stanford, the best schools on the planet. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=147.34s)]
*  That happened because the federal government funded their research and development operations. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=153.38s)]
*  There's not like, you know, Bob's R&D shop in Omaha, Omaha, Nebraska, that's going to [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=158.78s)]
*  be able to take this on. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=165.1s)]
*  So while the president's making his point, America's falling further and further behind [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=167.06s)]
*  in R&D. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=171.14000000000001s)]
*  And again, you know, when I'm in Britain, when I'm in Europe, they're getting about [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=172.14000000000001s)]
*  the fact that they're getting the best and the brightest students that were coming to [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=177.82s)]
*  the United States that will not come to the United States now, but instead will be researching [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=181.70000000000002s)]
*  at King's College, Cambridge or Oxford. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=186.34s)]
*  Or you pick the school in Britain and Europe. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=189.78s)]
*  And where are the Republicans in Congress standing up going, we're losing our R&D advantage [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=194.34s)]
*  every single day. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=202.5s)]
*  This goes on. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=204.78s)]
*  They talk about DEI, DEI, DEI. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=205.78s)]
*  OK, we'll take care of DEI. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=208.9s)]
*  But don't slash R&D to these institutions that, again, since World War II, have driven [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=211.42000000000002s)]
*  America's technological and economic prowess. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=220.45999999999998s)]
*  You know, Joe, the scariest thing is that they may be breaking this exquisite machine [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=226.05999999999997s)]
*  precisely because it is so good. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=231.94s)]
*  Because it's elite. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=235.22s)]
*  Because Harvard and Stanford and these other universities, Johns Hopkins, are world leaders. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=237.26s)]
*  And there is an anger that is inexplicable to me. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=243.94s)]
*  You know, as you say, once you begin to break apart a lab, it's hard to put it back together. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=248.02s)]
*  The kids in that lab have to go find work somewhere else. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=254.58s)]
*  I go to Amsterdam, or I go to Oxford, or Singapore. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=257.98s)]
*  And you'll never put that research group together quite again. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=262.86s)]
*  So I hope you got it exactly right. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=267.54s)]
*  People need to look at what we're losing and how long it will take to put it back together. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=270.84000000000003s)]
*  Officials in Argentina are combing through a startling discovery. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=277.3s)]
*  Boxes full of Nazi propaganda from World War II. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=282.02000000000004s)]
*  The documents stamped with swastikas had been stored in the basement of the country's Supreme [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=285.94s)]
*  Court for more than eight decades. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=292.14s)]
*  That whole Argentina thing. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=295.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=297.46000000000004s)]
*  Check. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=298.46000000000004s)]
*  Officials say the material was brought there in 1941 from the German embassy in Tokyo and [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=299.46000000000004s)]
*  was intended to consolidate Hitler's ideology in Argentina. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=305.62s)]
*  Researchers and members of the local Jewish community held a ceremony as they began to [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=312.18s)]
*  catalog the contents. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=316.46s)]
*  And overdose deaths in the U.S. fell by nearly 30,000 last year. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=319.5s)]
*  The largest one-year decline on record. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=324.82s)]
*  An estimated 80,000 people died from overdoses in 2024, according to the CDC. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=327.46s)]
*  That is down 27% from the year prior. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=333.38s)]
*  That previous largest one-year drop was 4%. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=336.82s)]
*  However, annual overdose deaths remain higher than they were before the pandemic. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=340.78s)]
*  Experts cite several factors for the decline, from the increased availability of overdose [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=346.98s)]
*  reversing medications to expanded addiction treatments. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=351.74s)]
*  And the question is, are those going to be cut now? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=356.86s)]
*  I've heard the possibility that some of that funding is going to be cut as well. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=360.06s)]
*  But you look, 2024, we saw crime down. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=364.5s)]
*  We saw a lot of economic factors going up. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=369.38s)]
*  A lot of teenage pregnancy way down. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=372.22s)]
*  Overdose deaths way down. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=375.98s)]
*  A lot of quality of life and social trend lines going in the right direction in 2024. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=377.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=383.26s)]
*  I mean, this is objectively good news. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=384.26s)]
*  We debate things. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=386.66s)]
*  Politics is injected into everything, but this is good news when there were 30,000 fewer [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=388.06s)]
*  deaths last year than the year before. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=391.62s)]
*  27% decline in drug fatalities. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=393.94s)]
*  Still way too many. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=396.90000000000003s)]
*  Over 80,000 a year. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=397.90000000000003s)]
*  It's still the leading cause of death for young people in America. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=398.90000000000003s)]
*  The CDC, under the Trump administration, did inject a little politics into their announcement [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=402.70000000000005s)]
*  of this, giving President Trump credit for it. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=407.02000000000004s)]
*  His first term, his first administration did start an initiative against opioids, so he [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=409.74s)]
*  deserves some credit. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=413.94000000000005s)]
*  So to, of course, does the Biden administration. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=415.22s)]
*  So to your point, let's keep this going, is what all the doctors are saying. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=417.82s)]
*  Concurrently you had HHS Secretary Kennedy up on Capitol Hill talking about the cuts [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=423.98s)]
*  he's going to be making to that department. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=427.98s)]
*  These doctors are saying, please, we're moving in the right direction on this epidemic in [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=429.74s)]
*  our country. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=433.74s)]
*  Please don't make those cuts. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=434.74s)]
*  Well, speaking of, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BClF9P9Vx3M&t=435.74s)]
