# Black smoke emerges from Sistine Chapel, no pope has been selected
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk)
*  Let's get back to the pope. Cardinals have not yet selected a new pope. The second vote [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=0.0s)]
*  of the day just wrapped up, just before the show started, with black smoke rising from [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=6.82s)]
*  the top of the Sistine Chapel. The ballots are only burned after two rounds of voting, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=11.72s)]
*  unless a selection is made. Yesterday, we also saw black smoke rise above the Sistine [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=18.2s)]
*  Chapel. If we see white smoke, it signifies there is a new leader of the Catholic Church. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=24.36s)]
*  A two-thirds majority needs to be reached in order for that to happen. Two more votes [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=33.64s)]
*  will be held today. Out of the more 250 cardinals in Vatican City, only 133 are eligible to [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=39.84s)]
*  vote under those the age of 80 can cast a ballot. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=48.4s)]
*  Hey Mike Barnacle, obviously you're following this pretty closely. Right now, what's going [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=52.16s)]
*  on? I know there are a lot of different segments of the Catholic Church that are pushing and [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=61.959999999999994s)]
*  pulling. What's the word that you've heard? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=69.44s)]
*  Well, there were two votes this morning. They break for lunch and there will be two votes [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=73.88s)]
*  later this afternoon. And we'll look for the black and the white smoke. I think what's [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=77.56s)]
*  going on is largely ideological. And the direction of the Church going forward. They [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=82.12s)]
*  continue with Pope Francis' opening up of the Church's liberalization in the views [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=90.4s)]
*  of many. Or do they return to a more conservative papacy? We're going to find that out. We're [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=96.52000000000001s)]
*  going to find out the impact of the global south on the Catholic Church. I mean, the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  growth of the Catholic Church is much higher in the global south than it is in Europe or [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=108.04s)]
*  the United States of America. And that, I think, is going to have an impact on the vote [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=113.48s)]
*  and on the next papacy. Let's go to the Vatican. That's where we find Bishop Robert Barron [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=117.16000000000001s)]
*  of the Diocese of Winona Rochester in Minnesota. Bishop, thanks for being with us today. So [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=121.68s)]
*  black smoke. We still wait for the white smoke. Reminding our viewers, the last two popes [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=128.4s)]
*  were elected on the second day and we are now in day two. So we'll see what happens [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=132.64000000000001s)]
*  after this lunch break. What is your sense, though? Obviously you're not in the room. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=136.88s)]
*  We don't know how these votes are going exactly. But what is your sense of how you believe [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=140.88s)]
*  the Church may go after Pope Francis in terms of its choice of a new pontiff? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=145.64s)]
*  Well, right, that's the big question. In terms of the electoral process, things are kind [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=150.76s)]
*  of going as you'd expect. We'd be very surprised if there was white smoke either last night [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=155.68s)]
*  or today. Now, possibly the end of today. Pope Francis was elected on the fifth ballot. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=160.0s)]
*  My guess is tomorrow. I think it might be a little more divided conclave. We heard during [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=166.48s)]
*  the general congregations, those discussions before the conclave, that there were disagreements [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=172.23999999999998s)]
*  about the direction of the Church. Some wanted to go very much with the Francis momentum. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=177.62s)]
*  Others felt this was problematic. One of the difficulties in talking about the Church is [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=182.23999999999998s)]
*  we tend to look at it through our Western lens. And so we have certain preoccupations, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=186.67999999999998s)]
*  Here's the wrong questions of sexual morality. But go to Africa, for instance, where the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=191.08s)]
*  Church is burgeoning, but also under great persecution. Go to the Church in Asia, and [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=196.28s)]
*  you see the inter-religious dialogue is of huge importance. So they're considering all [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=201.44s)]
*  these different dimensions of the Church's life. And there's something happening inside [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=205.58s)]
*  the walls of that Sistine Chapel right now. And we'll see. My sense is it might be a little [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=210.22000000000003s)]
*  last time. Also, I'd say, to speak politically, last time the more liberal faction was better [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=216.68s)]
*  organized. This time I know the conservatives were better organized going into the conclave. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=222.84s)]
*  That could lead to a little more of a deadlock. But we'll see. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=228.36s)]
*  So Bishop, talk to us, if you will, about the nature of the cardinals who were there [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=231.16s)]
*  in the Sistine Chapel in this conclave. As you say, certainly different factions, but [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=235.58s)]
*  also so many of them, this is the first time they've been through this. Pope Francis appointed [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=241.28s)]
*  so many new cardinals who are now potentially wanting to carry forth his legacies. So talk [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=245.24s)]
*  to us about these new cardinals, but also, as you say, so many of them are coming from [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=253.08s)]
*  parts of the world which have been underrepresented in previous conclaves. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=258.84000000000003s)]
*  That I think is the central dynamic of this conclave. So it is the most international [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=264.28000000000003s)]
*  for sure. But also people that have very little experience of Rome, many of them. That's why [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=268.08s)]
*  they extended the congregations for a couple of days. And that was at the behest, they [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=273.12s)]
*  say, of some of these more developing cardinals because they wanted to know each other better. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=277.20000000000005s)]
*  And they don't know the Romans scene as well. Now, depending on your perspective, that's [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=282.96000000000004s)]
*  good or bad. Could they be manipulated by those who do know the system better? Do they [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=286.84000000000003s)]
*  represent sort of a breath of fresh air into a somewhat musty system? So depending on your [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=291.76s)]
*  take, but I think it will certainly influence the movement of this conclave. We're moving [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=296.8s)]
*  away from a very Eurocentric or Western-oriented conclave to a much more global one. And I [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=302.28s)]
*  think with a lot of them, we don't really know what their views are. Francis seemed [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=308.47999999999996s)]
*  to prioritize getting people from diverse places on the map. But do they all share his [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=312.03999999999996s)]
*  perspective on everything? Some do. I'm not sure about others. So we'll see how that shakes [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=318.79999999999995s)]
*  out. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=324.32s)]
*  Bishop, I'm so glad, and I want to underline this for those of us that are viewing. So [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=325.11999999999995s)]
*  people in the West, so many people in America, so many people that follow this in the news, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=329.84s)]
*  they focus on one small set of issues. And you were talking about sexual morality, sexual [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=335.96s)]
*  issues, whether it's abortion, whether it's same sex marriage. But for most of the world, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=342.96s)]
*  especially in this, we keep talking about the South, they talk about that. But you're [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=351.12s)]
*  right. The focus is on religious persecution. It's on those Matthew 25 issues, where Jesus [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=356.88s)]
*  talks about feeding the poor, clothing the naked, bringing hope to the hopeless. Underline [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=362.84s)]
*  that fact for us and explain to Americans that are watching right now. This isn't just [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=368.56s)]
*  about what somebody's position on abortion is going to be or on same sex marriage. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=374.44s)]
*  Right. And that's the beautiful part of the Francis Papacy. I think they all want to carry [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=382.2s)]
*  forward. He wanted a church that turned with a merciful face toward the world, that was [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=387.4s)]
*  the friend of the marginalized, the friend of the poor and the forgotten. And I think [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=392.0s)]
*  that's the great legacy of Pope Francis. As far as I'm concerned, they all want that to [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=396.12s)]
*  continue. It's in regard to some other issues that I think they will find greater division. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=400.84s)]
*  But you know, conclaves often involve taking what they consider the best of the previous [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=405.48s)]
*  papacy and then maybe trying to correct difficulties in the previous papacy. And it's a playing [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=410.88s)]
*  out of those issues. There's also the question of the personalities involved. So one thing [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=416.32s)]
*  is the position the Cardinal holds. The other one is the Cardinal himself. What kind of [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=421.28s)]
*  person is he? Even his age, even his health, even your personal interactions with him. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=425.64s)]
*  Often at the general congregations, the Cardinal will say, that guy gave a speech or I just [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=432.6s)]
*  sensed something in him that I thought was worthy of a pope. So all those factors are at play, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=436.84s)]
*  as in any political reality. And this one on a very small scale, we got 133 electors and they're [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=442.59999999999997s)]
*  weighing all these different elements. It's amazing. Bishop Robert Barron, thank you so much for helping [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=449.96s)]
*  walk us through this all. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=456.91999999999996s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgmrAnRIoMk&t=466.84s)]
