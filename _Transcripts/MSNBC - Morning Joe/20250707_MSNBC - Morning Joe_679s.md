# ‘Going to crash the economy’: Joe slams spending bill, warns of coming impact
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [July 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A)
*  I think it'll have a huge impact on 2026 because remember as these changes, particularly the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=0.0s)]
*  Medicaid changes come into effect, people are going to be losing their coverage. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=5.86s)]
*  Longtime Republican strategist Carl Rove, when he was asked last week how he thinks [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=12.32s)]
*  the so-called one big beautiful bill will affect future elections, Rove went on to say [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=17.36s)]
*  Republican members need to go on the offense in order to defend the bill. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=23.04s)]
*  So the anchors referenced a Fox News poll showing 59% of Americans have a negative view [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=27.76s)]
*  of the legislation, which President Trump signed into law on Friday. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=33.74s)]
*  Steve Ratner will join us in a moment with charts on what the law means for Americans. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=38.88s)]
*  I want to bring in John Hyland though. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=43.92s)]
*  It's interesting here, John, and of course polls are just snapshots. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=46.88s)]
*  A lot of it depends on how do you sell things, how do you sell the polls politically. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=54.86s)]
*  It's interesting though that President Trump's two big successes that certainly the White [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=60.22s)]
*  House would consider success, the bombing of Iran's nuclear facilities and now the passage [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=66.02s)]
*  of this massive bill, both unpopular, the Iran bombing 56% in a poll I saw, the 58% [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=73.5s)]
*  oppose the bombing and of course we just talked about 59% opposing this bill. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=83.62s)]
*  Again, this all plays out over time. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=90.22s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=93.18s)]
*  It's certainly not where you want to start with either of these big policies, right? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=94.18s)]
*  Well, 100% obviously Joe and happy belated fourth. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=99.06s)]
*  Hope you and Mika have a good long weekend. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=103.54s)]
*  You guys get up to anything fun before we get into the serious business? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=105.5s)]
*  Hung out with my kids, so yeah, had a blast. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=109.38s)]
*  Kids, animals, dogs, cats, five animals. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=113.66s)]
*  Cats, no cows, no pigs this year. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=118.25999999999999s)]
*  That sounds perfect. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=123.66s)]
*  Here's the thing about the big beautiful bill. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=126.66s)]
*  I had a very, very quiet fourth weekend having been away for a little while before the fourth [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=133.34s)]
*  and had a very quiet one. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=140.22s)]
*  There was no fireworks anywhere nearby my house, which the dogs appreciated. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=141.34s)]
*  I know Mika, you know what that's like when the dogs are freaking out about the fireworks. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=146.22s)]
*  Here's the thing, Joe, about popularity and unpopularity. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=150.74s)]
*  Of course it's a moveable feast and of course it's going to change over time, particularly [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=155.54s)]
*  on the big bill, right? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=159.06s)]
*  You've got a bill that a lot of the provisions that are the most unpopular don't start kicking [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=161.06s)]
*  in until after the midterms, including all these big Medicaid cuts. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=167.78s)]
*  So the Democrats and our politics in general are going to have a space-time continuum problem, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=172.14000000000001s)]
*  right, where the impact of the bill is not going to be felt for quite some time. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=177.9s)]
*  That said though, that bill is the most unpopular piece of legislation in 35 years that's come [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=182.02s)]
*  out of Washington. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=189.1s)]
*  It's massively unpopular, but here's the other space-time continuum problem is that it's [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=190.5s)]
*  really unpopular among anybody who knows anything about it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=195.26s)]
*  As of right now, it's still the case that a lot of voters have no idea what's in the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=198.78s)]
*  bill. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=201.58s)]
*  So you have really this period, I think what Karl Roeva is kind of alluding to, implicit [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=202.58s)]
*  in the comments that you guys played, is that between now and the midterms of next year, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=207.18s)]
*  there's a lot of yardage and the news cycle moves really fast, but both sides think that [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=212.58s)]
*  this bill is going to be at the center of the debate next fall, not this fall, but next [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=218.76s)]
*  fall. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=223.51999999999998s)]
*  And so the battle to kind of define what was in this legislation, make people aware of [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=224.51999999999998s)]
*  what was in it, and then as it starts to hit people trying to make the case for and against [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=228.78s)]
*  it, for the Republican side and against the Democratic side, is going to be a really protracted, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=234.84s)]
*  complicated political dynamic. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=240.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, you know, the thing is, the Democrats have been so miserable in actually playing [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=243.28s)]
*  politics and being good at running campaigns and getting their message out there. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=249.92s)]
*  So there are no givens when it comes to the Democratic Party, which has a lower approval [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=256.0s)]
*  rating now than it's ever had. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=261.24s)]
*  I do wonder, though, if you're running for the House of Representatives. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=263.4s)]
*  Like I knew in 94, no Republican had been elected in my district since 1873. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=266.8s)]
*  I knew I had my opponent right where I wanted him. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=273.64s)]
*  If I were a Democrat running in 26, oh my gosh, I'd be sprinting out of the gate. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=279.04s)]
*  You've got tax cuts, biggest tax cuts ever for billionaires, tax cuts for multinational [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=286.0s)]
*  corporations, tax cuts for Silicon Valley monopolists, slashing spending for rural [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=294.23999999999995s)]
*  health care in red states, also in blue states. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=303.52s)]
*  You've got the largest deficits, the biggest federal debt ever, which is going to go up [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=308.52s)]
*  three and a half, four trillion dollars, and then twenty trillion dollars over the next [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=315.0s)]
*  decade, something that we didn't do as a country for like over 230 years. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=320.92s)]
*  They accumulate that much debt. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=326.2s)]
*  They're going to do it in one decade. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=328.52s)]
*  This was just reckless on all fronts. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=330.48s)]
*  I mean, you know, I just I do wonder if there's a, you know. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=332.4s)]
*  Well, I don't wonder, actually. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=337.08s)]
*  There's just no conservatives left in Washington, D.C. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=339.56s)]
*  There may be one or two. I'm dead serious. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=342.36s)]
*  There's not I can't think of a single person in my freshman class that came in in 94 that [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=345.20000000000005s)]
*  would have voted for this bill. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=352.48s)]
*  And we wouldn't have voted for this bill because we would have shut down the House before it [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=354.08000000000004s)]
*  even got to the floor. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=358.36s)]
*  This is just at least the way we framed being responsible with taxpayers dollars. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=360.20000000000005s)]
*  None of us, none of us would have allowed this out of committee. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=368.48s)]
*  This is unspeakably bad. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=372.48s)]
*  Whether you're talking about deficits, whether you're talking about the federal debt, whether [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=375.0s)]
*  you're talking about what we're doing, not to future generations of Americans, but to [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=379.32s)]
*  ourselves and to our children, to our grandchildren, we are going to be leaving them 10 years from [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=385.32s)]
*  now with over 50 trillion dollar federal debt. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=391.32s)]
*  That's just not sustainable. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=395.4s)]
*  It's going to crash the economy. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=396.92s)]
*  And the Republicans that voted for this know it. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=398.92s)]
*  Lisa Murkowski, who, quote, agonized over this, she knows it. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=402.04s)]
*  And she voted for crippling debt and deficits anyway. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=407.28s)]
*  Well, right. And voted for a bill that she said, I mean, I'm not sure I've ever really [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=413.24s)]
*  heard anything quite like what Lisa Murkowski said when she said essentially, I don't like [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=416.64s)]
*  this bill. I know it's going to hurt the country. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=420.32s)]
*  I got a little bit of sweetener here from my state, which is my job as someone who represents [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=423.16s)]
*  Alaska. But I know this is a bad bill. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=428.16s)]
*  I'm really hoping the House will fix it. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=430.24s)]
*  An incredible thing for United States Senator to say, regardless of what party you're in or [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=432.28000000000003s)]
*  what ideology you to. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=436.88000000000005s)]
*  But, Joe, here's the thing that I even was even more striking to me. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=438.64000000000004s)]
*  There were people if you talk about your congressional experience here in the House of [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=441.76000000000005s)]
*  Representatives, there were both hardline, hardline people on the right and and [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=446.64000000000004s)]
*  moderates or let's call them establishment Republicans who, after the Senate bill got [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=453.08000000000004s)]
*  passed, the Senate version got passed, who stood up and said for 12 hours, 24 [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=458.56s)]
*  hours said, we can never support this bill without changes. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=464.32s)]
*  We must have changes. And they had their various changes. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=468.16s)]
*  This is what I understand. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=471.2s)]
*  How do you do this as a conservative? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=472.68s)]
*  How do you say we're never going to vote for this bill? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=475.4s)]
*  And then you collapse. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=479.16s)]
*  Then you fold. I don't understand it. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=480.64s)]
*  We didn't know. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=483.12s)]
*  It's why we balance the budget four years in a row. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=484.24s)]
*  But these people that are in the, quote, freedom caucus, they all folded and they all [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=486.96000000000004s)]
*  added three and a half to four trillion dollars onto America's national debt. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=494.20000000000005s)]
*  They did it. They were responsible. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=499.44000000000005s)]
*  They can never say they're conservative again. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=502.36s)]
*  They can never say they give a damn about deficits or the federal debt again because [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=504.52000000000004s)]
*  they don't. And look, the moderates were just as bad, Joe. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=508.92s)]
*  They were bad on both sides. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=513.6s)]
*  And here's the thing that's stunning to me, though, is that is that generally when you [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=515.28s)]
*  stand up in the House of Representatives or in the Senate and say, I will never support [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=519.48s)]
*  this bill without changes, often the changes end up being cosmetic. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=523.1999999999999s)]
*  They end up not being real important changes. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=527.72s)]
*  But the president throws you a bone somehow. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=530.0s)]

*  stood up and said, I will never support the Senate version of the bill unless it changes. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=556.7199999999999s)]
*  And then two days later, support the Senate bill as written and as passed. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvK-F4ZX20A&t=561.4799999999999s)]
