# 'Bone-chilling to Putin': Senators push tough new Russia sanctions
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM)
*  Well, let's bring in on this subject Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=0.0s)]
*  He is a member of the armed services and also of the Judiciary Committee. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=4.48s)]
*  Senator, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=7.76s)]
*  There is a lot we want to get to you with you this morning, but let's start with that [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=10.32s)]
*  conversation we were just having. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=13.32s)]
*  We had a Texas judge yesterday, actually somebody who'd been appointed by the Trump administration, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=14.8s)]
*  who rejected the White House's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  saying that the definition of invasion, he'd gone back to the dictionaries, he'd gone back [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=24.6s)]
*  to history, and there is no invasion to justify the use of that act. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=28.48s)]
*  Do you think we are, because of the polls, because of the stories starting to come out, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=33.08s)]
*  because it has taken a little bit of time to get all of the news behind this, do you [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=38.32s)]
*  think we might be at a turning point where the courts are in a clear and serious way [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=42.36s)]
*  going to corral and limit what the White House can do on this? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=48.32s)]
*  I think we are at a turning point, and thank you for having me and raising this issue right [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=54.839999999999996s)]
*  away because as someone who has spent most of my career as a prosecutor, a law enforcer, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=61.04s)]
*  as a trial lawyer, I believe so deeply in due process, and I think the courts have really [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=69.84s)]
*  been offended in some way by the administration's, in effect, defiance of due process and the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=76.16s)]
*  rule of law, saying that they will refuse to obey a court order. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=84.88s)]
*  Judges disagree about a lot, but what binds them together is a very strong feeling that [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=90.16s)]
*  litigants should not be contemptuous of lawful orders, and the threat of it, I think, is [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=97.88s)]
*  in fact producing greater awareness on the part of the judiciary that this constitutional [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=104.76s)]
*  crisis has reached a point where they need to, in effect, say to the administration, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=109.8s)]
*  you can't simply defy the law and assert that the executive branch prevails, even though [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=116.96s)]
*  the judiciary has no police or armies, its orders have to be obeyed. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=124.72s)]
*  So you would not put yourself in that camp of some constitutional lawyers who are saying, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=129.72s)]
*  look, what we need to see is a very clear ruling from the Supreme Court that the White [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=135.16s)]
*  House then overrules or ignores in order to be able to say that we are in that phrase [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=140.68s)]
*  constitutional crisis, which is being used a lot in Washington at the moment? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=148.68s)]
*  I think we're likely to see that kind of order from the Supreme Court, either on birthright [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=154.16s)]
*  citizenship or some other ruling relating to deportations or some other issue where [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=158.88000000000002s)]
*  the administration, in effect, has taken the law into its own hands. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=167.88000000000002s)]
*  I think the Roberts Court, particularly the most recent Republican nominees, I wouldn't [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=171.60000000000002s)]
*  put Thomas or Alito in that category, but I think we're likely to see a 7-2 ruling, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=178.0s)]
*  in effect, saying to the administration, you're going too far, you're crossing the line, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=183.96s)]
*  you need to obey court orders. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=189.2s)]
*  I think that kind of ruling will come. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=192.68s)]
*  And absolutely, the American people, you know, I see it every day, believe that dangerous [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=195.32s)]
*  criminals who are in this country without documentation should be deported, but there [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=203.44s)]
*  should be due process. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=209.8s)]
*  Senator, good morning. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=211.51999999999998s)]
*  Let's turn to the war in Ukraine. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=212.95999999999998s)]
*  You and your Republican colleagues, Senator Lindsey Graham, put forth a few weeks ago [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=215.51999999999998s)]
*  a bill that would have primary and secondary sanctions against Russia and countries that [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=219.35999999999999s)]
*  support its energy industry if there's no ceasefire coming. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=223.79999999999998s)]
*  We heard from President Trump in recent days a little bit of anger at Russia. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=228.95999999999998s)]
*  Some White House aides, I've been told, Treasury officials, looking at possible sanctions, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=232.73999999999998s)]
*  but there's simply no sense whether or not they'll ever be imposed. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=236.83999999999997s)]
*  So let's get you a read there as to why the necessity for this. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=240.14s)]
*  And do you have any faith that President Trump, for once, will stand up to President Putin [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=243.89999999999998s)]
*  of Russia? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=247.77999999999997s)]
*  I have faith that the United States Congress will pass this bipartisan Russia sanctions [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=250.77999999999997s)]
*  bill. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=256.65999999999997s)]
*  We now have more than 70 co-sponsors, pretty much evenly divided, Republican, Democrat, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=257.65999999999997s)]
*  including the Republican leader, Senator Thune, majority leader, and the Democratic leader, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=264.82s)]
*  Senator Schumer, the chairman and ranking members of the Armed Services Committee and [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=271.7s)]
*  the Foreign Relations Committee. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=276.26s)]
*  This kind of support should send a very chilling message to Vladimir Putin that the Congress [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=278.42s)]
*  is supporting Ukraine and he should quit stalling and stringing along the president. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=286.98s)]
*  Donald Trump has called it tapping him along. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=294.70000000000005s)]
*  He made reference to these kinds of sanctions. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=297.02000000000004s)]
*  But this sanctions bill would impose 500 percent tariffs on products from any country, like [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=300.66s)]
*  China or India, that buys Russian oil, natural gas, and other products. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=310.82s)]
*  That would put Russia on an economic island, completely isolated. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=319.14s)]
*  And so an already reeling and floundering Russian economy would be hit really hard. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=324.02s)]
*  hope is that it will, in effect, compel Putin to come to the bargaining table and that Trump [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=333.68s)]
*  will stand up to him and say Russia has to accede to security guarantees and that the [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=341.96s)]
*  United States will provide those security guarantees a backstop. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=350.0s)]
*  Europe is on board with this legislation. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=354.32s)]
*  We've met with the embassies of the UK, Germany, France and others. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=357.44s)]
*  And I think we're presenting a united front that could persuade Putin to seriously negotiate [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=365.0s)]
*  and quit tapping along, as Donald Trump has put it, the United States. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=371.52s)]
*  Senator, briefly, though, do you believe there's an appetite at the top of this administration, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=376.32s)]
*  namely from the president himself, to levy further sanctions on Vladimir Putin, somebody [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=381.48s)]
*  he has favored in these negotiations? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=386.38s)]
*  I think there's an appetite in some parts of the administration to be tougher. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=392.46s)]
*  And I think that this message is really going to be bone chilling to Vladimir Putin, that [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=397.98s)]
*  he would be put on this island. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=404.74s)]
*  I think that Donald Trump has to understand that the American security interest is at [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=406.5s)]
*  stake in Ukraine because Putin will keep going if he has not stopped there. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=415.78000000000003s)]
*  And Ukraine has valiantly and strongly resisted the murderous assault from Russia. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=421.5s)]
*  And these sanctions would be invoked not only if Russia fails to come to the table and negotiate [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=429.58s)]
*  seriously, but also if it breaks the agreement and if it invades Ukraine again. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=436.90000000000003s)]
*  So we want more than just a temporary ceasefire. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=442.78s)]
*  There has to be a peace agreement that is fair to Ukraine, provides some return, perhaps [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=445.78s)]
*  of its territory, but most important, security guarantees, and even a potential path toward [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=451.53999999999996s)]
*  EU membership and NATO. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=459.41999999999996s)]
*  It is bipartisan legislation that would impose 500 percent tariffs, as the senator said. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=462.97999999999996s)]
*  We'll see where it heads from here. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=467.73999999999995s)]
*  Thanks, Senator. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=469.34s)]
*  Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=470.34s)]
*  Senator, thanks so much. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHqY_C2lLM&t=471.9s)]
