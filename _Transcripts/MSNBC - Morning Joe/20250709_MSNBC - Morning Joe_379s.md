# 'They've lost everything': Salvation Army major on helping those in Texas
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw)
*  And as rescue crews continue their search for the scores of people still missing across [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=0.0s)]
*  central Texas, the Salvation Army is on the ground providing critical support for the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=5.92s)]
*  first responders and the many residents displaced by the devastation. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  Joining us now is Phil Swires, who is a major with the Salvation Army in Texas. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=16.4s)]
*  And Mike Barnicle, you have the first question. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=22.0s)]
*  Major Swires, this event in Texas has gripped the nation and perhaps even the world. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=24.84s)]
*  And I think part of the reason it has, obviously the loss of life is tremendous and loss of [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=31.08s)]
*  families is tremendous, but the idea that so many children, children, young children, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=37.72s)]
*  were literally swept away by a raging tide of rivers and are still missing and presumed to be [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=44.36s)]
*  dead. I'm wondering what impact does that have on the wonderful work that your people are doing [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=51.48s)]
*  right now in Texas, mentally the burden of knowing what they're doing and surrounded by so much death [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=57.239999999999995s)]
*  and especially the death of children. What impact does that have on the work you're doing? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=64.6s)]
*  Well, first thank you for allowing me to be here. You know, parents aren't supposed to be [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=71.16s)]
*  burying their children and so it is a devastating, tragic loss. And the fact that there's so many, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=79.88s)]
*  I mean, as a kid for me, you know, I went to camps and it's a beautiful area for children to [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=86.36s)]
*  go to camp for summer. You know, you're enjoying, you know, the weeks that you're there and then this [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=92.67999999999999s)]
*  unthinkable thing takes place. The Salvation Army, we have feeding kitchens that go around and feed [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=99.96s)]
*  and attach to each one of those is someone that is there just as we're providing those services, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=107.4s)]
*  you know, just to look at the individuals that were there to have conversation with them and to [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=115.72s)]
*  try to recognize if this needs something further. And so as a part of our services that are there, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=121.16000000000001s)]
*  we have people who are on each vehicle that are going out to serve. And so it is devastating. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=128.6s)]
*  You know, it's long hours but you go home at night and at the end of the day you have a house and [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=137.88s)]
*  I've got kids that greet me and I just as a parent can't imagine, I can't imagine what they're going [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=143.48000000000002s)]
*  through each and every day since those loss. But you're right, the loss of kids, especially so many, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=152.44s)]
*  is unthinkable. Mr. Swire, at the same time that you deal with the gravity of dealing with the loss [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=163.0s)]
*  of life, especially children, does it not also say to many that work with you in the Salvation Army [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=173.24s)]
*  that it really gives you a real self-definition of why you do this work and why it's important [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=180.6s)]
*  that you do what you do and not do something that you could have made a lot more money at or [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=187.72s)]
*  something else. But when you look at the fact that you're looking at people that had no other means [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=192.28s)]
*  of help or empathy or support than you, it really gives a boost to that you are on a mission that you [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=199.24s)]
*  really are needed in. It does and I appreciate that. Disasters hit whoever is affected by that [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=207.24s)]
*  disaster and so with that it's those who have and those who have not and certainly [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=219.96s)]
*  we see this and this disaster along these banks. You have people who were going there for [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=228.28s)]
*  4th of July festivities and then you had people who lived their entire life just to have a place [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=235.0s)]
*  on the river and enjoy it in retirement. I wake up every day and it's hard to believe I get to do [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=242.04s)]
*  this. I love the work of the Salvation Army. I love being able to help everybody without [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=249.08s)]
*  discrimination who is in need and I love to see community people. If people were able to see our [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=255.64s)]
*  parking lot and the number of volunteers who in this tragedy have come to the Salvation Army to [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=262.6s)]
*  sort through so many bags that have been donated and our goal is to get through everything that's [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=267.96000000000004s)]
*  done for that day processed and ready to go so that when we're able to help individuals affected [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=274.36s)]
*  with this to get back on their feet with so much. They've lost everything. It's not just [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=283.32000000000005s)]
*  rent and utilities. There's kitchen appliances that are needed. It's sheets, towels. It's [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=292.28s)]
*  unthinkable to think of how much people have lost and are in need of this and on top of that then [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=300.91999999999996s)]
*  the emotional trauma that people have with the loss of children but I love what I do and I [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=308.84s)]
*  wouldn't want to do anything else. I believe I'm held in God's palm and called to serve those that [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=315.4s)]
*  need it most. Well we are so grateful for what you do. I don't know if we can put that number [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=325.56s)]
*  up again as we thank Major with the Salvation Army in Texas, Phil Swires. It's really, really [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=332.35999999999996s)]
*  almost impossible to put into words the devastation but you have certainly tried [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=340.44s)]
*  here and we appreciate it so much. We do. Thank you so much for coming on the show. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=345.71999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. God bless you. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=351.4s)]
*  you [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4bpl4DOqw&t=369.88s)]
