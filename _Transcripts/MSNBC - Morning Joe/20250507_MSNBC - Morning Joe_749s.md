# 'A leader doesn't get triggered': Mika on Mark Carney telling Trump 'No'
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4)
*  President Trump made those comments about not needing trade deals during a meeting with [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=0.0s)]
*  Canada's new prime minister. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=4.8s)]
*  Mark Carney arrived at the White House yesterday where he and the president discussed tariffs, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=7.2s)]
*  as well as Trump's push to annex Canada. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=12.56s)]
*  Mr. President, you have said that Canada should become the 51st state. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=14.88s)]
*  No, no. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=20.64s)]
*  Well, I still believe that, but you know, it takes two to tango, right? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=21.64s)]
*  But no, I do. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=25.76s)]
*  I mean, I believe it would be a massive tax cut for the Canadian citizens. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=27.279999999999998s)]
*  You get free military, you get tremendous medical cares and other things. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=31.84s)]
*  There would be a lot of advantages. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=37.84s)]
*  Well, if I may, as you know, from real estate, there are some places that are never for sale. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=41.04s)]
*  That's true. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=48.08s)]
*  We're sitting in one right now, you know, Buckingham Palace that you visited as well. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=48.64s)]
*  That's true. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=52.4s)]
*  And having met with the owners of Canada over the course of the campaign last several months, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=53.44s)]
*  it's not for sale, it won't be for sale ever. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=59.92s)]
*  But the opportunity is in the partnership and what we can build together. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=62.96s)]
*  And we have done that in the past. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=68.0s)]
*  They have, I must say, Canada is stepping up the military participation because [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=69.44s)]
*  Mark knew, you know, they were low and now they're stepping it up. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=77.2s)]
*  And that's a very important thing. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=79.68s)]
*  But never say never, never say never. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=81.12s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=83.44s)]
*  Is there anything he can say to you in the course of your meetings with him today that [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=84.72s)]
*  gets you to lift tariffs on Canada? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=88.63999999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=91.44s)]
*  Why not? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=92.08s)]
*  Just the way it is. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=93.19999999999999s)]
*  See, the conflict is and this is very friendly. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=94.63999999999999s)]
*  This is not going to be like we had another little blow up with somebody else. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  That was a much different. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=103.11999999999999s)]
*  This is a very friendly conversation. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  But we want to make our own cars. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=107.28s)]
*  We don't really want cars from Canada. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=109.83999999999999s)]
*  And we put tariffs on cars from Canada. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=112.47999999999999s)]
*  And at a certain point, it won't make economic sense for Canada to build those cars. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=116.0s)]
*  So, J. Mark, I think this meeting that happened at the White House, absolutely fascinating. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  There is, you know what, nothing triggering about it because Mark Carney, Trump's equal, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=129.2s)]
*  some would argue even more so, knows how to handle situations like this. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=135.92s)]
*  Being in the finance industry, being extremely well versed in leadership. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=140.32s)]
*  A leader doesn't get triggered. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=146.64s)]
*  A leader doesn't get meltdown at a comment he doesn't like. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=148.72s)]
*  There were many comments there that Donald Trump was making that Mark Carney, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=152.32s)]
*  100 percent, wholeheartedly disagrees with and knows will never happen. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=156.56s)]
*  He did not embarrass the president. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=161.6s)]
*  At the same time, he very calmly and affably said no. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=163.44s)]
*  He brought a well-conceived, precooked, but well-delivered line with him, Mika, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=170.79999999999998s)]
*  which is, as you know, from real estate, Mr. President, playing on the president's history. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=176.72s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=181.2s)]
*  And said some places are never for sale, including this building we're in right now. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=182.16s)]
*  Which, by the way, Trump rarely laughs. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=187.04s)]
*  And he even chuckled at that, which tells you it was a pretty good line. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=189.44s)]
*  So, look, I thought Carney did what he had to do. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=194.24s)]
*  He was firm in saying Canada is not for sale. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=196.72s)]
*  He invoked the voters of his country. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=198.64s)]
*  He just elected him as the de facto board of directors, saying his country is not for sale. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=200.23999999999998s)]
*  But, Mika, this is classic Trump. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=205.76s)]
*  You guys know this. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=208.55999999999997s)]
*  In person, when Trump is face-to-face with somebody, he wants to win them over. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=209.51999999999998s)]
*  He's not going to have a confrontation with Carney in the Oval Office. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=214.79999999999998s)]
*  He wants Carney to be his friend. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=218.16s)]
*  And that's why it was so affable, because Trump is never going to get into a tit for [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=220.39999999999998s)]
*  tat with somebody. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=224.56s)]
*  Almost never. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=226.0s)]
*  I think it's a different case with Oslensky. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=226.8s)]
*  But Trump in person is constantly—it could be Gavin Newsom, Vladimir Putin, or Mark Carney. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=230.48000000000002s)]
*  He wants to win that person over. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=237.04000000000002s)]
*  And that's the Trump that you saw yesterday with Mark Carney in the Oval Office. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=239.20000000000002s)]
*  And Carney, to his credit, didn't give Trump a reason not to try to persuade him. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=243.44s)]
*  I personally—Willie, I guess you can take it to meet him. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=249.76000000000002s)]
*  But I think there's a lot of lessons there for Republicans. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=255.51999999999998s)]
*  Things don't have to be so obsequious. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=261.12s)]
*  When there's a no, you ought to say it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=264.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, and John Meacham, we've seen that periodically. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=267.76s)]
*  I was thinking about Governor Brian Kemp of Georgia announcing he's not getting in [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=270.8s)]
*  that Senate race. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=274.48s)]
*  His conservative credentials remain intact. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=276.0s)]
*  But during that 2020 election, he and the Secretary of State there did stand up in [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=278.48s)]
*  that moment against Donald Trump as he tried to flip that election. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=283.2s)]
*  So it can be done. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=286.24s)]
*  But I'm just curious, historically, just watching these meetings are so fascinating [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=287.12s)]
*  always in the Oval Office. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=292.0s)]
*  The two men in those two chairs with the fireplace behind them. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=293.2s)]
*  Even President Trump invoked that meeting with President Zelensky a few months ago. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=296.56s)]
*  What did you make of this new relationship that we're seeing and the pushback, honestly, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=301.44s)]
*  in that way that Mika described with a light touch from the Prime Minister of Canada? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=306.32s)]
*  Well, the Oval Office is probably one of the worst places on the planet to have an honest [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=310.24s)]
*  conversation. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=317.44s)]
*  You're in that room. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=321.52s)]
*  I've been privileged to be there. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=323.6s)]
*  I know most of us have had that great opportunity. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=325.52s)]
*  And if you're a dork, which I am, I know that'd be surprising to Mika, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=331.04s)]
*  you walk in there and you're smelling FDR, FDR secondhand smoke, and you can feel [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=338.08s)]
*  President Reagan nodding his head. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=346.71999999999997s)]
*  It's just great. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=349.52s)]
*  It's a room that is more of a stage than a negotiating space. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=351.68s)]
*  And I think that there's a kind of [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=358.56s)]
*  unreality that takes over. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=362.0s)]
*  First, A, take the Oval Office itself and the immense history and the sense that you want to [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=367.92s)]
*  be deferential. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=375.84000000000003s)]
*  Add the TV cameras and we're way past where the buses run, as my grandmother used to say. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=377.6s)]
*  And so it's a very complicated space. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=384.56s)]
*  It's why the Zelensky conversation, which is a big to be sure, J-Mart, in terms of moments [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=389.28s)]
*  within that office, looms so large. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=398.32s)]
*  Because when you're in that room, you want, as you all were just saying, you want this to be [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=402.64s)]
*  congenial, historical, dignified. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=410.0s)]
*  When it isn't, it's remarkable. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=413.03999999999996s)]
*  Which is why the president's essential contempt, I use that word advisedly, but the apparent [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=416.0s)]
*  contempt he had for Ukraine, has for Ukraine, was so vivid. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=422.64000000000004s)]
*  And so I think that what we're watching here is an unconventional American president, to say the [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=427.84000000000003s)]
*  least, deploying the symbols of the office in this highly personalized, highly dramatic way. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=433.84000000000003s)]
*  Remember, early on in the first term, President Trump was quoted as saying he wanted every day of [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=446.16s)]
*  his presidency to be like the episode in a reality show, where he vanquished his foes. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=452.64000000000004s)]
*  And that's the world we're living in. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=458.64000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. Two things. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=462.08000000000004s)]
*  I would say the Zelensky meeting, President Trump brought others in and it was more like a gang up. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=463.52000000000004s)]
*  And the dynamics were very different, obviously. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=470.72s)]
*  And then in terms of the smell of the Oval Office and the sense of history, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=474.4s)]
*  have you been in the Oval Office lately? It's been redecorated just a tiny bit. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=478.79999999999995s)]
*  Just saying. It might not have that same feeling. Could be. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=483.44s)]
*  It will surprise you that I have not been there recently. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=489.59999999999997s)]
*  Though I know what you mean. But it's still a remarkable space. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=493.84s)]
*  I'm joking. I'm joking. It's beautiful. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=500.0s)]
*  OK, so the editors of the National Review have a new piece, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=502.08s)]
*  J. Martin, titled Trump's Anti-Abundance Agenda. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=505.35999999999996s)]
*  And it reads in part this, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=509.03999999999996s)]
*  bizarrely the man who for decades has been a symbol of unapologetic American success is now [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=510.15999999999997s)]
*  defending his tariff policies, excess, is now defending his tariff policies by making a case [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=516.4s)]
*  against abundance. It's hard to think of a greater gift to Democrats during a chaotic and expensive [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=523.76s)]
*  Christmas shopping season than footage of Trump, who never faced the prospect of either a child [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=530.32s)]
*  or a parent of having to make do with less, yammering about American children being so [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=539.6s)]
*  spoiled. It would be one thing if there were reason to believe that the short-term sacrifices [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=546.0s)]
*  Trump is asking of the American public were accompanied by a plausible path toward a payoff [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=551.2800000000001s)]
*  somewhere in the future, near future. But unless Trump backs off or his unilateral [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=558.88s)]
*  assumption of tariff power is blocked by Congress or the courts, Americans will suffer real pain. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=564.8000000000001s)]
*  Dismissing the legitimate economic concerns of American consumers has never been a winning [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=572.88s)]
*  political strategy. And Jonathan Martin, that is, I mean, every conversation we've ever had [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=578.8000000000001s)]
*  and every election we have covered has come back to, yeah, this is going on and that's going on, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=585.52s)]
*  but it's about Americans' day-to-day concerns, kitchen table issues. How much does the car [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=593.1999999999999s)]
*  insurance cost? How much does gas cost? How much do their groceries cost? It comes down to their life. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=600.0s)]
*  And Trump just ran a campaign which was not based upon, you know, austerity. Trump never said during [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=606.96s)]
*  the campaign, you know, the good times are going to roll after a few years of sacrifice and less [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=612.24s)]
*  gifts for your kids for Christmas and some real pain. No, the pledge of the campaign was like, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=618.88s)]
*  we're going to rock and roll America's golden ages here. So there's a bit of a rug pull if you will. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=624.72s)]
*  Yeah, so what happened to that? So I think that aside, look, I think take your medicine is just [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=632.32s)]
*  never a good message for the American voter. They don't want to hear it. And I think the idea that [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=638.08s)]
*  American voters are going to be willing to pay more for goods. Boy, if you believe that, I got news [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=643.5200000000001s)]
*  for you. We just had an administration that got rejected, I think in large part because of [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=649.5200000000001s)]
*  inflation. So I'm skeptical that voters are willing to accept that. And just real fast to come back to [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=655.0400000000001s)]
*  the first clip you played of Trump yesterday in the Oval saying that people want to be in our [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=660.88s)]
*  market. We don't want to be selling goods in their markets. That is such a profound misread [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=665.6s)]
*  of the economy of this country. Trump should go to fly over country, talk to farmers in ag states. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=671.76s)]
*  Where does he think we send our goods that we grow here in this country? It's not all for the [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=679.28s)]
*  American consumers. So this is a real challenge we're going to face. And I think the markets are [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=684.4s)]
*  mostly looking for good news and best is going to China. And the markets are responding to that. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=689.84s)]
*  But this is the great question. Who is actually going to set policy for the administration? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=695.04s)]
*  Donald Trump and his off the cuff rhetoric or the folks like Scott Besson who are actually doing [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=699.36s)]
*  policy negotiations with the Chinese? It's unclear to me. Democrats are going to be asking golden [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=705.5999999999999s)]
*  age for who? Not for you. I mean, this is only a golden age, I guess, for people who are billionaires [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=712.16s)]
*  and Trump and his family. Politics Bureau chief and senior political columnist for Politico. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=720.48s)]
*  Jonathan Martin, thank you so much for being on this morning. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoieCg0rr4&t=726.24s)]
