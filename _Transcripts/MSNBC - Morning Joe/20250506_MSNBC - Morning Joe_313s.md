# Newark travel chaos kicked off when air traffic control lost communication with aircraft
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4)
*  Alright, let's get to the news. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=0.0s)]
*  Our top story this morning, this morning we continue to see massive travel disruptions [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=2.92s)]
*  at one of the nation's busiest airports and we're getting new information about what initially [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=7.4s)]
*  caused the delays and cancellations. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  We've learned at one point last week, air traffic controllers temporarily lost communication [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=15.44s)]
*  with planes flying in and out of Newark International Airport. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=21.46s)]
*  Is that bad? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=24.92s)]
*  That's not good. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=25.96s)]
*  No. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=26.96s)]
*  Air traffic controllers function with federal aviation administration equipment and air [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=27.96s)]
*  traffic controllers were unable to see, hear or talk with any aircraft. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=32.36s)]
*  It's not clear how long communication was lost but because of that incident, several [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=39.56s)]
*  air traffic controllers went on leave. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=45.28s)]
*  New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy sent a letter to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy yesterday [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=48.84s)]
*  asking for technology upgrades at Newark Airport. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=54.6s)]
*  You know Willie, this is something, Steve Ratner has been complaining for years that [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  we have antiquated systems, FAA has antiquated systems. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=63.32s)]
*  Things were bad before COVID, things have gotten so much worse even after COVID. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=68.3s)]
*  A lot of people getting out as air traffic controllers, taking early retirement. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=73.4s)]
*  You've got a retirement age of 56 which makes absolutely no sense. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=78.64s)]
*  If I could trust myself at my age now then I would have at 56 or 46 or 36. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=82.72s)]
*  I mean people into their 60s, early 60s, mid 60s should be able to be doing this. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=88.24s)]
*  I mean they've really got to take another look at this. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=92.8s)]
*  It's not like 1955. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=96.44s)]
*  They need to keep the best and the brightest in there for as long as they can. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=99.52s)]
*  Well I mean you hear the details of that story. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=103.0s)]
*  We are very lucky there was no catastrophe. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=104.84s)]
*  Air tragedy, when you lose communication with all the traffic coming in and out of a New [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=107.56s)]
*  York area airport that's just staggering and they need to walk out which has further made [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=111.88000000000001s)]
*  the problems even worse. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=117.2s)]
*  They walked out of the FAA, the air traffic controllers because of this saying hey we're [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=118.4s)]
*  going to make a statement here, we need to change something because this is not working. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal is actually writing about this this morning. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=127.0s)]
*  America's air traffic fiasco. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=130.28s)]
*  This comes from the editorial board writing, President Trump wants to reorder the global [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=132.0s)]
*  trading system. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=136.04000000000002s)]
*  How about fixing America's air traffic mess? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=137.42000000000002s)]
*  The US in 2003 directed the FAA to modernize its systems yet the next gen overhaul is not [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=140.6s)]
*  set to be complete until 2030. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=146.6s)]
*  As transportation secretary Sean Duffy notes the FAA still uses floppy disks. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=149.44s)]
*  Does Gen Z even know what those are? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=154.44s)]
*  Few technicians can even repair its aging system, some of which are more than 60 years [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=156.64s)]
*  old. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=161.4s)]
*  The best reform would be if the US followed Canada and other nations and turned air traffic [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=162.4s)]
*  over to a private non-profit. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=167.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, get ready for another summer of air traffic delays are worse and I think we've [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=168.95999999999998s)]
*  all heard this. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=173.79999999999998s)]
*  You're sitting at a gate somewhere and you go weather looks good, weather's good where [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=175.23999999999998s)]
*  I'm going, what's going on and I heard this just a couple of months ago at one airport [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=179.72s)]
*  where they said we actually have to fly to Denver first, get to a hub and wait until [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=183.88s)]
*  newer clears because of all the chaos there. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=188.92s)]
*  Yeah and this has happened Mike summer after summer since COVID. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=191.51999999999998s)]
*  A couple of years ago was especially bad. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=195.48s)]
*  I know Pete Buttigieg was constantly going to airports and coming on television trying [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=197.88000000000002s)]
*  to explain what was going on. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=202.64000000000001s)]
*  Here we are 2025. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=204.28s)]
*  The situation seems to be going from bad to worse. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=206.12s)]
*  This looks like a terrible launch for a travel summer for millions and millions of Americans [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=209.36s)]
*  and a summer that appears to be the least safe in some time. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=214.3s)]
*  So but we accept it as passengers. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=219.8s)]
*  We accept that we go to the airport. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=222.44s)]
*  There's going to be a delay in our flight. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=223.96s)]
*  We're going to sit on the runway yesterday because of the Newark situation and it all [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=226.36s)]
*  starts in Philadelphia with the lack of FAA control or whatever. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=230.84s)]
*  We sat on the runway for an hour and a half to two hours. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=235.44s)]
*  We take off. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=238.28s)]
*  We're coming to New York. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=239.28s)]
*  It's very rainy and cloudy out obviously on the ground. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=240.48s)]
*  We're coming in for a landing, planes coming in and all of a sudden zoom we swoop upwards. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=244.08s)]
*  The pilot comes on the air and says you know sorry about that. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=249.8s)]
*  The runway is a little overcrowded. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=253.76s)]
*  We're going to take another round and take it run at it again. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=255.48s)]
*  And that happens too often. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=258.52s)]
*  And it's a miracle that something really truly tragic and horrific has not happened especially [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=261.44s)]
*  on the east coast of America. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=267.4s)]
*  All of these airports in such a small geographical area and FAA traffic control problems. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=269.76s)]
*  Please let's go. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=275.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=276.56s)]
*  I mean they've got to do something. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=277.56s)]
*  I mean they're using floppy disks right now. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=278.92s)]
*  You've got systems that are so old, 60 years old. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=281.76s)]
*  I mean come on. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=285.68s)]
*  We can't wait until 2030. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=289.56s)]
*  We've got to get it now. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=290.56s)]
*  It's scary. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=291.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E87oj9S8-L4&t=292.56s)]
