# “We’re going to see more chaos”: Former NSA Jake Sullivan on Trump’s Waltz/Rubio shakeup
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo)
*  We're gonna right now former national security advisor under President Biden Jake Sullivan Jake [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=0.0s)]
*  Not much to talk about right? So but thank you for dropping by anyway. Thank you for having me [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=5.04s)]
*  All right. So anyway, uh marco rubio has taken over uh your your old position. I'm curious [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=9.6s)]
*  For either the secretary of state [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=17.36s)]
*  Or the next person that steps into that position. What what advice would you pass along? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=21.68s)]
*  Well, the first thing I would say is that I spent four years as national security advisor and [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=27.68s)]
*  I'm not one of those days that I say hey, I've got some spare time to be secretary of state as well [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=32.0s)]
*  So I think trying to do both jobs at once maybe that worked back in kissinger's era 50 years ago [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=36.56s)]
*  But we have a competitive work by the way, henry kissinger was the only person who said it worked even 50 years ago [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=41.6s)]
*  But go ahead [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  A big emphasis on maybe maybe it works. Okay, right [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=48.64s)]
*  We have a very competitive world out there and we need a full team on the field [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=52.4s)]
*  So we need somebody in that national security advisor job [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=55.84s)]
*  Frankly who has the trust of the president right also who can step up and deal with this array of challenges and you know [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=59.84s)]
*  I do feel [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=65.84s)]
*  A certain amount of sympathy for mike waltz because one of the things about what's just happened [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=67.04s)]
*  It shows being national security advisor is a tough job. It's a hot seat and [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=72.16s)]
*  You it's thankless in a lot of ways and mike waltz has learned that the hard way [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=76.56s)]
*  Yeah, you know [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=81.12s)]
*  I talked to I talked to a lot of foreign leaders a lot of [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=82.64s)]
*  a lot of diplomats over your your four years when you're a national security advisor and the conversation would always move to [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=86.56s)]
*  You know [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=94.88000000000001s)]
*  How how's jake sell how what's it like to work with jake sullivan? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=95.84s)]
*  What's it like to work with with the secretary of state blink and what's it like to work and i'd go down the list [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=99.2s)]
*  and um, and it's very interesting they had [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=105.76s)]
*  Very different [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=109.67999999999999s)]
*  very positive views of what you did [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=111.11999999999999s)]
*  And what tony blinken did and what? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=114.24s)]
*  general also did [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  But as you're saying [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=119.52s)]
*  They were completely different silos who all work together [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=121.28s)]
*  But they knew to call you for specific things they knew to call tony for specific things [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=125.11999999999999s)]
*  They knew to call the general for for specific things. I just like you said I [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=129.6s)]
*  It just seems like it's way too much to have one person doing both of these jobs [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, you know another feature of this is [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=140.08s)]
*  The president sets the policy and the policy that he said is basically [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=143.28s)]
*  Let's go declare war on all of our friends on our all of our allies in the world part of the reason you heard positive [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=146.96s)]
*  Feedback going around the world before was we spent four years building up america's alliances so that collectively [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=152.32000000000002s)]
*  We could take on china more effectively with a whole united front of friends from asia europe and elsewhere [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=158.98000000000002s)]
*  Right now. I think shijin ping is getting up every day [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=165.38000000000002s)]
*  Turning on the news seeing what trump is doing and he's pulling out a big tub of popcorn because he's loving this [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=168.58s)]
*  He's seeing trump do what china would love to do undermine our alliances. Weak in america's standing and credibility in the world [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=174.82000000000002s)]
*  Take away america's advantage in science and innovation [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=181.94s)]
*  and he doesn't have to lift a finger for that so [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=185.3s)]
*  Part of this is about personnel [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=188.26000000000002s)]
*  But a lot of this is about policy and the policy of the last hundred days [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=189.70000000000002s)]
*  I think has put the united states in quite a deep hole [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=193.54000000000002s)]
*  So I was speaking to a few officials yesterday after the waltz's departure and and the idea that secretary state rubio now [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=195.54000000000002s)]
*  Has all these multiple jobs the version I got was well actually that doesn't matter that much because in this administration [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=202.42000000000002s)]
*  It's all about one man and one man only there's no team [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=207.94s)]
*  It's just president trump and that he is not he's not empowered his aides even his top cabin officials to do anything without him [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=210.02s)]
*  I know that's not how it worked during your four years under president biden [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=216.66s)]
*  Obviously, he was heavily involved but it was a process that process is gone talk to us about what that means that unpredictability uncertainty and chaos [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=219.94s)]
*  How difficult it is for the rest of the world to manage? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=228.1s)]
*  Well, let's just take the tariffs as an example. It's fine and right for the president of the united states to set the strategic direction [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=230.98s)]
*  But if you don't have a team that actually can work through the details you end up with the absolute chaos [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=237.94s)]
*  That we saw when they put out the tariff announcement then had to walk it back in a bunch of ways [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=244.1s)]
*  And the same thing could be replicated across a bunch of different features of us foreign policy as we go forward [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=248.73999999999998s)]
*  If you don't have senior empowered people in the national security advisor jobs secretary of state secretary of defense and on down the line [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=254.1s)]
*  President of the united states cannot execute [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=261.14s)]
*  Everything all the time in this complex world we live in they should be setting the direction and then have a real team that can execute [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=263.94s)]
*  So if they're going to keep going this way, we're going to see more chaos like we did with the tariff announcement [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=270.9s)]
*  Jake will he has the next question [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=275.78s)]
*  Jake good morning [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=278.5s)]
*  I want to ask you about ukraine and russia something we've been talking about all morning and obviously for several years now that you handled [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=279.22s)]
*  front and center during the biden administration [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=284.98s)]
*  I'm curious what you make of the way this administration has handled things in these negotiations [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=288.18s)]
*  They claim are ongoing the way that we've treated our ally [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=293.54s)]
*  Thinking about that oval office meeting where the president vice president dressed down president zelensky of ukraine [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=296.73999999999995s)]
*  It does seem that the burden is being placed almost entirely in this case on our ally on the victim of this invasion [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=302.97999999999996s)]
*  So how do you see a path forward here? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=310.17999999999995s)]
*  Well, first will you're totally right president trump approaches this issue [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=312.82s)]
*  With the completely false upside down notion that it was ukraine not russia that was responsible for this war [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=317.21999999999997s)]
*  And that it's ukraine not putin that's the obstacle to peace that is completely backwards [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=324.34s)]
*  And until president trump recognizes that flatimir putin [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=330.09999999999997s)]
*  Is the responsible party the aggressor the brutal dictator who rolled into a democratic state across his border [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=334.65999999999997s)]
*  And that flatimir putin is the one who is standing in the way of a ceasefire right now that ukraine has said it's willing to accept [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=342.34s)]
*  Until president trump recognizes that and puts real pressure [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=349.46s)]
*  On putin actually follows through on some of the threats he's begun to make [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=353.7s)]
*  Then we're going to have a very difficult time [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=358.1s)]
*  We're either not going to get a deal or it's going to be a deal that is unfair to ukraine and that will not lead to [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=359.94s)]
*  Adjust the durable peace and finally [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=365.06s)]
*  It's just one-on-one in negotiations that you do not give away concessions before the negotiations get started and yet [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=367.7s)]
*  This administration made multiple significant concessions including a promise ukraine can never be part of nato [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=374.66s)]
*  Including that russia can keep the territory it has they've even conceded that crime that the united states will recognize [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=381.06s)]
*  Crimea is part of russia something not even china has done [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=387.85999999999996s)]
*  I think that's been a mistake that also has put the united states behind the eight ball when it comes to getting a good deal [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=391.46s)]
*  for ukraine katie hay [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=397.06s)]
*  jake one of the most surprising things about the last three months is the degree to which the window has been opened for [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=399.06s)]
*  China to represent itself around the world as the reliable [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=404.09999999999997s)]
*  Superpower how much success realistically do you think? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=408.12s)]
*  china can have in [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=412.6s)]
*  Rebalancing countries that your administration spent a lot of time wooing assiduously whether it's around trade or national security issues [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=415.3s)]
*  Do you think they can they can actually build alliances with either europeans or other asian countries to replace america? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=422.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, let me give you two examples first [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=430.28s)]
*  Back in 2023 president biden hosted the prime minister of japan and the president of korea in a trilateral summit at camp [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=432.91999999999996s)]
*  David it was a historic moment these three countries coming together [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=440.44s)]
*  Just a few weeks ago china had a trilateral meeting with korea and japan [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=444.35999999999996s)]
*  To talk about what trade and how those three countries should work together in the face of what? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=450.59999999999997s)]
*  President trump has done and second when it comes to europe [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=455.71999999999997s)]
*  We spent a lot of time working with the europeans so that together we could de-risk from china [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=459.15999999999997s)]
*  Now the europeans are talking about de-risking from the united states [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=464.44s)]
*  This is the kind of strategic hole we now find ourselves in and you know joe you said earlier [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=468.52s)]
*  It was an own goal. This is a complete own goal. These are choices. We've made it's not something china's done [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=474.84s)]
*  We're doing their work for them and I think that's to our detriment really quickly the the ukraine deal that we heard about [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=480.12s)]
*  yesterday [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=486.09999999999997s)]
*  Any any chance that that might lead to us an effective ceasefire? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=487.48s)]
*  Look, i'm glad that it's been taken off the table as a point of real friction between the us and ukraine [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=491.88s)]
*  I'm glad they've settled it and put it aside [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=498.28000000000003s)]
*  But it doesn't fundamentally change the equation when it comes to donald trump having to recognize [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=500.6s)]
*  It's going to be pressure on putin and only pressure on putin that's going to get a good deal in this war [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=505.72s)]
*  I hope he finally recognizes all right former white house national security advisor jake sullivan [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=510.44s)]
*  Thanks so much for being with us. Thanks for having we appreciate it [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exEY41M4bLo&t=515.48s)]
