# 'The president needs to act': Lawmaker leads group to El Salvador calling for release of Garcia
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [April 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk)
*  Four House Democrats are in El Salvador this morning trying to secure the release of Kilmar [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=0.0s)]
*  Abrego-Garcia. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=5.58s)]
*  This comes just days after Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen's visit we heard from the [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=7.28s)]
*  senator just a few moments ago. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=11.76s)]
*  The lawmakers say they plan to meet with Salvadorian officials at the U.S. embassy to advocate [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=13.700000000000001s)]
*  for Abrego-Garcia's return and get information on the other migrants who were deported to [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=18.580000000000002s)]
*  a notorious Salvadorian prison. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=24.1s)]
*  Robert Garcia of California is leading the delegation and joins us now live from El Salvador. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=27.86s)]
*  Congressman, good morning. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=33.3s)]
*  Thank you for being with us this morning. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=34.3s)]
*  You're there with three fellow Democrats. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=36.82s)]
*  Talk to us. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=38.72s)]
*  Just start why this mission here is so important and not just about Mr. Abrego-Garcia, but [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=39.72s)]
*  all the others who were deported, many would say, without due process. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=46.34s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=50.42s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=51.86s)]
*  Look, what's really important here that people need to understand is we have the President [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=52.86s)]
*  of the United States defying a 9-0 unanimous Supreme Court decision to bring Kilmar back [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=56.7s)]
*  home to the United States. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=63.34s)]
*  This in my opinion is on its way to a constitutional crisis in this country. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=65.46000000000001s)]
*  You cannot defy not just the Supreme Court but also lower courts. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=68.62s)]
*  The Trump administration has also said that they sent Mr. Abrego-Garcia here on accident. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=72.22s)]
*  It is time to bring Kilmar home and we're continuing the work of Senator Van Hollen. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=77.34s)]
*  Look, we also will not be the last members of the delegation to be here. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=81.98s)]
*  There's other senators and members of Congress that will be here in El Salvador. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=85.86s)]
*  It's really important that we advocate for his release. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=89.7s)]
*  He has been wrongly sent here, as have by the way hundreds of other individuals who [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=92.7s)]
*  are in our country in different status, asylum seekers, people that were on some type of [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=98.44s)]
*  permit, some type of student visas we know of being deported across the country as well [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=103.3s)]
*  to other places. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=109.04s)]
*  And so this is a moment for us to stand for our values and for due process in this country. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=110.04s)]
*  We also know it's not just about Kilmar. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=116.53999999999999s)]
*  There's a young man named Avery down here, 19 years old, young gay man, hairdresser, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=117.53999999999999s)]
*  seeking asylum, got sent here. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=121.53999999999999s)]
*  We have no proof of life yet of how he's doing. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=123.46s)]
*  So we have a lot of work to do. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=125.62s)]
*  We're on our way actually to the embassy to get a classified briefing in just about an [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=127.06s)]
*  hour. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=131.38s)]
*  You're certainly right to highlight it's more than just this one case that's gotten so much [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=132.38s)]
*  attention. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=135.5s)]
*  You mentioned how the Trump administration seems to be in defiance or at least delay [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=136.72s)]
*  bordering on defiance of a Supreme Court ruling. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=141.62s)]
*  But they've also made the claim that they simply, well, we don't have any jurisdiction [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=144.45999999999998s)]
*  anymore. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=147.94s)]
*  He's in El Salvadorian custody. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=148.94s)]
*  Tell us what you make of that argument and what you'll say to the El Salvadorian officials [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=150.85999999999999s)]
*  you'll see later today. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=156.12s)]
*  Well, we know that there is no question that if Donald Trump, the president, wants to have [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=157.66s)]
*  Kilmar back home, he would be back home. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=163.22s)]
*  He of course has a very strong relationship with the president of El Salvador and they're [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=165.73999999999998s)]
*  working together on this. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=169.98s)]
*  The president of the United States sent Kilmar here by accident. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=171.5s)]
*  The courts have said he needs to return and the president needs to act. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=174.82s)]
*  We're here to continue that pressure on the Trump administration and also to build support [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=178.18s)]
*  here in El Salvador for Kilmar's release and to bring attention to the facility that's [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=183.46s)]
*  here, the jail that's here, where we have, we know hundreds of people, Venezuelan migrants, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=188.26s)]
*  people that are seeking asylum, folks that were here like Kilmar who were wrongly sent [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=193.5s)]
*  here. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=197.34s)]
*  The attention here on this issue is important, especially because you have a president that [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=198.34s)]
*  is defying the Supreme Court. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=203.14000000000001s)]
*  And I can't tell you how important it is in our country that every single person, regardless [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=204.66s)]
*  of where they're at in their status, whether they have a work visa, whether they have a [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=209.62s)]
*  student visa, whether they're exercising their free First Amendment rights, they have a due [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=213.14000000000001s)]
*  process right in our country and we've got to maintain that. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=217.26s)]
*  Democratic Congressman Robert Garcia of California, important words. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=220.98000000000002s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=224.98000000000002s)]
*  Safe travels to you. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAYikGsGpgk&t=225.98000000000002s)]
