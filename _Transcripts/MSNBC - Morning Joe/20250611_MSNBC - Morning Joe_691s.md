# He would turn over the state to Trump: New Jersey Democrat issues warning about opponent
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A)
*  The train is about people, not politics. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=0.0s)]
*  It's about vision, not division. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=4.36s)]
*  We won because of our positive energy. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=6.96s)]
*  We won because we talked about the issues that matter. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=9.36s)]
*  The critical issues facing our state and my plan for a safer, more prosperous and affordable [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=12.76s)]
*  New Jersey. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=18.72s)]
*  A state like this is not going to be led by a Trump lackey like Jack Chittarelli. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=21.12s)]
*  I am ready to shake up the status quo. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=30.0s)]
*  And Jack is the status quo. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=36.04s)]
*  Democratic Congresswoman Mike Sherrill and Republican Jack Chittarelli have won their [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=39.72s)]
*  party's primaries for governor in New Jersey. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=45.0s)]
*  Sherrill, in her victory speech last night, slammed her GOP opponent, whom she'll face [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=48.6s)]
*  off against this November. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=54.080000000000005s)]
*  Chittarelli won the Republican primary following an endorsement from President Trump. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=55.88s)]
*  And Congresswoman Sherrill joins us now. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  It's great to have you back on Morning Joe. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=65.2s)]
*  So tell us what your message to the voters would be as to why you should be the governor [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=68.68s)]
*  of New Jersey. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=73.58s)]
*  And that would make you having arguably the most impressive resume of all time, bar none, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=75.38s)]
*  given all the different incredible jobs you've already held. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=84.3s)]
*  Well, thanks so much, Mika. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=88.22s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=90.98s)]
*  And yeah, we had a great result last night. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=92.14s)]
*  Almost 800,000 people showing up in the Democratic primary. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=94.78s)]
*  That's record setting. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=99.18s)]
*  The people of New Jersey are ready to take on this fight. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=100.26s)]
*  And I think what you saw is that it is an indictment against the failed policies of [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=104.26s)]
*  Donald Trump, the constant attacks on our economy, on prices, on our rights and freedoms. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=109.06s)]
*  And we know Jack Chittarelli would be more of the same. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=115.52s)]
*  I mean, he is basically at every turn worked to show Trump that he would just do whatever [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=117.46000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump wants him to do. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=123.5s)]
*  And I think what we saw last night was that that is not what the people of New Jersey [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=125.3s)]
*  want to see. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=129.42s)]
*  Congresswoman, good morning. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=130.42s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=131.82s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=132.82s)]
*  I can confirm in a nonpartisan way your Jersey credentials because I saw you once at a Bruce [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=133.82s)]
*  Springsteen concert holding a sign that said Jersey girl actually making a request to Springsteen. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=137.5s)]
*  And he played it. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=143.38s)]
*  Remember, Willie, he played it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=144.38s)]
*  He played it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=146.17999999999998s)]
*  So your cred is intact. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=147.17999999999998s)]
*  So let's talk about your opponent, Mr. Chittarelli. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=149.54s)]
*  Donald Trump has supported him fully. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=152.54s)]
*  He in fact said that Jack Chittarelli is 100 percent MAGA. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=154.98s)]
*  So you've tied him to Donald Trump and the policies of this administration. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=159.38s)]
*  The thing is that might not be totally a bad thing for him in New Jersey considering Donald [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=163.57999999999998s)]
*  Trump only lost a state I grew up in, which was very blue, by six points. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=167.74s)]
*  That's to say that Donald Trump's popularity is increasing in New Jersey. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=173.14s)]
*  So how do you walk that line between trying to get some of those Trump voters to your [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=177.1s)]
*  side and criticizing Jack Chittarelli for being tied to Donald Trump? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=181.22s)]
*  You know, Willie, I think we saw last night that that is not where voters are. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=187.1s)]
*  We saw Dems come out at almost two to one the rate of Republicans yesterday. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=192.42000000000002s)]
*  I think the base is fired up. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=197.54s)]
*  People are ready to go. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=199.58s)]
*  And I've always run races where I've built broad coalitions, not just of Democrats, but [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=200.74s)]
*  of independents and Republicans, because I've always had a vision of serving the people [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=205.02s)]
*  of New Jersey as a former Navy helicopter pilot and a federal prosecutor and a mom of [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=209.94s)]
*  four kids. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=214.46s)]
*  It has always been my desire to serve the people and to create a better future for our [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=215.54s)]
*  kids. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=219.78s)]
*  And it's you know, it's not just that Jack Chittarelli said he's going to do anything [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=220.78s)]
*  and everything that Trump wants him to do. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=224.54s)]
*  It's that he has a record that doesn't serve the people of New Jersey. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=226.5s)]
*  So whether it's constantly raising taxes or not supporting people in Superstorm Sandy [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=230.29999999999998s)]
*  or really peddling the information of pharmaceutical companies who were trying to addict people [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=236.39999999999998s)]
*  and again and again and again, Chittarelli's put himself first. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=243.66s)]
*  He's now doing he's putting Trump first. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=246.9s)]
*  And that is not going to serve the people of my state. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=249.35999999999999s)]
*  Congresswoman Elizabeth Buehmiller with the New York Times has a question for you, Elizabeth. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=252.66s)]
*  Congratulations, Congresswoman. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=257.06s)]
*  I was going to just ask you, given what we were talking about at the top of the show, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=259.02s)]
*  which is about immigration and you're known as a centrist Democrat, strong military record, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=262.74s)]
*  obviously. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=267.94s)]
*  But I'm curious. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=268.94s)]
*  This will come up in your race. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=269.94s)]
*  What do you make so far of the Democratic response to Trump's crackdown in Los Angeles [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=272.26s)]
*  and on bringing in the military? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=279.65999999999997s)]
*  How do how do how will you navigate that and how do Democrats navigate that? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=281.86s)]
*  You know, I think we believe in strong public safety and keeping people safe. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=288.03999999999996s)]
*  Violence is never OK. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=292.18s)]
*  And at the same time, making sure we have the appropriate people in place to handle [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=293.98s)]
*  that. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=297.78s)]
*  I've heard from about how New York is handling that in a really thoughtful way in law enforcement. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=299.78s)]
*  We have people trained to handle protests. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=306.02s)]
*  It's part of our Constitution, the right to protest. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=309.41999999999996s)]
*  And so we have law enforcement, public safety officers trained to make sure those protests [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=312.46s)]
*  go off without violence, that people can gather in the streets to to register what they're [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=317.26s)]
*  concerned about. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=322.46s)]
*  And so the lack of understanding of the difference I've served for almost 10 years as a Navy [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=323.46s)]
*  helicopter pilot, then I served as a federal prosecutor working closely with law enforcement. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=328.06s)]
*  Those are two separate missions. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=333.38s)]
*  And we have law enforcement that is very capable and able to handle the mission. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=336.5s)]
*  And I think the real threat that the people of New Jersey see is that there's going to [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=340.74s)]
*  be a constant attack on our state from Donald Trump. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=345.34000000000003s)]
*  And Jack Chittarelli would just welcome it. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=348.72s)]
*  He'd really turn over the state to Trump as opposed to standing up for the people of New [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=351.46s)]
*  Jersey. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=356.06s)]
*  He's basically professed that's exactly what he's going to do. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=357.06s)]
*  And we see it again and again and again. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=360.42s)]
*  So, Congressman, obviously the president's use of the National Guard in Los Angeles has [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=362.7s)]
*  taken the headlines of late. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=368.22s)]
*  But this was of course this all began with over immigration and ICE agent raids there [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=369.86s)]
*  in Southern California. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=375.14s)]
*  There have been plenty in New Jersey as well. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=376.66s)]
*  And in fact, one of your colleagues, Congressman LaMonica MacIver, was just indicted by a federal [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=378.02s)]
*  grand jury yesterday because she is charged with obstructing ICE agents there outside [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=382.54s)]
*  a detention center. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=390.26000000000005s)]
*  So first, can we get your reaction to that news, your colleague being arrested? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=391.78000000000003s)]
*  But also, what would you do as governor in a similar situation if indeed President Trump [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=396.64000000000004s)]
*  deploying ICE agents in manners like this that some of your colleagues felt inappropriate, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=402.94s)]
*  perhaps unlawful? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=407.34000000000003s)]
*  You know, I think what we see with these charges is over a decade of prison time because a [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=409.14s)]
*  member of Congress was exercising her oversight duties. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=415.14s)]
*  This is, I think the people of New Jersey realize this is ridiculous. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=419.29999999999995s)]
*  This is punitive. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=422.58s)]
*  This is partisan politics at its worst because it's coming from the U.S. Attorney's Office, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=423.58s)]
*  my former office, where justice should be blind. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=429.05999999999995s)]
*  But instead, Alina Haba has pledged to make it very partisan. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=431.53999999999996s)]
*  And we're seeing that effect right now. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=435.21999999999997s)]
*  So here in New Jersey, we're fighting for a different kind of future. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=438.21999999999997s)]
*  We're fighting for our Constitution. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=441.9s)]
*  We're fighting for rights and freedoms. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=443.65999999999997s)]
*  We're also fighting so people can stay here and raise their families here. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=445.41999999999996s)]
*  I like to say this is the garden state where you plant your family and you grow your future. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=448.7s)]
*  We're driving down housing costs, utility costs, and then protecting people from all [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=453.73999999999995s)]
*  those attacks they see coming from Washington. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=458.14s)]
*  So Congresswoman, let's talk about that future in New Jersey. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=461.05999999999995s)]
*  So later today or tomorrow or at some point, you're out campaigning, someone comes up to [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=466.18s)]
*  you and says, listen, I'm married. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=469.97999999999996s)]
*  I own a home. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=472.97999999999996s)]
*  My wife is a school nurse. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=474.21999999999997s)]
*  Between us, we make an amazing living and my mind is an amazing living, maybe almost [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=475.94s)]
*  $200,000 between the two of us. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=480.82s)]
*  I have two kids, one in elementary school, one a freshman in high school. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=483.26s)]
*  I'm worried about them and their future and I'm getting taxed up the wazoo and we have [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=487.02s)]
*  no money. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=491.94s)]
*  What's our future look like and what does the future of my children look like? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=493.22s)]
*  Well, I know exactly what I'd say because I hear these stories all the time. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=497.38000000000005s)]
*  I've met with thousands of New Jerseyans over this campaign. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=503.22s)]
*  I've been up and down the state from Cape May to Bergen County and everywhere in between. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=506.46000000000004s)]
*  It's how I built the broad coalition and built that victory last night because I started [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=511.1s)]
*  by listening to people. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=516.62s)]
*  And you're talking the talk, right? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=518.46s)]
*  People are very concerned about affordability here. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=520.58s)]
*  The cost of housing has gone up by 50% over the past five years and I have pledged to [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=523.14s)]
*  be the governor that is going to build houses and drive down those costs so families can [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=528.18s)]
*  afford to stay here. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=532.6999999999999s)]
*  We have high property taxes, which I hear about all the time. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=534.54s)]
*  So we need to do something differently, make sure we're sharing services so that we can [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=538.1999999999999s)]
*  drive down those property taxes and then really investing in the future for our kids. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=542.38s)]
*  New Jersey runs some of the best public school systems in the nation. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=547.46s)]
*  We need to expand that opportunity to every child here in the state. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=551.12s)]
*  Congresswoman, you came into office with a group of other women who have national security [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=554.96s)]
*  backgrounds in the Democratic field. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=559.48s)]
*  I realize you're running for governor and so you're focused on that and nothing beyond [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=560.88s)]
*  that. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=564.64s)]
*  But the Democratic Party is obviously having a discussion about where the future of the [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=565.64s)]
*  party lies in terms of its leadership. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=569.4s)]
*  Do you see people like yourself, Abigail Spanberger, Alyssa Slotkin, as the future, the next generation [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=571.7s)]
*  of leaders in the Democratic Party? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=577.64s)]
*  You know, I think what you saw last night with that huge turn up, like I said, almost [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=581.04s)]
*  800,000 people, I keep saying that number because it's a mind boggling number for a [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=586.04s)]
*  Democratic primary in a non-presidential year. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=590.24s)]
*  It's a record setting number. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=594.52s)]
*  We've never had a primary that large in New Jersey. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=596.24s)]
*  And so I think what you saw there was this vision that is really compelling to Democrats [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=600.04s)]
*  across the state and I think across the country, this idea that, yeah, we are never, we are [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=605.88s)]
*  never backing away from rights and freedoms. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=610.76s)]
*  But we have got to get down to brass tacks of governing. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=614.28s)]
*  We have to deliver for people. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=617.42s)]
*  And right now, in some of our states, you know, it's just too hard for a middle class [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=618.72s)]
*  family to make a living, to afford a house, to afford utility bills, to afford the cost [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=623.56s)]
*  here. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=627.8s)]
*  So that is what I am laser focused on, is driving down costs and governing really effectively [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=628.8s)]
*  as I have a history of doing. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=635.88s)]
*  And I think that contrast with the chaos coming out of Washington, the attacks on our economy [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=637.6s)]
*  coming from Trump, the fact that Jack Chittarelli is just going to go lockstep along with it, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=642.12s)]
*  that contrast of a different vision, a vision of leadership, of effective governance, of [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=646.76s)]
*  driving down costs and protecting rights and freedoms, that has been compelling to the [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=651.6s)]
*  people of New Jersey. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=655.72s)]
*  I think that'd be compelling across the country. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=656.72s)]
*  Democratic Congresswoman and New Jersey Democratic Goodminatorial nominee, Mikey Sherrill, thank [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=660.72s)]
*  you very much for coming on the show this morning. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=666.6800000000001s)]
*  Thank you all. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=670.08s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=671.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgHM3BfuZ0A&t=690.72s)]
