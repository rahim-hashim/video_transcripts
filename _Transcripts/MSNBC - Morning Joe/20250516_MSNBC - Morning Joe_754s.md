# What happens from here as justices hear birthright citizenship case?
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA)
*  Let's turn to the Supreme Court. President Trump's goal of ending birthright citizenship [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=0.0s)]
*  is now in the hands of the Supreme Court. Justices heard oral arguments yesterday in [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=4.24s)]
*  the case of the Trump administration's fight with lower courts, which blocked his executive order, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=8.72s)]
*  barring citizenship to children born in the U.S. to undocumented parents. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=13.76s)]
*  NBC News senior legal correspondent Laura Jarrett has the latest. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=18.72s)]
*  The high stakes clash between the White House and the federal courts, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=23.2s)]
*  down with deportation. Reaching the Supreme Court. Presidents want to get things done. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=26.4s)]
*  The Trump administration hoping to convince the justices that a single federal judge in a [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=31.84s)]
*  single state has no authority to block an executive order for the entire country. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=36.56s)]
*  President Trump facing nearly 40 so-called nationwide injunctions on a host of issues [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=41.92s)]
*  so far in his second term, particularly on immigration, including the case about lower [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  courts blocking President Trump's executive order, stripping birthright citizenship for [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=53.04s)]
*  children born in the U.S. to undocumented immigrants. The court's conservative majority [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  seeming open to the administration's arguments on the dangers of judicial overreach. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=63.2s)]
*  There are 680 district court judges and they are dedicated and they are scholarly and I'm not impugning [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=68.16s)]
*  their motives in any way, but you know, sometimes they're wrong. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=75.75999999999999s)]
*  But some liberal members of the court grilling the administration on what happens if judges [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=78.88s)]
*  cannot block an executive order they believe is illegal on a nationwide basis. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=84.32s)]
*  Let's just assume you're dead wrong. Does every single person that is affected by this EO have [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=89.6s)]
*  to bring their own suit? Democratic state officials backing the suit arguing a patchwork of citizenship [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  would emerge if the administration wins here with rights varying from state to state. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=103.12s)]
*  Still, there has been bipartisan criticism of judges abusing nationwide injunctions, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  incentivizing so-called judge shopping for sympathetic courts. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=114.39999999999999s)]
*  We are being hit hard by judges that I think they're trying to take away the power of the presidency. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=118.72s)]
*  Laura Jarrett reporting for us there. Let's bring in former U.S. attorney and MSNBC contributor [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=125.67999999999999s)]
*  Chuck Rosenberg. Chuck, good morning. So just fascinating, I'm sure for you, but for all of us [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=130.56s)]
*  too, to sit and listen to this open debate in the Supreme Court about such a critical [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=134.96s)]
*  constitutional question. It seems there are two things at play. There's the issue at hand of [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=138.96s)]
*  birthright citizenship guaranteed in the Constitution, but then this larger question [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=144.08s)]
*  of the ability of district courts to strike down orders from the president, executive orders. So [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=149.04000000000002s)]
*  it's a lot to sift through, I know, but what did you take away from what you heard yesterday [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=155.84s)]
*  inside the court? Right, I think the court really is wrestling with two very different models. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=160.0s)]
*  If something is clearly unconstitutional, you want a federal district court judge wherever she may [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=166.24s)]
*  be sitting to be able to put a nationwide halt to it. But to Justice Alito's point, sometimes these [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=171.52s)]
*  judges are wrong and you've imposed a rule on everyone, even though everyone may not be a party [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=178.48s)]
*  to the suit in a particular case. On the other hand, the other side of this tension is that [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=183.76s)]
*  district court judges sit in a particular place, in Seattle, in Topeka, in Wichita. And [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=193.92s)]
*  if they have something in, you know, it may be the case that a party is seeking out a particular [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=201.44s)]
*  judge, judge shopping, purposefully, really, to get an order, you know, nationwide to get a blanket [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=206.24s)]
*  order. But what do you do when, and let's just assume the executive order turns out to be [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=213.84s)]
*  unconstitutional on birthright citizenship, do you really want to have every single person who [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=220.08s)]
*  may be harmed by the executive order filing individual lawsuits in 94 different federal [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=226.48000000000002s)]
*  district courts? Right? So that on one hand, that seems highly inefficient. So you're trying [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=231.92s)]
*  to balance a system that wants agility and fairness and uniformity and efficiency, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=237.2s)]
*  with a system in which we normally require plaintiffs to bring a case when they are [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=244.23999999999998s)]
*  adversely affected. It's a tough trade off. And you could see the Supreme Court wrestling with it. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=250.32s)]
*  And frankly, as much as I watch this stuff, it's not clear to me how they're going to come out or [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=256.71999999999997s)]
*  when they're going to come out with a new rule. So Claire, if you listened yesterday, it does appear [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=260.96s)]
*  that the court is broadly skeptical of this president or any president's ability to strike [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=266.79999999999995s)]
*  down birthright citizenship. It's in the Constitution. But we did hear from Justice Alito [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=272.4s)]
*  and a couple of others, an openness to the idea that perhaps district judges should not have this [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=277.2s)]
*  broad ability to file injunctions to stop the president's executive orders. So what did you [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=283.67999999999995s)]
*  hear as you listened yesterday? Well, it's interesting to me that a French theory, legal [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=290.0s)]
*  theory that has been struck down by every court that's heard it in the country is being proposed [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=295.68s)]
*  with a straight face. So that's a starting point. The second point is, you know, Chuck's right. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=303.36s)]
*  We're talking about uniformity versus the power of what is essentially a trial judge in the federal [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=310.56s)]
*  system. That's what people need to understand. The people who are issuing these injunctions [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=316.64s)]
*  are not any kind of appellate court. They're the entry point into the federal system. So I guess [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=321.28s)]
*  what I want to know, Chuck, is it seems to me that there is a middle ground here. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=328.15999999999997s)]
*  It seems to me that if it is something that is this chaotic in that one person could be a citizen [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=334.56s)]
*  in one state and then cross the line and be deported in the next for being an immigrant [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=344.64s)]
*  that does not have legal status. That is crazy. We can't have that. So how optimistic are you [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=351.44s)]
*  after listening yesterday that they'll find some middle ground to say, if there is a serious [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=358.48s)]
*  constitutional question, the right to bear arms, the freedom of speech, birthright citizenship that [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=364.96s)]
*  is laid out in the constitution, that they can either have an expedited appeal regardless [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=371.36s)]
*  of whether someone appeals? Because that's the problem, right? That the Trump administration [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=377.12s)]
*  may decide not to appeal and just get what they can because they know they're going to lose if [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=382.8s)]
*  they appeal. Is there a middle ground here? So much to my detriment, Claire, I'm always optimistic. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=386.64s)]
*  I think you can fashion a rule where if there is a constitutional question and a lot of people [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=392.08000000000004s)]
*  would be harmed, right, if it was the fake birthright citizenship or the right to bear arms, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=398.16s)]
*  if a lot of people would be harmed by a particular executive order, that you can get this to the [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=405.6s)]
*  Supreme Court quickly and a single federal district court judge would have nationwide [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=411.44000000000005s)]
*  injunction powers. But fashioning that rule is tricky, right, because it's in the eye of the [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=416.48s)]
*  beholder. What's important to one person may not be important to another. What seems unconstitutional [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=422.0s)]
*  to us may seem perfectly constitutional to a scholar coming at it from a different perspective. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=427.52s)]
*  It's a hard and you can see the justices wrestling with this. A couple of them asked, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=433.59999999999997s)]
*  how do we get this question in front of us and how do we get it quickly? How do you propose to [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=438.32s)]
*  get it to us? Can they decide it now if they want to? In theory, yes, they could. They should. Well, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=443.12s)]
*  I think they should, but I don't think of this as a Democrat-Republican problem or a liberal [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=448.32s)]
*  conservative problem. This is a president versus courts problem. And whether you're a Democratic [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=453.84s)]
*  president or a Republican president, recent presidents have been bedeviled by this very issue. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=459.76s)]
*  And so I think the Supreme Court does need to come up with a fix, a way to get constitutional [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=465.28s)]
*  questions to them quickly without introducing a ton of disparity into this federal system. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=470.96s)]
*  So, Eugene Robinson, let's bring you in on this. It has been so well laid out. It's really two [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=477.03999999999996s)]
*  things going on at once, the issue on fourth-right citizenship and then about [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=481.12s)]
*  nationwide injunctions. Tell us about what you heard yesterday and your hopes or fears [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=484.4s)]
*  about the implications going forward. Well, that quote we came in with from Justice Katanji Brown [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=490.64s)]
*  Jackson, I thought was absolutely spot on because it looks like a sort of catch me if you can [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=498.32s)]
*  situation in which the government says, you know, I can do it over here. I can do it over there. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=505.84s)]
*  You stop me there. I can do it someplace else. And everybody's got to file a lawsuit and got to [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=512.0s)]
*  file it in a timely fashion or else they have the rights taken away. That doesn't seem like a [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=519.4399999999999s)]
*  situation that anyone should want in this country. But, you know, I've heard there's a saying in the [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=526.4s)]
*  legal profession that bad cases make bad law. I wonder, Chuck, about this case. Birthright citizenship [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=534.4s)]
*  is, it strikes, it seems to be everybody here this morning and maybe a majority of the justices [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=543.12s)]
*  think this is kind of a settled question, that the 14th Amendment is pretty clear on this, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=551.92s)]
*  is very clear on this. So is this the right case to sort of fashion that some sort of middle ground [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=557.84s)]
*  that would affect other cases that are not so clear cut? And, you know, beyond that, do you think [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=567.6800000000001s)]
*  there is any chance that the court will actually rule on the substance of birthright citizenship [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=577.6800000000001s)]
*  this time? Yeah, so first, Eugene, is this the right case? I mean, the Supreme Court has had [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=583.44s)]
*  the ability, you know, to rule on this issue many times in the past and sort of kick that can down [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=590.24s)]
*  the road. I do think we need a rule. I do think we need some direction from the Supreme Court about [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=596.6400000000001s)]
*  whether a single federal district court judge can issue a nationwide or non-party injunction. Is this [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=604.4000000000001s)]
*  the right case for it? It's as good as any other. I mean, the underlying issue, to your point, Eugene, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=611.36s)]
*  birthright citizenship needs to be resolved because you don't want disparity. You don't want to be [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=617.2s)]
*  a citizen in one state and not a citizen in another. That makes no sense at all in our federal system. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=623.6s)]
*  So I think the Supreme Court can fashion a rule. I hope they do it quickly. I hope they do it clearly. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=630.72s)]
*  Again, nationwide injunctions have been a problem for many past presidents. It's not just a Trump [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=636.88s)]
*  thing. It happened to Biden. It happened to Bush. It happened to Obama. And it will continue to [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=643.1999999999999s)]
*  happen unless the Supreme Court can give us some order here. So, Chuck, fascinating to hear these [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=648.3199999999999s)]
*  two hours of oral arguments, this conversation out in the open. But the question now is what happens [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=655.4399999999999s)]
*  from here? Just as a practical matter, what's the next step? Right. Well, so if the Supreme [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=661.28s)]
*  Court says that nationwide injunctions are improper and that they are not going to rule on [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=666.8s)]
*  the underlying birthright citizenship question just yet, then you're going to see many, many, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=674.3199999999999s)]
*  many more cases brought in the federal system by people who might be affected by Mr. Trump's [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=680.9599999999999s)]
*  executive order. It would be more litigation. It would be more churn. It would be more chaos. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=686.48s)]
*  You could have different rulings in different places. Ultimately, Willie, the birthright [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=691.76s)]
*  citizenship question will be before the Supreme Court. I hope sooner rather than later. And to [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=696.88s)]
*  Eugene's point, I think it's reasonably settled law. Doesn't mean it can't change. But we've had [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=702.16s)]
*  Supreme Court precedent dating back to 1898. And as you well know, the 14th Amendment dating back [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=708.64s)]
*  to 1868, which suggests that somebody who is born in this country to parents who are undocumented [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyTANLoneA&t=713.76s)]
