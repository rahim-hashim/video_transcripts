# 'Raises a lot of questions': Qatar has spent nearly $100B in the U.S. to gain influence: Report
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE)
*  Giving the United States Air Force a jet, okay? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=0.0s)]
*  And it's a great thing. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=3.2s)]
*  But for you to go onto a subject about a jet that was given to the United States Air Force, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=4.44s)]
*  which is a very nice thing, they also gave $5.1 trillion worth of investment. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=10.16s)]
*  That was President Trump in the White House last week, misstating the amount of money [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=16.04s)]
*  that Qatar gives to the United States. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=21.44s)]
*  It's in the billions. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=23.6s)]
*  The question is, what does Qatar want in return? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=24.6s)]
*  Some new reporting from the pre-press this month looked into how Qatar bought America [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=28.04s)]
*  ahead of President Trump's visit to the country as part of his trip to the Middle East. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=32.64s)]
*  The piece reads, in part, countries have always used money to advance their interests abroad. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=36.94s)]
*  And recipients know the bargain often includes real politic that requires them to hold their [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=41.239999999999995s)]
*  noses. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=46.0s)]
*  Qatar is an extreme example of that geopolitical codependence. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=47.0s)]
*  The influence built by Qatar and the U.S. has no modern parallel, whether compared with [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=50.68s)]
*  large American companies seeking to influence antitrust policy, energy firms trying to win [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=55.56s)]
*  new drilling rights, or other foreign governments aiming to shape U.S. policy or shield themselves [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=60.64s)]
*  from it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=66.08s)]
*  The article continues, for comparison, Qatar spent three times more in the U.S. than Israel [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=67.08s)]
*  did on lobbyists, public relations advertisers, and other foreign agents in 2021, nearly two [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=72.28s)]
*  thirds as much as China did. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=78.64s)]
*  That's according to the government's latest report. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=80.6s)]
*  This graphic produced by the free press shows how that spending breaks down totaling more [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=83.16000000000001s)]
*  than $93 billion. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=88.24000000000001s)]
*  Let's bring in one of the reporters on this fascinating story for the free press, Franny [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=91.04s)]
*  Block. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  Franny, great to see you. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=95.96000000000001s)]
*  Welcome back. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  So this is, we want to answer the big question of why exactly Qatar is doing this and what [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  they expect in return. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=103.04s)]
*  But let's kind of break down where they're spending their money. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=104.60000000000001s)]
*  We hear about universities, we hear about lobbying. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=107.76s)]
*  Where is all this money going here in America? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=110.92s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=113.12s)]
*  So I actually wrote these figures down because I knew they were so important. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=114.12s)]
*  So again, in about the past decade, Qatar has invested over $30 billion in various businesses, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=116.92s)]
*  over $20 billion in energy investments in the United States, over $8 billion to build [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  Al Udeid, which is the United States' largest military base in the Middle East, again, funded [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=129.04s)]
*  by Qatar. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=133.64s)]
*  Steve Wittkopf went on Tucker Carlson's show a few weeks ago saying they pay for every [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=134.64s)]
*  dime of it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=137.72s)]
*  And over $6.3 billion to American universities, including universities like Georgetown and [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=138.96s)]
*  Northwestern which actually have campuses in Doha. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=144.96s)]
*  So that's where a lot of the money's going. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=148.16s)]
*  Let's take the universities because that's sort of front and center before us for a lot [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=149.56s)]
*  of people. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=153.24s)]
*  Why is Qatar spending $6 billion on American universities? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=154.4s)]
*  What are they getting out of that deal? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=158.28s)]
*  Well, obviously that is a central question and we can speculate on what that why is, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=159.92s)]
*  but we don't know exactly what it is. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=164.48s)]
*  I think in part you can see that Qatar is able to influence what American universities [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=166.32s)]
*  are focusing on. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=172.48s)]
*  They're able to influence kind of who is brought to campus in some cases. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=173.72s)]
*  And obviously with these Doha campuses, I think they're getting access to key figures, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=177.07999999999998s)]
*  key academics. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  I think this gives them unprecedented access to think tanks and kind of the producers of [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=182.51999999999998s)]
*  policy in the United States. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=187.22s)]
*  Again, universities are where our young people are educated. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=188.79999999999998s)]
*  These are the people that then grow up to be our next generation of leaders. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=192.16s)]
*  And I think Qatar sees an amazing opportunity to have an impact on what those students are [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=195.52s)]
*  learning in the classroom. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=201.12s)]
*  Some of this, of course, is just classic soft power. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=202.46s)]
*  This is something the United States used to do, invest in other countries and try to reap [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=204.56s)]
*  the benefits. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=208.20000000000002s)]
*  And we're seeing here, you know, that Qatar spent over $225 million on U.S. lobbying and [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=209.20000000000002s)]
*  PR, which is since 2021, which is 2017, which is three times more than Israel did in that [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=213.24s)]
*  same window. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=219.28s)]
*  And there's also just in the Trump administration, we have seen there these relationships. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=220.28s)]
*  Steve Whitcoff just mentioned. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=224.44s)]
*  Also, let's not forget, they're trying to give President Donald Trump a plane. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=225.64000000000001s)]
*  They are. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=229.8s)]
*  And I think, again, especially with the Trump administration, it raises so many different [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=230.8s)]
*  questions when you start to break down how many different people in Trump world have [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=234.28s)]
*  ties to Qatar in one way or another. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=238.52s)]
*  So you mentioned Steve Whitcoff just a couple years ago. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=240.32s)]
*  He got an over $600 million essentially buyout from the Qatari government for a bad investment [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=243.16s)]
*  deal he'd made in a Park Avenue hotel. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=248.32s)]
*  Let's look at Pam Bondi, the attorney general. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=250.68s)]
*  She used to be a lobbyist for Qatar. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=253.0s)]
*  Kash Patel, the director of the FBI. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=254.56s)]
*  He used to actually do work for Qatar, though he never registered under the Foreign Agents [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=257.08s)]
*  Registration Act. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=260.72s)]
*  So this all raises a lot of questions. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=262.16s)]
*  Let's look at Trump's sons traveling to Doha, participating in conferences, Trump's businesses, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=264.8s)]
*  investing in golf courses. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=269.56s)]
*  This raises a lot of questions. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=271.4s)]
*  What kind of influence is Qatar looking to buy? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=272.72s)]
*  And I think it's very clear that they're targeting Trump's world to try to gain that influence. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=275.16s)]
*  Eugene Robinson, I'll let you take it here, but let's remind people what Qatar does, who [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=280.88s)]
*  it is as a nation, which is somebody who supports Hamas, who funds Hamas, who shelters the Taliban, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=285.48s)]
*  among many other things. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=292.8s)]
*  They're not exactly clean actors in this world. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=294.8s)]
*  No, they're not exactly clean actors. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=297.84000000000003s)]
*  They have sort of positioned themselves interestingly as, for example, the go-between. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=299.96000000000004s)]
*  It's the country that can talk to Hamas. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=309.08s)]
*  So when there needs to be a negotiation with Hamas, you could do it through Qatar. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=311.8s)]
*  So it's an interesting game they're playing. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=319.44s)]
*  Freddie, I'm interested in whether the Qataris are spending in other places as well. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=322.08s)]
*  Are they trying to buy influence in China, in Europe? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=330.59999999999997s)]
*  Or is this just U.S.-focused, which suggests that maybe they see a particular vulnerability [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=334.52s)]
*  in Trump's world? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=341.64s)]
*  Well, actually, there have been scandals coming out over the past year showing how Qatari [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=343.15999999999997s)]
*  money is making its way into the governments all across the world. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=347.84s)]
*  There was a massive scandal actually in Europe just within the past year called Qatargate. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=350.71999999999997s)]
*  Also in Israel, this scandal is currently unfolding, showing how Qatari money has even [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=355.91999999999996s)]
*  made its way into Benjamin Netanyahu's office. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=360.53999999999996s)]
*  Qatari money is all over the world. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=364.1s)]
*  And obviously, the United States, as one of the largest global superpowers, is going to [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=366.34s)]
*  be one of Qatar's targets as well. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=369.9s)]
*  Is anyone, Freddie, raising red flags about this in the government, in the Congress? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=371.42s)]
*  People saying, hang on a second, this government that does all the things it does with Hamas [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=375.56s)]
*  and the Taliban and Iran and everyone else, we probably shouldn't be in bed with them [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=380.38s)]
*  the way we are? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=384.82s)]
*  There are definitely members of the government raising red flags. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=385.82s)]
*  But I also think part of what my investigation in the free press unveiled is that there are [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=388.74s)]
*  people on both sides of the aisle that are receiving the influence of the Qatari government, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=394.14s)]
*  whether that's through lobbying. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=400.46000000000004s)]
*  You have somebody like Jim Moran. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=401.54s)]
*  He's a former Democratic congressman. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=402.86s)]
*  He is now a registered lobbyist for Qatar. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=404.86s)]
*  You have a guy named Andrew King. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=406.98s)]
*  He's the former chief of staff of Lindsey Graham, a Republican in Congress. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=408.98s)]
*  He is also a registered lobbyist for Qatar. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=413.02s)]
*  So Qatar is going after both sides of the aisle. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=414.82s)]
*  They're going after conservative media and liberal media. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=416.74s)]
*  They're going after universities. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyGW1KiB4eE&t=419.26s)]
