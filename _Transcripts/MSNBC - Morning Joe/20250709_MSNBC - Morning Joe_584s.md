# Local officials in Texas face questioning about areas caught off guard by floodwaters
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80)
*  Residents are waking up, Jonathan, to yet another day of devastation following Friday's overwhelming storm. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, the numbers are unbearable. The death toll now rising to over 100 people, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=7.68s)]
*  with at least 170 still missing across that devastated area. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=12.8s)]
*  NBC News national correspondent Morgan Chesky has the latest on the search for survivors, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=18.48s)]
*  that desperate search, and the harrowing stories of those impacted by these fatal floods. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=23.92s)]
*  This morning in the grief-stricken Texas Hill country, hope of finding survivors from [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=30.48s)]
*  Friday's devastating flooding is fading. Yet despite the odds, volunteers like Huntley [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=34.8s)]
*  Dantzler refusing to give up. The biggest thing we're looking for is we're looking for places [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  where there has not been foot traffic. These before and after satellite images providing a [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=45.2s)]
*  glimpse at the enormous scope and scale of the historic disaster. Local officials facing questions [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  about why so many were caught off guard by the fast rising flood waters. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=55.36s)]
*  Was the emergency manager awake at the time? Did they push the button to issue an emergency alert? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=60.56s)]
*  Sir, it's not that easy when you just push a button. Did it happen, sir? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=66.48s)]
*  I can't tell you at this time. Governor Abbott stressing the state was prepared. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=70.48s)]
*  Who's to blame? Know this. That's the word choice of losers. Let me explain one thing about Texas, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=74.8s)]
*  and that is Texas, every square inch of our state cares about football. The losing teams are the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=84.0s)]
*  ones that try to point out who's to blame. The way winners talk is not to point fingers. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=91.28s)]
*  It comes as records obtained by NBC News shows that Camp Mystic had an emergency plan in place. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=96.88000000000001s)]
*  Texas officials signing off on it just two days before the floods. Meanwhile, we're learning more [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=103.04s)]
*  about the victims, including nine-year-old Lainey Landry, a Camp Mystic attendee. Her [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=108.56s)]
*  family's church boasting a photo from Lainey's first communion. This photo showing one of the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=114.4s)]
*  cabins full of girls that was overwhelmed. Several of the children now confirmed dead. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=119.44s)]
*  Some young survivors sharing their stories like 10-year-old Lucy Kennedy. I woke up to like really [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=125.44s)]
*  loud thunder. I just had a gut feeling that something bad was about to happen. Lucy, a Mystic [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=131.28s)]
*  camper, just like her mother, Wynn recounting the traumatic experience from Friday morning. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=136.56s)]
*  People from like different cabins started coming to our porch and yelling like, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=142.0s)]
*  wake up and go to rec hall because there's a flood. Evacuated by helicopter, the 10-year-old [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=146.0s)]
*  soon looked down on a summer paradise, turned Texas tragedy. That was NBC's Morgan Chesky with [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=152.56s)]
*  that report. Joining us now live from Kerrville, Texas is NBC News national correspondent Aaron [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=160.4s)]
*  Gilchrist. Aaron, what's the latest there? Well, today is going to be another day of [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=167.28s)]
*  intensive search efforts for folks in this county and Kerr County here as well as in other places [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=175.04000000000002s)]
*  around the area because there are still a lot of people who are missing. We talked about the fact [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=180.56s)]
*  that yesterday we finally got a number from, it came from Governor Abbott here, but the local [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=185.60000000000002s)]
*  officials also were able to say that they are still looking for upwards of 160 people. Just in [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=191.84s)]
*  Kerr County alone, 12 people in other places that were impacted by the flooding here and the governor [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=197.76000000000002s)]
*  indicated that that number could change. It could get bigger as they're able to collect more [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=203.12s)]
*  information. They've had people reaching out to officials here in Texas looking for people that [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=207.84s)]
*  they can't find. And so officials were able to take that information from callers and cross [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=213.52s)]
*  reference it with the list that they're developing of those who have already been discovered deceased [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=219.44s)]
*  and figure out that they need to find at least another 160 people. And so we've seen these [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=225.12s)]
*  search and rescue teams across the state of Texas coming from other states as well, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=229.68s)]
*  arriving here over the last few days from several other states. And they're going to be continuing [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=234.16000000000003s)]
*  this effort in the air, on the ground, as well as on the water, looking for people as they've [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=239.84s)]
*  been doing for the last several days now. At the same time, we are getting bits of information about [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=245.04s)]
*  the impact outside of the individual, the people impact that we've seen in terms of death here. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=250.4s)]
*  There have also been instances where people are trying to sort of put their lives back together. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=256.16s)]
*  People who survived the flooding, you may be able to see some of the debris behind me outside this [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=260.72s)]
*  home. And this is a house that was impacted by about, we think maybe three feet of water came [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=265.52s)]
*  inside this home up from the Guadalupe River. And the homeowners have had to pull out all the [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=272.4s)]
*  things in their home that were ruined. And this is really the reality that many families in this [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=277.68s)]
*  area are having to deal with, trying to put their lives back together after devastation. Even those [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=284.15999999999997s)]
*  who didn't lose a loved one are going to have to deal with a dramatic change in their lives. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=290.72s)]
*  The city has said that they believe there are millions of cubic yards of debris all over the [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=295.68s)]
*  city of Kerrville, for example. They are going to use unused soccer fields to try to get all this [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=302.40000000000003s)]
*  debris into central places so they can start to get rid of it at some point. At the same time, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=308.24s)]
*  we understand that the stormwater plant here in Kerrville also was severely damaged by the flooding. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=312.56s)]
*  There is a lot of work, a lot of recovery that still needs to be done in so many communities [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=318.40000000000003s)]
*  around this central Texas region. It's going to take weeks for the search effort to go forward, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=323.52000000000004s)]
*  and it could take that long or longer for this community to totally recover. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=330.40000000000003s)]
*  Let me ask you about something we just heard in Morgan's package of a moment ago. Obviously, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=334.88s)]
*  it's an area just stricken with grief. But he says there's also a sense of rising anger, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=340.48s)]
*  at the lack of preparations, at the lack of response, at how the local state, even federal [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=346.32s)]
*  government is responding. Are you picking up on that? What are people you're seeing there? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=351.04s)]
*  So I'm hearing a little bit of both. There are people here who have expressed their gratitude, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=358.24s)]
*  obviously, to the first responders who are doing the heavy lifting here, if you will. And also, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=362.8s)]
*  they've said that they feel as though the city did what it needed to do to be helpful to them [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=368.08s)]
*  in the earliest hours after this disaster. But there are other people who are upset that they [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=372.64s)]
*  didn't get the sort of warning that they would expect when there is such a massive flooding [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=377.2s)]
*  incident in this area. We've talked about the fact that there are no sirens here in Kerr County. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=382.24s)]
*  There are some a little farther downriver. But in this area, people feel like they didn't get the [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=387.44s)]
*  sort of warning that they should have been able to get. You saw the sheriff here was asked, you [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=392.48s)]
*  know, who was in charge? Who was processing information as it was coming in from the [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=397.68s)]
*  National Weather Service? Who was making decisions about whether there needed to be evacuations or [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=402.24s)]
*  alerts? Was that person awake at 1 a.m. when that biggest alert, the first big, big alert, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=407.36s)]
*  came to the National Weather Service on Friday morning? And the sheriff wasn't able to answer [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=414.16s)]
*  that question. There was going to be another briefing this morning in about an hour or so, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=418.72s)]
*  I think. And that question will come up again for the sheriff. We are looking for some accounting [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=423.2s)]
*  of when city and county officials here knew that there was going to be a major flooding event, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=428.8s)]
*  even if they didn't know it was going to be 30 feet of water, when did they know it was going to [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=435.03999999999996s)]
*  be a significant flooding event? And what actions did they take and when to try to make sure they [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=438.71999999999997s)]
*  they could save some lives, John? And Aaron, lastly, do you have a sense that there will also be [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=443.52s)]
*  questions about what the community is doing for the next time? There will be another storm. This [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=448.24s)]
*  is an era of climate change. They're increasing frequency and strength. The next storm could be [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=454.48s)]
*  just weeks away, perhaps. What are some even some interim measures being taken there [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=460.48s)]
*  to make sure something like this doesn't happen again? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=465.6s)]
*  In the short term, it really isn't a question that's been answered. Again, we've been asking [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=470.24s)]
*  about the alerts and what they're doing to make sure people are getting information. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=474.24s)]
*  The National Weather Service very early on came out and said it used every resource that it had [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=477.84s)]
*  available to try to get the word out about the coming flood potential. And then once the flooding [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=483.03999999999996s)]
*  started, they used their typical channels of communication, social media, they alerted [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=489.59999999999997s)]
*  localities as they do with with information, and they were hopeful that people would get the [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=495.12s)]
*  alerts. People's cell phones went off at one o'clock in the morning on Friday. If you've ever heard [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=499.84s)]
*  that amber alert sound on your cell phone, that's the sort of sound that people would have gotten [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=505.68s)]
*  on their phones if they had service or they were in an area or if they had that function turned on [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=510.0s)]
*  on their phones. And so now the conversation has turned to why aren't there sirens installed in [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=515.84s)]
*  this county that has a river bank that is in a floodplain, a known floodplain, a place that is [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=521.28s)]
*  called Flash Flood Alley. And that's something that we've heard state officials say it's a [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=528.32s)]
*  conversation to have now and the money needs to be found immediately to start installing that [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=533.2s)]
*  sort of a system. We'll be watching, John, to see exactly when that actually happens. If the money's [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=538.88s)]
*  there, then how quickly can they get those sirens up for another potential event? All right, NBC News [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=544.32s)]
*  National correspondent Aaron Gilchrist reporting live from Kerrville, Texas. Thank you very much [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=551.2800000000001s)]
*  for your reporting. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=556.5600000000001s)]
*  you [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSxfvA3FC80&t=563.2s)]
