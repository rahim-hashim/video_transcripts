# White House clarifies Trump's plan to 'take over' Gaza
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y)
*  House is attempting this morning to clarify President Trump's proposal for the United [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=0.0s)]
*  States to take over Gaza. On Tuesday, the president announced the U.S. should own the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=4.8s)]
*  enclave, redevelop it, and reallocate, relocate two million Palestinians who live there to [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=10.16s)]
*  either Egypt or Jordan. Those two countries have said they are not willing to do that. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=16.2s)]
*  He also suggested American troops could be deployed to Gaza to carry out that plan. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=20.76s)]
*  Comments of course sparked international backlash, especially from Arab countries. Now the White [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=25.919999999999998s)]
*  House appears to be walking back part of the president's proposal while defending his idea. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=30.52s)]
*  The president has not committed to putting boots on the ground in Gaza. He has also said [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=35.72s)]
*  that the United States is not going to pay for the rebuilding of Gaza. His administration is going [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=42.0s)]
*  to work with our partners in the region to reconstruct this region. And let me just take [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=46.84s)]
*  a step back here because this is an out of the box idea. That's who President Trump is. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=52.599999999999994s)]
*  That's why the American people elected him. And his goal is lasting peace in the Middle East [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  for all people in the region. What President Trump announced yesterday is the offer, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=64.32s)]
*  the willingness of the United States to become responsible for the reconstruction of that area. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=69.88s)]
*  It was not meant as a hostile move. It was meant as a, I think, a very generous move, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=75.72s)]
*  the offer to rebuild and to be in charge of the rebuilding of a place, many parts of which right [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=80.4s)]
*  now, even if people move back, they would have nowhere to live safely because there are still [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=84.8s)]
*  unexploded munitions and debris and rubble. The definition of insanity is attempting to do the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=88.8s)]
*  same thing over and over and over again. And as the president and prime minister pointed out [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=95.2s)]
*  last night, the president is willing to think outside the box, look for new and unique dynamic [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=100.0s)]
*  ways to solve problems that have felt like they're intractable. Joe, interesting to hear [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=106.32s)]
*  from defense secretary Hegseth and secretary of state Rubio there because it's reported this [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=112.32s)]
*  morning in the New York Times that president Trump did not consult either the department of defense [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=116.63999999999999s)]
*  or the department of state before making this announcement in an open press availability with [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. So again, what we're seeing is Donald Trump throwing out a radical [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=127.83999999999999s)]
*  idea, his staff scrambling in behind him and really the whole of the American government [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=132.08s)]
*  scrambling behind him to make sense of it or to explain it away. Well, you know, and that really [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=136.72s)]
*  is, and I've been saying this for months now, I've been talking about the need to separate the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  signal from the ground noise. And when he said this, so many people sort of laughed, rolled their [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=146.88000000000002s)]
*  eyes and now he's just saying it, maybe sometimes he does that to distract from something else that's [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=153.12s)]
*  going on. Maybe it's Elon Musk ripping through the federal government and trying to get access [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=158.4s)]
*  to things he doesn't have the legal right to get access to. Or maybe it is just as we've said about [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=165.36s)]
*  the tariffs from the beginning, maybe it is the opening bit of something, present something so [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=171.6s)]
*  shocking that other countries have to reset in the way they negotiate. And that is the way he works, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=176.8s)]
*  David Ignatius. And even though many of our allies and fewer of our enemies understand that, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=185.76s)]
*  I know I spoke with people in the region over the past couple of days, and even if it was an opening [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=194.56s)]
*  bit, even if a day after, everybody's saying, okay, well, they seem to be backing off. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=200.0s)]
*  Talk about your reporting and how our allies were deeply shaken by this. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=207.51999999999998s)]
*  So our enemies, our enemies were thrilled by this because what propaganda for Iran, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=214.64000000000001s)]
*  what propaganda for Hamas, what propaganda for our enemies that the imperialist America now wants to [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=220.96s)]
*  come over. But talk about it, because when we say Arab countries were upset, that used to be [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=227.6s)]
*  our enemies are upset. Now those Arab countries, those Sunni Arab countries, our close allies, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=234.56s)]
*  they were deeply shaken by this. And even the DHS had to send out, as you reported, a chilling warning [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=241.28s)]
*  about the possibility of terror strikes as a result of this change in posture. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=248.39999999999998s)]
*  So Joe, like Trump's tariff policies, what was shocking about this was that it was [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=254.95999999999998s)]
*  an assault on our closest friends and allies, Jordan and Egypt, which are the two countries [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=263.36s)]
*  that matter most in terms of the security of Israel. When the proposal was made, the reaction [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=269.92s)]
*  in the Arab world was immediate. People were on the phone. I'm told that Mohammed bin Salman, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=275.28000000000003s)]
*  the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, was talking yesterday to King Abdullah in Jordan, offering [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=280.32s)]
*  him assurance that Donald Trump is not going to roll us into supporting this proposal. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=286.40000000000003s)]
*  By midday, the reaction was so strong that you could see Trump through the White House spokesman [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=292.40000000000003s)]
*  backing away from some details of the plan. This had been announced as a takeover. We're going to [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=299.36s)]
*  take Gaza. We're going to take it with troops. But by midday, no, no boots on the ground. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=304.24s)]
*  The reality is that this is a crazy proposal, the idea that the United States would take over [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=310.32s)]
*  property in the most explosive, war-prone part of the world, and that a president who said, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=317.28000000000003s)]
*  I'm going to end Middle East wars, would be championing it. It just makes your head spin. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=323.6s)]
*  And it's likely that this isn't going anywhere. But is it the opening bid? The opening bid to what? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=327.76s)]
*  The truth is, a solution for Gaza. The president's right. Gaza looks like a demolition zone. I've [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=335.84s)]
*  seen it with my own eyes. Every building you see in every direction has been destroyed. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=341.76s)]
*  What's going to be done? If Trump's idea is a bad one, what's a good one? And there are lots of ideas [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=346.32s)]
*  out there. The Israelis have been resisting, many of the ones the U.S. has proposed. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=351.92s)]
*  If this is the opening of a real discussion about how you rebuild Gaza, so much the better. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=357.68s)]
*  But Trump's initial version of this was so disorienting for the region that it got a big [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=363.12s)]
*  pushback and I do think is going to be a fodder for terror groups that would like to inspire [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=370.40000000000003s)]
*  radical action in the United States. I did quote this morning a memo that was sent out in the early [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=377.92s)]
*  hours of yesterday morning by DHS noting the likelihood that there would be protest demonstrations [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=383.52000000000004s)]
*  around the country and that if they turn violent, people would have to deal with that. So I think [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=391.12s)]
*  already there's a sense that this may be triggering precisely the kind of threat [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=395.76s)]
*  within the homeland that we shouldn't be wanting. So David, let me ask you, if this was [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=400.88s)]
*  an attempt to just throw everybody off balance and set up an opening bid for something different, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=408.16s)]
*  because as the Wall Street Journal editorial page said, going back to the status quo with [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=414.72s)]
*  Hamas in charge certainly is not an option. That was this morning's Wall Street Journal [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=419.04s)]
*  editorial, lead editorial. So what is this an opening bid for? Is this an opening, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=425.04s)]
*  perhaps the Saudis, the Emiratis, the Jordanians, other people in the region coming in with [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=431.44s)]
*  an Arab peacekeeping force? What could this be an opening bid to? What could, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=437.28s)]
*  do you have any reporting on what Donald Trump was trying to get to? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=443.28s)]
*  So Donald Trump's vision, and this does go back many months and maybe even years, I had one senior [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=449.91999999999996s)]
*  Arab official say this is the deal of the century coming back. We're going back to Trump's first [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=456.79999999999995s)]
*  term and let's just turn over everything and start again with American leadership. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=464.24s)]
*  Maybe there are echoes of that. Certainly Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, was talking a year ago. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=469.52s)]
*  You can see him on tape at a Harvard seminar talking about the need to turn Gaza into a [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=474.24s)]
*  wonderful waterfront. He was talking about moving people out into the Negev Desert, which is in [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=480.56s)]
*  Israel, not to Egypt and Jordan. So this is an idea that's been cooking for Trump, but he does [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=485.68s)]
*  have a sort of real estate developer sense of here's opportunity, here's a demolition zone, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=491.68s)]
*  let's figure out a way to rebuild it. In terms of what would be a sane alternative, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=496.24s)]
*  the Biden administration, Secretary of State and National Security Advisor both have been pushing [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=503.68s)]
*  the idea that you need a day after in Gaza in which you gradually give the Palestinian authority [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=511.28000000000003s)]
*  more and more responsibility so that you have Palestinians who are vetted by Israel, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=518.0799999999999s)]
*  who have shown that they can handle security duties, being responsible there. I don't see [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=525.12s)]
*  a better way than that. That's not something Trump is sympathetic to, but he better start [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=530.4s)]
*  looking at it because I don't see another way. Yeah, David, clearly bringing a developer's [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=536.3199999999999s)]
*  mindset to the most fragile and fragmented foreign policy threat and debacle in the world. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=540.08s)]
*  Carlos, this was seemingly the one thing that Republicans knee-jerk reaction was to say, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=548.4000000000001s)]
*  this is crazy, insane, deranged. Those were actual quotes that we heard from Republicans and [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=552.8000000000001s)]
*  Democrats alike. Why is this the issue that they're willing to go to bat on against the [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=558.08s)]
*  administration? Is it because it just seems so out there that they feel like there's not a [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=563.44s)]
*  political tax? Well, number one, it's pretty obvious, right? And I think easy to dismiss. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=567.36s)]
*  It is a radical idea. To be fair, not more radical than having terrorists run Gaza, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=572.88s)]
*  but still a radical idea. And at the same time, it's inconsistent with what Trump has been telling [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=577.2s)]
*  congressional Republicans and the country for so long, right? That we should be investing in our [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=584.08s)]
*  own country, that we should withdraw from conflict zones, that we shouldn't put our men and women in [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=589.52s)]
*  harm's way. Well, putting people in Gaza seems pretty dangerous to me. So I think a lot of people [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=595.84s)]
*  on the Hill, and I was up there yesterday, were just kind of surprised that he would propose [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=601.2800000000001s)]
*  something that is so distant from the persona that he's created, from this idea that he's promoted, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=606.88s)]
*  that the United States should actually withdraw from the world stage. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVosUbmvO1Y&t=613.6s)]
