# Underwater: Trump's approval lower than Biden, Obama near 100-day mark
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA)
*  President Trump is planning to hold a rally in Michigan next week to mark his first 100 [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=0.0s)]
*  days in office in his second term. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=6.84s)]
*  According to the White House, on Tuesday Trump will travel to Macomb County, north of Detroit, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=9.56s)]
*  for the event. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=14.16s)]
*  It will be the president's first visit to the battleground state since winning the November [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=15.48s)]
*  election. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=21.32s)]
*  And speaking of his first 100 days, President Trump is making history, but it's maybe not [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=22.6s)]
*  the kind that he wants. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=28.88s)]
*  Fox News anchor Brett Baier reported on the president's sinking approval rating yesterday. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=30.48s)]
*  If you look at our new Fox News poll at 100 days job approval compared to other presidents, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=36.839999999999996s)]
*  there you see the president at 44 percent and you see his first term at 45 percent at [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=42.72s)]
*  this mark, the 100 day mark. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=48.96s)]
*  Well, let's dig into those new numbers. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  That new Fox News poll finds Trump's overall approval rating underwater with 44 percent [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=54.24s)]
*  approving and 55 percent disapproving. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=59.6s)]
*  The president is also underwater on the issues that really were key to his campaign, immigration, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=64.4s)]
*  foreign policy, the economy, tariffs and inflation. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=71.08s)]
*  He ran on most of those. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=75.88s)]
*  Based on Trump's first 100 days, voters are also less optimistic about the future. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=77.56s)]
*  Thirty eight percent say they feel encouraged about the next four years, while 51 percent [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=83.84s)]
*  are discouraged. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=89.8s)]
*  Mike Barnicle still with us and join the conversation we have the host of Way Too Early, Ali Vitale, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=99.16s)]
*  co-host of the weekend primetime MSNBC contributor Elise Jordan and deputy opinion editor at [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=104.84s)]
*  The New York Times, Patrick Healy. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=111.53999999999999s)]
*  We'll get to what you're writing about in just a moment, but Willie, those numbers, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=114.42s)]
*  as reported by a Fox News poll, pretty stark. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=118.69999999999999s)]
*  And the Fox News poll is actually more generous than some of the others that came out yesterday. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=122.89999999999999s)]
*  Pew has the president at a 40 percent approval rating, also historically low at this point. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=126.61999999999999s)]
*  And importantly on the economy, Reuters has him at 37 percent. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=132.5s)]
*  So it turns out, Elise, if you take an economy that was in most ways, not always, except [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=136.22s)]
*  for inflation, was humming along and you aggressively tank it with tariffs and other [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=141.3s)]
*  actions, voters, including Republicans, don't like it very much. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=146.94s)]
*  Well, and an economy that in January and February, before all of the tariff nonsense came on [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=150.98000000000002s)]
*  the scene, was doing quite well and was enthusiastic about Trump's presidency and optimistic. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=156.86s)]
*  And you see how quickly the sugar high of just the first 100 days is over now that voters [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=162.9s)]
*  are actually seeing what kind of results or lack thereof are coming into play. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=168.58s)]
*  Yeah, people really believe that the businessman president would figure out a way very quickly [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=173.70000000000002s)]
*  to drive the economy in a different direction. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=179.22000000000003s)]
*  And he set that expectation on day one, this talk of the golden age of economy and inflation [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=181.84s)]
*  would go down. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=186.94s)]
*  Even though we're very used to the rhetoric by now, he still set a bar for himself that [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=187.94s)]
*  he had no policy to get over. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=192.46s)]
*  And Mike Barnicle, he's got more of an infrastructure, let's put it this way, in the White House [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=195.02s)]
*  to follow through on the promises that he made during the campaign. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=203.18s)]
*  For example, the incredibly unpopular tariffs. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=207.78s)]
*  But wouldn't that lead to the ultimate question? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=211.74s)]
*  He might have better infrastructure this time out. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=214.26000000000002s)]
*  But the level of incompetence is still there. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=217.74s)]
*  And the fact that it all revolves around him, what he thinks on a moment to moment basis. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=221.58s)]
*  And you watch Republicans, you watch Democrats, the collective political group looking at [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=229.10000000000002s)]
*  all of the issues, I would submit most Republicans, most Democrats in the House and Senate pay [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=234.98000000000002s)]
*  more attention to policy on a daily basis than does the president of the United States [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=239.82000000000002s)]
*  because the policy that he thinks about is him. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=244.70000000000002s)]
*  The selfishness pathway. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=248.02s)]
*  And it's stuck in the 1980s too, frankly. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=250.73999999999998s)]
*  He's still talking about Japan and living in a world where he is fearful of the Japanese [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=254.22s)]
*  recession hitting America. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=260.46s)]
*  These ideas are antiquated. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=262.7s)]
*  There's a reason that we have moved beyond. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=264.1s)]
*  There's a reason that all of the leading economists are saying, you're leading us into not just [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=266.21999999999997s)]
*  a recession, a Great Depression. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=270.78s)]
*  It reminds me of the run up to the Iraq War, frankly, when you have a lot of voices, a [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=273.3s)]
*  lot of military experts, a lot of national security experts saying it wasn't going to [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=277.98s)]
*  be as easy as was predicted by some of the rosier outlooks. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=281.9s)]
*  And sometimes the experts can be right. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=286.34s)]
*  Part of what's so strange about President Trump is that one thing that he did for a [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=289.1s)]
*  while have in common with Reagan and Clinton and Obama is that he seemed to have some feel [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=293.34s)]
*  and understanding for the electorate. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=298.46s)]
*  And he was winning over working class voters, middle class voters. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=300.34s)]
*  He taps into issues that really work. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=304.06s)]
*  He does. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=306.06s)]
*  He does. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=307.06s)]
*  He does. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=308.06s)]
*  But he does have his economy policies that put the squeeze on those voters. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=309.06s)]
*  He doesn't seem to understand the pain that Clinton did or the way that it hits in the [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=310.82s)]
*  pocketbook like Reagan did. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=315.42s)]
*  Well, and also if you look at some of these poll numbers, and I think they're poll numbers. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=316.82s)]
*  That's all they are. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=320.62s)]
*  But you just wonder if even what's happening with this immigration policy, if the bulk [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=321.86s)]
*  of Americans are really OK with what is happening with these forced removals, these people who [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=329.22s)]
*  don't get the process of deportation but are being whisked away, chained and sent to the [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=335.58s)]
*  worst prison in El Salvador and sent to a different country to a horrific place where [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=342.34s)]
*  they will either be tortured or starved or will die. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=347.38s)]
*  Like I'm thinking that might be breaking through to the base a little bit. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=351.3s)]
*  But who, you know, the polls might be implying that a little bit. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=355.74s)]
*  We shall see. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=359.1s)]
*  I might take the other side of that because the one area where his numbers seem to be [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=360.1s)]
*  holding a bit is on immigration. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=366.14000000000004s)]
*  And look, we've had all these big moments in the first 100 days. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=369.58000000000004s)]
*  I think one of the big moments for the rest of the year is what you're getting at, Mika, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=373.06s)]
*  it's whether Americans ultimately revolt and speak out if they start seeing detention camps [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=376.42s)]
*  or mass deportations. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=384.18s)]
*  I find we might see, frankly, more tolerance for some of that than we expect. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=385.66s)]
*  We did this focus group the other night and immigration with Frank Luntz. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=391.34000000000003s)]
*  Immigration was the one issue that these Democrats turned Trump supporters in November are still [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=395.34000000000003s)]
*  with him. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=401.02000000000004s)]
*  They still want to see this kind of action. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=402.02000000000004s)]
*  It's the shiny object. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=404.22s)]
*  I want to know why. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=405.22s)]
*  Tell me more about that. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=408.34000000000003s)]
*  Still the sense of the sort of the loss of control that they felt that Joe Biden as a [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=409.34000000000003s)]
*  kind of an older president didn't have his arms around the border, didn't take it seriously. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=414.42s)]
*  And sort of still the belief that even if the businessman president isn't doing right [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=421.82s)]
*  on the economy, that the numbers are down on border crossing. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=426.46s)]
*  Sort of the sense that someone is taking this seriously. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=430.7s)]
*  What the most surprising thing is that those images of students being snatched off sidewalks [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=434.54s)]
*  by mass agents, we sort of thought there might be some kind of more emotional kind of a response [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=440.74s)]
*  or issue there. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=447.18s)]
*  But the sense was that that President Trump is taking this sort of very seriously and [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=448.62s)]
*  he's willing to pay some kind of a price. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=454.3s)]
*  We also did this conversation with Democratic leaders who were involved in President Clinton's [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=456.94000000000005s)]
*  campaign back in 92. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=462.02000000000004s)]
*  And they also identified immigration as the area that the party, the Democratic Party, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=463.82000000000005s)]
*  really needs to have a bigger fight over. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=470.1s)]
*  That a lot of Democratic leaders still don't understand where a lot of Americans are on [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=472.9s)]
*  this, that they want to see something more dramatic. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=478.42s)]
*  Really interesting insights. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=480.78s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1FllPQJRA&t=482.26s)]
