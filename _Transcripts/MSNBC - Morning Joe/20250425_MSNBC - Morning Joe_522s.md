# Revelation from TIME interview: Trump says promise to end Ukraine war on day one was in jest
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [April 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM)
*  We have crossed to the top of the hour 702 here in New York closing in on the first 100 days of President Trump's second [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=0.0s)]
*  Term in office this morning time is out with an exclusive interview with the commander-in-chief [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=6.7s)]
*  Where the president discusses a range of topics from his administration? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  Following court orders to the future of Ukraine join us now on morning [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=16.6s)]
*  Joe for the first broadcast discussion of that interview senior political correspondent at time Eric Corda Lessa [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=21.54s)]
*  He was part of the team conducting the interview with President Trump also with us NBC News and MSNBC [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=27.92s)]
*  Political analyst former US Senator Claire McCaskill. Good morning to you both. So Eric, I'll start with you [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=33.96s)]
*  You spent about an hour in the room with the president. What was your headline coming out of it? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=39.82s)]
*  Well, I think you know, you know, my main impression was that you know, the last two times I spoke with President Trump [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  He was in a very sort of triumphant setting, you know [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=50.7s)]
*  Either he was on pace to you know beat Joe Biden in the election or he had just won the presidency in this instance [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=53.56s)]
*  You know, he's now confronted with the challenges of governing [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=60.24s)]
*  I think you know a couple of big things came out of the interview, you know for one [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=63.5s)]
*  I think Donald Trump provided some insight into his view about the tariffs specifically when you know [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=67.78s)]
*  We asked whether or not he would consider it a victory if we still had high tariffs on foreign imports a year from now [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=74.14s)]
*  As high as you know 20% 30% 50% he called it a total victory [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=79.54s)]
*  So, you know, I think that he's not planning to necessarily back down on the tariffs [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=85.66000000000001s)]
*  he did say that he had spoken with she more than once since he [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=90.0s)]
*  Announced his tariffs and that there were talks ongoing between his administration the Chinese Chinese [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=96.18s)]
*  deny that but you know, the Trump administration says they're embarking on talks and are optimistic for a deal he said he had [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=102.78s)]
*  200 deals that were inked at one point but didn't say when they would be announced [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=109.11999999999999s)]
*  You know a number of other very newsy items that came out of the interview [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=114.38s)]
*  But those are just a couple of the of the main ones. Yeah, Eric [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=117.82s)]
*  It's a very all-encompassing interview and congratulations for pushing back on several things clearly [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=121.13999999999999s)]
*  But you just mentioned the deals aspect that he's made 200 deals already and you ask him [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=127.24s)]
*  When are you going to announce them? Well not time [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=131.94s)]
*  How did you handle this throughout that entire interview on each and every topic there was discrepancies between reality and what the president is telling you [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=134.54s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you know [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=144.42s)]
*  Just kept asking him [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=147.06s)]
*  As much as I could, you know what the what he was doing. What was he's going to do? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=149.06s)]
*  I think you know, there's a very sort of telling sequence particularly when we spoke about [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=153.57999999999998s)]
*  Complying with court orders, you know President Trump, you know as I asked him, you know why he was not [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=158.94s)]
*  Facilitating the release of Kilmar Obrego Garcia despite the Supreme Court's ruling [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=166.22s)]
*  You know his answer was that his lawyers are telling him that that is not what the Supreme Court ruling says [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=170.24s)]
*  You know, I read for him the ruling [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=177.26s)]
*  He still disputed it when I asked whether or not he had asked President Bukele of El Salvador [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=179.42s)]
*  To facilitate his release or to bring him back. He said that he hadn't asked him positively and so, you know throughout the interview [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=185.58s)]
*  I mean I found that Trump was [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=192.22s)]
*  You know more evasive more cantankerous than he has been in the past throughout the interview [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=194.26s)]
*  you know, he's very you know gracious at other points as well, but [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=199.72s)]
*  You know, it was it was always you know involved pushing back as much as he could to try and get an answer from him [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=203.86s)]
*  So Eric, I want to continue on that a brego Garcia conversation stood out to me [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=210.54s)]
*  It's fascinating you all asked him couldn't you just bring him back and try him here if you believe that he's a member of a gang [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=214.64s)]
*  If you believe that he's committed crimes and the president said you could bring him back. That's exactly right [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=221.0s)]
*  You could fix this simply by bringing him back and going through the legal process [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=226.27999999999997s)]
*  But I leave that decision to the lawyers which seemed to be an answer throughout this section of your conversation [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=229.95999999999998s)]
*  It's up to my lawyers. It's up to my lawyers and he says and they don't want to do that right now [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=235.44s)]
*  It sort of defies [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=240.07999999999998s)]
*  Credibility that he could not just call the president of El Salvador and say we need this guy back [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=242.44000000000003s)]
*  And if we think he's a criminal we'll put him on trial. They've admitted [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=247.48000000000002s)]
*  They said it was a mistake an administrative error, but it did sound a little softer than I've heard him before saying [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=250.76000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I guess we could bring him back and try him but that's up to my lawyers [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=257.04s)]
*  Yeah, I think he really you know reverted to that answer over and over again during this sequence of the conversation that it's up to [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=260.84000000000003s)]
*  My lawyers my lawyers have told me that's not what the ruling says my lawyers told me I don't have to do that [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=268.16s)]
*  So I think he was advised at some point to say that anytime he was asked on the subject and you know [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=272.88000000000005s)]
*  He was pretty persistent in holding that line. All right, Claire McCaskill's got a question for you Claire [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=279.58000000000004s)]
*  So on a related subject matter, I'm curious. What is your sense about this pending? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=285.8s)]
*  Confrontation with the judges writ large he is losing in court [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=292.96s)]
*  I think Trump appointed judges have ruled against him more than 60% of the time [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=297.36s)]
*  Which is a huge mark for Trump appointed judges ruling against the president [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=303.32s)]
*  Do you sense that he has the gravity of the situation in front of mind that he is in a position to really? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=309.28s)]
*  Put our country in a constitutional crisis that we've never seen before or is he just brushing it off and [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=317.68s)]
*  acting as if this business is usual with a bunch of [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=323.56s)]
*  scallywags on the bench [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=326.76s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't get the sense that that president Trump thinks we're heading toward a constitutional crisis that he's precipitated [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=329.88s)]
*  I think he thinks that you know, the judges are [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=337.4s)]
*  Trying to stand in his way from him being able to implement his agenda [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=342.08s)]
*  You know both him and you know senior advisors to President Trump both [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=346.04s)]
*  You know, they all complained to me in conversations that there were regional judges who were you know? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=349.72s)]
*  Trying to usurp his authority on foreign policy and that they would fight back as vigorously as possible [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=355.48s)]
*  So I think you know Trump basically sees these judges [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=360.6s)]
*  As a nuisance who are standing in his way for that [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=364.24s)]
*  You know standing his way for him a being able to enact the policies that he campaigned on, you know [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=368.32s)]
*  He says this is exactly what I said I was gonna do during the campaign [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=373.68s)]
*  I said I was gonna deport people I said I was gonna do all the things that I'm doing and [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=377.08s)]
*  You know, he's basically saying he's not gonna let [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=381.56s)]
*  Judges stand in the way said by the way [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=384.88s)]
*  He did say he would comply with Supreme Court orders and he said he would comply with lower court orders [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=387.36s)]
*  Obviously, he has challenged the lower courts. He called for Judge Boasberg to be impeached and [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=391.76s)]
*  As we've seen from this case involving Kilmar Obrego Garcia [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=398.2s)]
*  He hasn't moved to try to bring this man back [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=402.20000000000005s)]
*  So, you know, we'll see where it goes from here [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=405.28000000000003s)]
*  But I think Trump basically sees these judges as an impediment [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=407.52000000000004s)]
*  But he doesn't seem all too fazed about the consequences that he thinks may follow [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=411.76000000000005s)]
*  Eric was there any sense of frustration on the part of the president? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=417.40000000000003s)]
*  He said he was gonna end the war in crane in a day the quarry didn't do that [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=421.56s)]
*  He said he's gonna fix the economy just like that [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=425.44000000000005s)]
*  Of course the economy hadn't been fixed and in fact we may be in a recession [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=428.03999999999996s)]
*  That he seems to have brought on was there any frustration that he hasn't been able to deliver on a lot of things [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=434.32s)]
*  He promised you know, it's interesting because I asked about the Ukraine thing [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=442.03999999999996s)]
*  I said, you know president Trump you said you would solve this issue in a day, you know, what's going on? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=444.91999999999996s)]
*  And you know, he said oh, I said that in jest Eric everybody knew that that was you know symbolic [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=449.24s)]
*  I wasn't really saying it was I was gonna get it done in a day. This has been going on for three years [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=455.16s)]
*  I've only been here in three months. So, you know, I sensed that there was some frustration on his part [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=459.24s)]
*  And I also think you know, he pulled back on that claim that he would be able to solve the war in 24 hours [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=464.6s)]
*  You know, of course, he's not wrong that it's a very complicated. He's not wrong now [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=470.84000000000003s)]
*  That's a very complicated issue and it's hard to solve and he's gotten tractable players, you know in Vladimir Putin [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=474.36s)]
*  But you know, I do think no this is a different moment for him than the last time [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=480.56s)]
*  You know, I spoke with him because you know, he is right now facing all of these these problems that you're talking about [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=485.84s)]
*  Senior political correspondent at time Eric corda Lessa. Thank you that exclusive interview [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=492.28s)]
*  In time available now to read online Eric. Thanks so much [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=497.44s)]
*  You [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzlqjCDbfFM&t=510.44s)]
