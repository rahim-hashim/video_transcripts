# 'We do not disappear people': Sen. Warren slams Trump WH over Abrego Garcia deportation
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s)
*  First, I would like to ask about these deportations. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=0.0s)]
*  We were just watching the White House continue to double down on this one specific case, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=3.24s)]
*  Mr. Abrigo Garcia, and to an extent really trying to label him a terrorist. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=9.36s)]
*  But all the others are legally questionable as well. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=17.28s)]
*  Your thoughts? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=19.68s)]
*  But the point is, why are they doing this? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=20.68s)]
*  And the answer is, they want to have the American people say, it's OK to just disappear people. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=23.32s)]
*  And somehow they think if they can make up lies about him, if they can do whatever they want, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=29.959999999999997s)]
*  then the answer will be the American people will settle for this. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=35.16s)]
*  We do not disappear people in the United States. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=38.12s)]
*  Because here's the thing, if they can disappear Mr. Abrigo Garcia, then they can disappear you. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=41.8s)]
*  And do you want to know who else says that? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=48.96s)]
*  Hillary Clinton, who posted that this is real. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=51.72s)]
*  She was sounding the alarm long before the election about his promises that he is following through on before the election. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=55.08s)]
*  I warned that there is no safe haven under authoritarianism. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=63.239999999999995s)]
*  They can ship Kilmar Abrigo Garcia to a foreign prison, a gulag really, accused of no crime with no trial. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=67.24s)]
*  They can do it to anyone. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=73.75999999999999s)]
*  Americans of conscience must stand against this now. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=74.96s)]
*  Do you think this will break through, Senator? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=78.64s)]
*  So I think it is breaking through. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=82.44000000000001s)]
*  I think there are just places where Americans say enough of this. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=85.56s)]
*  When Chuck Grassley goes out to a town hall and people are just saying, well, wait a minute, what's going on here? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=90.0s)]
*  And now it's both halves. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=97.04s)]
*  It's about disappearing people, but it's also about obeying court orders. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=98.36000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=103.36000000000001s)]
*  And we have these pieces, we all learn them in 10th grade history, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=103.88000000000001s)]
*  and we know what the pieces are supposed to be about how our country works. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=108.72s)]
*  But now we've got is truly a man who threatens it, a spineless bunch of Republicans in the House and Senate who help it along. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=113.4s)]
*  And the American people saying, wait a minute, I think this is the moment we're going to have to start fighting back for our country. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=123.4s)]
*  So here's what I've got to pose this question to you, Elizabeth. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=130.96s)]
*  First of all, it's great to see you. Good to see you. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=134.96s)]
*  Tell all my friends there. I said, hello. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=136.72s)]
*  We'll do. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=138.24s)]
*  Everywhere I go, what's happened is, as usual, Trump has taken over the media space in a way that is overwhelming. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=139.12s)]
*  And in that moment, there are millions of Americans that are depressed, frustrated, anxious, very emotional about what's going on. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=148.68s)]
*  They turn on the news or they open their TikTok and all they see is the Trump stuff. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  They're not seeing the Democratic counter. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=167.52s)]
*  And so everywhere I go, people grab me and go, why aren't the Democrats doing more? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=171.56s)]
*  What's wrong with the Democratic messaging? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=176.8s)]
*  Why aren't they out there in the streets? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=178.56s)]
*  What's what's going on with the Democratic senators and House members? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=180.84s)]
*  So this is your opportunity. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=184.36s)]
*  I want you to explain to all the people what you are actually doing and why it is harder than it looks to dominate airspace in light of all the crap that's going on in the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=186.04000000000002s)]
*  Oval Office. So, you know, let's do constitutional law 101. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=197.44s)]
*  We've got Congress. We're supposed to make the laws. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=201.56s)]
*  The administration is supposed to administer those laws. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=204.92s)]
*  The courts are supposed to enforce those laws. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=207.84s)]
*  A big part of what's going on right now is that we are doubling down on the Constitution. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=210.32s)]
*  So all the places where Donald Trump is breaking the law, it's in the courts. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=216.2s)]
*  We've got over 100 lawsuits that are going forward in the courts. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=221.48s)]
*  That really is the right thing for us to do. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=224.79999999999998s)]
*  Second thing we're doing is we do the things that are appropriate for Congress. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=227.2s)]
*  So, for example, Donald Trump is out here with the tariffs saying, oh, it's going to be a 57 percent tariff. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=231.39999999999998s)]
*  It's going to be a 10 percent tariff. It's going to be a hundred and forty five percent tariff. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=237.56s)]
*  Markets are doing this. Where does he get the power to do that? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=241.48s)]
*  That's supposed to be with Congress. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=245.84s)]
*  Well, the power he's using is an emergency authority that says specifically Congress, of course, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=247.48s)]
*  can say, hey, there's no emergency. We're not in an emergency with Belgium. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=254.48s)]
*  We're not in an emergency with South Korea. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=258.52s)]
*  Congress can then just roll that back. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=261.32s)]
*  So I've introduced the bill along with Senator Wyden, and there will be a vote. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=264.32s)]
*  This is one of those, you know, privileged motion. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=270.8s)]
*  There will be a vote in the next couple of weeks where every Democrat is ready to roll that authority back from Donald Trump. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=273.68s)]
*  The question is, can we get some Republicans? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=283.12s)]
*  But here's the deal. And here's the importance of this. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=285.24s)]
*  Every Republican will be required to go on the record and to say quite publicly while things are crashing about them, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=288.35999999999996s)]
*  either they are there only to bow down to Donald Trump or they are there to stand up for the people who elected them to stand up for our country. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=296.84s)]
*  And you just got to force them into those votes. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=308.76s)]
*  What do you think the count is? You got six Republicans, maybe seven? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=311.56s)]
*  So I think the count is in our favor for a majority. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=315.2s)]
*  But here's the importance of it. I think it's going to be the crack in the wall. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=321.2s)]
*  Yep. As soon as they start to move and as soon as you've got more than one moving, seven after a little bit starts to look like 17. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=325.36s)]
*  People don't want to be caught on the wrong side of history. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=334.6s)]
*  And here's the thing. You know this, Claire, there's a long time when things go wrong, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=337.24s)]
*  Republicans and Democrats in the elevator down on the floor of the Senate, back in the cloakroom, they say to each other, we got a little problem here. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=342.28s)]
*  Now, no one wants to meet your eye, Claire. Right. Well, nobody from the Republicans. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=350.8s)]
*  They just it's heads down. And when you say what's happening in the market, it's just heads down. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=356.15999999999997s)]
*  That's so awkward. They know. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=361.56s)]
*  But the point is, they do know and they understand. Look, I have no sympathy here. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=363.64s)]
*  They are in the box. They want to be a Republican. That is the damn box you've put yourself in. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=370.91999999999996s)]
*  But you're going to have to make a decision. Is it bow down to Trump or stand up for the American people? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=376.8s)]
*  You know, off of Claire's initial question to you, what do the Democrats do when combating what I would call the theater of [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=382.76s)]
*  planned cruelty by the Trump administration? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=393.48s)]
*  It's no accident in my mind that Mr. Abreu Garcia looks the way he looks and doesn't look the way I look or the way you look. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=397.40000000000003s)]
*  They plan these things and clearly have planned them for quite some time. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=406.12s)]
*  And it seems to me that there's no really tough, almost gangster like response from the Democrats about what's going on. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=411.24s)]
*  Because ultimately, that's not who we are. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=420.52s)]
*  Well, you better step it up then. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=423.96s)]
*  Well, but this is the difference. Look, because it's happening everywhere. There is a pattern here. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=426.68s)]
*  I know it feels like a dust storm, but watch what's happening back in Congress. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=431.71999999999997s)]
*  They're moving forward every step, taking every step to do what? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=436.84s)]
*  To be able to do giant tax giveaways for billionaires and pay for it, Hal, on the backs of cutting social security, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=440.91999999999996s)]
*  cutting our promises to our veterans, cutting health care for little babies, taking away support for our public schools, for our kids with special needs. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=448.8s)]
*  They think they can get away with that. Our job is to get out. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=458.88s)]
*  Here's our secret plan. We'll tell everyone right now. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=463.72s)]
*  It's tell the truth, because the American people, this is so damned unpopular. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=467.28000000000003s)]
*  I get it. It's not as good theater, but it is unpopular. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=472.24s)]
*  Why is Chuck Grassley, why is Marjorie Taylor Greene facing people? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=476.6s)]
*  Why is the Republican leadership in Congress saying, don't go out and do town halls? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=481.28000000000003s)]
*  Because what you're doing is so miserably unpopular that people will scream at you and there'll be video of you running away. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=487.04s)]
*  Could you list the number of cancers that might be cured, the number of diseases that might be cured if they don't cut off the funding like the schools of public health? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=494.36s)]
*  I'm ready to do this because this really is. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=506.52000000000004s)]
*  You tell me who is better off for the Trump administration and his co-president, Elon Musk, to come through with this chainsaw and to cut off cancer research? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=509.12s)]
*  Are you kidding me? Tuberculosis research? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=520.08s)]
*  Really? Who is better off? Because those diseases don't just hit Democrats, baby. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=522.76s)]
*  They hit Democrats, Republicans and independents. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=528.36s)]
*  It is the reminder we make these investments because we believe in the dignity of every human being and trying to create opportunity for every one of them. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=531.64s)]
*  Republicans want to fight them, fight us on that. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=542.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm ready. I'm ready for that fight. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=545.6800000000001s)]
*  Senator, the through line in all of these stories to me as we debate, is it malice or incompetence? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=547.96s)]
*  Is that incompetence? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=554.72s)]
*  No, I think this one's malice. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=556.28s)]
*  But I also most generously want to make the point that even if we grant a certain innocence of intent, incompetence could also be malice. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=558.24s)]
*  If you're swimming and you're drowning and the lifeguard actually doesn't know how to save you, if you're relying on the Defense Department to not be on a single group chat, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=568.6s)]
*  on an economic advisor to have a sense of how this goes for the market, all of that is horrifying. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=576.6s)]
*  And then I look at these rallies that Bernie Sanders and AOC are staging and I'm wondering, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=584.32s)]
*  what do you do with that energy level from that wing of your party in response to people who are feeling malice, incompetence, the pain in a way that is visceral and quite obviously real? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=591.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So it's a great question. I'm sorry I didn't mean to jump in quite so fast on it, but I feel so strongly about this. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=603.6400000000001s)]
*  You are right. It's malice. It's malice at every level. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=610.0s)]
*  You turn someone like Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, loose metaphorically with a chainsaw. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=614.08s)]
*  Here's a man who wants to cut access to Social Security, can't officially do it because you'd have to go to Congress and Congress isn't going to vote for that, not even with a Republican majority. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=621.72s)]
*  So what do they do? They take the end run and they cut the number of people who work there. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=633.2800000000001s)]
*  They close the offices because that means the number of errors will go up. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=638.32s)]
*  People who just I got contacted my office just the other day. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=642.96s)]
*  Someone has an adult son with autism, gets a check from Social Security disability to help take care of him. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=646.7600000000001s)]
*  He just disappeared from the system. How do you get that corrected if there's nobody there on the other end? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=657.4000000000001s)]
*  So cut, cut, cut is what they're trying to do. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=664.04s)]
*  A man who makes eight million dollars a day just from his government contracts wants to cut access for people who are making sixty five dollars a day on Social Security. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=667.96s)]
*  So my view on this is people get this. They get it, whether they're Democrats, Republicans or independents. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=683.64s)]
*  The question you ask is what are we going to do with this energy? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=691.04s)]
*  And I think this is the moment. I think the energy is starting to roil. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=693.88s)]
*  It is starting to boil. For some people, it's going to be Social Security that finally brings them out. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=698.32s)]
*  For others, it's going to be the attacks on our public schools. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=704.32s)]
*  For others, it's going to be what they're doing to our veterans administration and the tariffs. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=708.28s)]
*  Remember, they're going to hit everybody because they're going to raise costs, they're going to drive up inflation and they're going to drive up unemployment. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=714.6s)]
*  So this is going to be one of those where what we're really going to see, I do my constitutional law 101, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=723.48s)]
*  but all of it is resting on the foundation of the consent of the people. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=731.16s)]
*  And people are starting to say, look, Donald Trump ran for office saying I will lower your costs on day one. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=738.76s)]
*  Remember, as soon as he gets elected, first thing he says is the reason I got elected is because I promised to lower costs. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=747.72s)]
*  Two months in, he's told about the tariffs that could raise costs for families. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=755.76s)]
*  And his remark is he, quote, couldn't care less. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=760.48s)]
*  Well, he's telling people he doesn't care about them. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=765.92s)]
*  He's not following through on their promises. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=768.36s)]
*  I think we're starting to feel the energy come back in the other direction. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=771.36s)]
*  We'll be part of this. There are going to be a lot of different pieces to it, but the energy is there. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SLJn9F55s&t=775.48s)]
