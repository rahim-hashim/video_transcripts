# ‘This is going to be a showdown’: Split rulings test Trump’s executive power on immigration
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk)
*  An appeals court panel has ruled President Trump can maintain control over California's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=0.0s)]
*  National Guard troops in Los Angeles amid anti-immigration enforcement protests, rejecting [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Governor Gavin Newsom's attempt to take back power. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=12.56s)]
*  The three judges of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled unanimously that Trump appeared [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=16.16s)]
*  to have acted within his authority when he took control of 4,000 troops under a law that [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=21.66s)]
*  has never been invoked without the consent of a state governor. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=28.04s)]
*  The court said it disagreed with the White House's stance that the president's decision [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=32.22s)]
*  is completely insulated from judicial review, but argued the office of the president carries [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=36.4s)]
*  unusual weight in the matter. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=42.84s)]
*  Newsom expressed disappointment in the ruling while State Attorney General Rob Bonta said [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=45.64s)]
*  in a statement the case is far from over. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=51.08s)]
*  Trump weighed in on social media calling it a great decision for the country. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=53.68s)]
*  Separately, a federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from forcing 20 Democratic-led [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=58.56s)]
*  states to cooperate with ICE in order to receive billions of dollars in transportation funding. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=65.32s)]
*  In April, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy notified states they could lose funding if [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=73.08s)]
*  they did not cooperate with immigration enforcement officers sparking lawsuits from 20 states. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=78.6s)]
*  But a chief district judge in Rhode Island ruled yesterday the department lacked authority [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=84.96s)]
*  to require states to cooperate to obtain the money and that the White House provided no [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=91.0s)]
*  plausible connection to the purposes intended for the funding, which is to support highways [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=96.67999999999999s)]
*  and bridges and other projects. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=102.24s)]
*  So Sam Stein, your thoughts? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=106.4s)]
*  Well there's obviously a big win for Trump in one case and a fairly substantial loss [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=109.12s)]
*  in another. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=114.28s)]
*  And I guess the larger picture here is that if you just step back and you look at all [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=115.28s)]
*  the levers of government that Trump is using, all the resources he's putting through to [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=120.28s)]
*  put together this massive deportation regime, it's really striking. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=126.64000000000001s)]
*  the governor's will is an extraordinary use of power. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=132.32s)]
*  Trying to leverage federal funds is remarkable. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=136.84s)]
*  And I guess I'd ask Lisa Rubin, I mean this latter case on the transportation funding, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=140.88s)]
*  Lisa, is this just going to be limited to transportation funding or does the federal [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=145.68s)]
*  judge's ruling have any applicability to other federal funds? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=149.92s)]
*  In other words, can Trump turn around and say, okay fine, I'll restrict some health [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=154.79999999999998s)]
*  care funds from a state then? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=157.72s)]
*  I think Sam, you can take it as a warning sign, but one that doesn't necessarily have [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  direct application to other agencies, especially since this is just a single decision of a [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=164.0s)]
*  district judge in Rhode Island with respect to that particular case before him involving [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=170.32s)]
*  Secretary Duffy and the fact that these states weren't as cooperative as the administration [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=175.79999999999998s)]
*  wants them to be with ICE enforcement. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=181.35999999999999s)]
*  So if I were the administration, I'd take it as a little bit of a warning sign, but [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=183.42s)]
*  not necessarily a blanket disapproval for the larger strategy of trying to condition [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=187.56s)]
*  funding and other areas on immigration enforcement cooperation. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=193.96s)]
*  You know, Lisa, it seems there is an axis in both of these cases, even though the decision's [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=199.4s)]
*  handed down by different courts. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=204.96s)]
*  You had the three-judge panel saying that the president had authority as it pertained [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=208.12s)]
*  to the National Guard, a good bit of authority, and the justification was to protect federal [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=214.96s)]
*  law enforcement officers and also to protect federal buildings. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=221.79999999999998s)]
*  So there's that nexus there, and I suspect the Supreme Court will likely uphold that [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=225.2s)]
*  decision. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=232.2s)]
*  On the other side of it, though, you have funding for roads, bridges, and airports being [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=233.2s)]
*  held up because of decisions states make regarding immigration and their relationship to ICE. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=241.68s)]
*  Not that clear nexus there. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=249.6s)]
*  Is that how we should look at these two cases? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=251.24s)]
*  Not necessarily, although I can understand why you're looking at it that way. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=254.04s)]
*  Joe, one of the things that differentiates these two cases is that in the case of Trump's [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=257.71999999999997s)]
*  decision to federalize the National Guard, there was a statute that he called upon and [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=262.58s)]
*  invoked in order to do that in a June 7 presidential memorandum that then empowered Secretary [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=267.32s)]
*  Hegseth to call up the National Guard when he determined that through usual forces or [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=272.96s)]
*  regular forces, the president was unable to execute the laws of the United States. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=280.84s)]
*  That is that particular provision of the statute that Trump was relying upon, not the part [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=286.03999999999996s)]
*  that says that you can call them up in the instance of a rebellion or an invasion or [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=291.05999999999995s)]
*  a danger of one of those two. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=296.06s)]
*  So in that respect, that is somewhat of a victory, too, for Governor Newsom. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=297.66s)]
*  You don't have this appeals court saying, oh, there's a rebellion or an invasion, and [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=302.42s)]
*  of course we should grant deference to that decision. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=306.02000000000004s)]
*  But more globally, the bigger picture difference between the two is you've got a congressionally [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=308.54s)]
*  enacted statute, one that's been in place for decades, saying that the president can [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=314.70000000000005s)]
*  do this. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=318.98s)]
*  In the instance involving the Secretary of Transportation, there was nothing that empowered [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=320.14000000000004s)]
*  Sean Duffy to make that determination. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=324.94s)]
*  In fact, that was what the court sort of rested on, that you don't have this authority to [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=327.17999999999995s)]
*  take already appropriated funds in your context and condition it on something that Congress [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=332.17999999999995s)]
*  didn't say it was dependent on in the first place. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=338.26s)]
*  Well, and the other thing you used the word globally is that, you know, before we were [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=340.9s)]
*  talking about Iran, our focus was on Los Angeles and what was happening in the streets there. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=346.41999999999996s)]
*  This decision, in essence, gives Trumps the green light to use the National Guard in other [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=351.62s)]
*  states, and the administration has been hinting very publicly that they're going to go into [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=356.18s)]
*  New York City, Chicago, maybe some other states, all happen to be blue. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=360.46s)]
*  What is the mood like, Elizabeth, that you sense from talking to lawmakers, state officials, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=366.38s)]
*  about where this goes from here now that the president does have the legal green light [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=372.62s)]
*  to use the National Guard? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=376.06s)]
*  I can tell you that in New York City, if he deploys the National Guard in New York, there [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=377.06s)]
*  will be, it'll cause, it's going to cause a giant outrage and create probably more violence [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=380.94s)]
*  than there would be anyway. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=390.78s)]
*  Isn't that what he wants? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=392.02s)]
*  Well, that's the office, that's of course one of the working theories that he wants [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=393.26s)]
*  to, you know, create this all over the country and then, you know, declare martial law. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=397.38s)]
*  I mean, there's no sign that that's, we're close to that, but that's one of the fears [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=403.34s)]
*  you hear from Democrats, you know. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=406.54s)]
*  And I also want to say, just talking about the Sean Duffy case, let's not forget what [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=409.1s)]
*  happened in Maine, where the Trump administration froze funding for a child nutrition program [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=413.90000000000003s)]
*  in Maine because Maine was not, it was allowing transgender youth to compete in sports. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=422.26s)]
*  And that was stopped. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=428.86s)]
*  But that's another example of, again, the Trump administration trying to use anything [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=430.3s)]
*  in its powers to advance its policies. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=435.22s)]
*  So, Lisa, a question from David Ignatius in Washington. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=438.78000000000003s)]
*  What are these two cases and all the whole range of legal action that's going on now? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=444.02000000000004s)]
*  Tell you about where we're heading in the showdown that's clearly ahead for the Supreme [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=449.18s)]
*  Court in testing the extent of the president's Article 2 powers broadly. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=454.54s)]
*  You know, we're heading toward a big case that will be, you know, epical. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=460.7s)]
*  What's your sense as these cases move forward about where we'll end up? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=465.9s)]
*  Well, it's interesting because, David, this particular case, the one involving Los Angeles [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=470.7s)]
*  and California, the Court of Appeals last night saying this does not involve the president's [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=475.02s)]
*  constitutional authority because at the district court, when asked, the Department of Justice [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=480.21999999999997s)]
*  very clearly said, no, no, no, we're relying on this statute. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=485.54s)]
*  And they were given every opportunity by the district court, Judge Charles Breyer, to invoke [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=489.62s)]
*  a particular constitutional authority. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=494.02s)]
*  They couldn't think of one. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=496.16s)]
*  When they went to the Court of Appeals, they said, oh, now we're relying on the president's [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=497.48s)]
*  inherent Article 2 powers. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=501.02s)]
*  But the court didn't buy that and last night's decision limited him to the statute itself. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=503.78s)]
*  And so there's a lot of good news in this opinion in a way for Gavin Newsom and Rob [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=509.62s)]
*  in terms of escalating this fight, because although the court is granting Trump what [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=515.1800000000001s)]
*  he wants, they're doing so in a way that leaves a bunch of open issues, including the continued [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=520.0600000000001s)]
*  vitality of this 1827 opinion that they say they had to rely upon and granting Trump this [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=526.26s)]
*  deference. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=533.74s)]
*  But you're absolutely right. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=534.74s)]
*  There's going to be a showdown over his constitutional authority and how broad the executive powers [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=535.9s)]
*  are. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=542.5s)]
*  The unitary executive theory that has been advanced on Trump's behalf since the Bill [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=543.66s)]
*  Barr days, just trying to increasingly enlarge and large and large what belongs to the president [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=548.26s)]
*  and the president alone, that's going to be at some point at ahead at the Supreme Court. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=553.74s)]
*  And particularly if it arises in a foreign policy or a military context, there are many, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=559.78s)]
*  Joe included, I think, who would say that the Supreme Court is likely to side with Trump. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy8PC1tanHk&t=564.7s)]
