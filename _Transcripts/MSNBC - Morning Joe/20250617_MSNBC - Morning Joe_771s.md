# Trump leaves G7 early and returns to U.S. early amid Middle East conflict
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8)
*  The president, as he said today, his position has not changed. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=0.0s)]
*  What you're watching in real time is peace through strength and America first. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=4.12s)]
*  Our job is to be strong. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=8.98s)]
*  We are postured defensively in the region to be strong in pursuit of a peace deal. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=10.78s)]
*  And we certainly hope that's what happens here. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=16.98s)]
*  And America first means we're going to defend American personnel and American interests. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=19.0s)]
*  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth telling Fox News last night. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=24.98s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=28.66s)]
*  Peace through strength or strength. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=29.66s)]
*  And America first. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=32.22s)]
*  It's like a couple of bumper stickers. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=33.22s)]
*  He could have just held up bumper stickers. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=34.22s)]
*  I don't understand what that means. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=35.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=37.62s)]
*  Israel, wait, we're talking about Israel's peace through? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=38.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=42.3s)]
*  Jonathan O'meer, I'm confused. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=43.3s)]
*  What was that? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=45.26s)]
*  Is that like peace through strength? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=46.26s)]
*  He's talking about Israel? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=47.54s)]
*  Was that an Israeli? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=49.739999999999995s)]
*  Like been in the Hebrew peace through strength? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=51.42s)]
*  America first? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=54.7s)]
*  Netanyahu bombing Iran? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=55.7s)]
*  I'm deeply confused. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=58.5s)]
*  What was that? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=60.06s)]
*  Well, that was the secretary of defense. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=61.06s)]
*  What's he trying to say here? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=62.06s)]
*  Can you interpret this for me? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=63.06s)]
*  I'm a simple caveman lawyer who stays up too late watching the Red Sox pitch shut-in shut-outs [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=65.06s)]
*  and things such as this. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=71.78s)]
*  But go ahead. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=73.38s)]
*  Yeah, maybe secretary. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=74.38s)]
*  We don't know his baseball allegiance. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=75.38s)]
*  We need to figure that out. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=76.74000000000001s)]
*  That was the secretary of defense speaking a lot of platitudes without a lot of meaning [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=78.26s)]
*  behind it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=82.38000000000001s)]
*  But it was part of an effort by the White House to combat some information last night. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=83.38000000000001s)]
*  Rumors swirling as President Trump cut short his stay at the G7 in Canada, rushing back [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=88.06s)]
*  to the White House. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=93.78s)]
*  Reports out of Israel that the U.S. was actively engaging and being involved in the war, perhaps [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=95.42s)]
*  even attacking Iran. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=100.14s)]
*  The White House very quickly put out a bunch of statements saying, that's not true, that's [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=101.62s)]
*  not true. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=104.74000000000001s)]
*  So, there may be even more to this politically, for domestic politics, manga politics, more [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=106.22s)]
*  than anything else. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=121.3s)]
*  Tucker Carlson going on Steve Bannon's show yesterday and again saying that Donald Trump [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=123.3s)]
*  going along with Netanyahu could not only destroy the American empire, but also destroy [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=129.57999999999998s)]
*  his presidency. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=134.74s)]
*  We've heard other people, other Fox News commentators and others out there in the right wing, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=136.42000000000002s)]
*  MAGA sort of media sphere, talking about this civil war that's coming domestically inside, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=141.58s)]
*  saying that Donald Trump's going to destroy his presidency. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=149.78s)]
*  So is that what he's saying? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=152.26000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump supporting Israel is really America first? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=154.06s)]
*  And that's why people need to just, you know, people on MAGA base need to go along with [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=158.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's the subtext here. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=164.62s)]
*  There's been a real divide, particularly in the last couple of days, and it really exploded [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=165.70000000000002s)]
*  yesterday, as you said. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=169.10000000000002s)]
*  So almost a civil war within the MAGA movement. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=170.46s)]
*  There's the Tucker Carlson wing that is saying don't be involved in Iran. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=172.5s)]
*  You know, when Donald Trump first ran for office 10 years ago yesterday, he pledged [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=177.02s)]
*  to no more, not be involved in these forever wars, no more Middle East entanglements and [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=181.02s)]
*  the like. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=184.94s)]
*  America first, much more of an isolationist view. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=185.94s)]
*  There's the other side of this, Mark Levine, Charlie and some of the Rupert Murdoch and [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=188.61999999999998s)]
*  others members of that wing who say no, now is the time where Iran is weak, the US should [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=194.33999999999997s)]
*  be involved, if not directly, but at least support Israel's efforts. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=198.98s)]
*  And there is a schism here and President Trump well aware of this schism. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=202.7s)]
*  He in fact called Tucker Carlson kooky last night in a social media post after Carlson [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=206.38s)]
*  called him complicit in what we're seeing in Iran right now. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=210.89999999999998s)]
*  And I am told by people close to the president, he's mindful of trying to satisfy both bases. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=214.9s)]
*  And that's why we're getting a little bit of a waffling. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=220.26000000000002s)]
*  He's not quite sure how to navigate this very fast moving situation in the Middle East. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=223.46s)]
*  Well you can go back to 1979. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=229.18s)]
*  Mika, of course, something your father was greatly aware of. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=231.18s)]
*  When Ayatollah Khomeini took over Iran, you actually had the rise of a terrorist state. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=236.5s)]
*  The first Islamist state, but a terrorist state that exported terrorism across the Middle [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=243.62s)]
*  East and across the globe. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=248.70000000000002s)]
*  It's been the epicenter of terrorism since 1979. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=249.70000000000002s)]
*  There have been conservatives out there, traditional conservatives. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=252.38s)]
*  There have been people like Mark Levin who was before being a Trump conservative, a Reagan [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=255.58s)]
*  conservative and for so many conservatives, Iran has been the epicenter of terror. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=262.86s)]
*  The feeling in those quarters that we are this close to seeing Israel actually finish [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=269.94s)]
*  off this radical regime that has exported terrorism across the globe now for almost [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=278.94s)]
*  50 years. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=284.46000000000004s)]
*  They don't want to hear other people inside the MAGA base saying, ah, let Israel off the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=287.22s)]
*  hook or let Iran off the hook. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=292.06s)]
*  It is going to be a fascinating ideological battle on the MAGA right. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=295.42s)]
*  Well there's more news that happened overnight to get to. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=299.98s)]
*  Also with us this morning, New York Times opinion columnist David French. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=303.06s)]
*  And columnist and associate editor for the Washington Post, David Ignatius is with us [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=307.5s)]
*  as well. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=312.38s)]
*  I'm just curious, David French, you are also part of the expat conservative community like [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=313.38s)]
*  me. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=318.82s)]
*  I'm curious, what do you think about conservatives living in a strange land? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=320.26s)]
*  What is being called conservative now? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=325.26s)]
*  Ronald Reagan would not have recognized. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=327.26s)]
*  Hell, people 10 years ago wouldn't have recognized. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=329.78s)]
*  I'm curious, your thoughts on this civil war inside the MAGA world about the Tucker Carlson [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=333.74s)]
*  side, the isolationist side, the so-called America first side versus those who since [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=340.53999999999996s)]
*  1979 have seen Iran as the epicenter of terrorism on the globe, believing that if you can take [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=348.42s)]
*  down the Islamic State in Iran or if you can stand back and watch Israel do it, that's [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=355.02s)]
*  not a bad thing. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=365.38s)]
*  I'm curious your thoughts on that. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=366.38s)]
*  Yeah, this conflict was inevitable from the moment that Donald Trump was sworn in. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=368.1s)]
*  I mean, look, Israel was already engaged in active warfare at that time. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=372.82s)]
*  Those attacks were changing the reality on the ground, rendering Iran far more vulnerable [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=377.78s)]
*  to an attack than it's been in a long time. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=382.65999999999997s)]
*  The opportunity was there for Israel. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=385.34s)]
*  I think it was only a matter of time, no matter who won the election before Israel was going [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=388.02s)]
*  to take advantage of this opportunity to hit Iran, to hit Iran's nuclear facilities. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=392.44s)]
*  And then Donald Trump was going to have to make some choices he didn't want to make because [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=397.47999999999996s)]
*  he had convinced one set of Americans that he was going to be Israel's best ally. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=401.09999999999997s)]
*  He convinced another set of Americans that he was going to be totally turning the page [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=406.22s)]
*  on American foreign policy in a way that no other president had. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=410.42s)]
*  And these things are not reconcilable. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=414.14s)]
*  These are not reconcilable ideas. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=415.90000000000003s)]
*  And I think what he's hoping is that Israel can finish the job with Iran so that he doesn't [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=417.5s)]
*  even have to make the decision. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=423.1s)]
*  But it's very unclear whether Israel can finish the job, especially with the deeply buried [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=425.42s)]
*  nuclear sites, without American help. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=430.8s)]
*  And what happens if he leaves Israel hanging with the job almost done, not completely done [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=433.7s)]
*  militarily? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=438.78s)]
*  And so he's going to—right now, I'm sure he's hoping that Israel can resolve this for [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=440.14s)]
*  him. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=446.26s)]
*  But it looks like he's going to have some tough choices to make, and one part of his [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=447.26s)]
*  coalition is just not going to like the outcome. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=450.53999999999996s)]
*  Well, and I would say David Ignatius will confirm this, I'm sure. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=453.06s)]
*  You're not going to get rid of the nuclear program. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=458.3s)]
*  You're not going to get rid of the nuclear site without American weapons, with American [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=460.78s)]
*  bunker-busting bombs. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=464.5s)]
*  As they say, David, I won't get you in the middle of this maga civil war. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=466.85999999999996s)]
*  I will ask you a question that a lot of people have to be thinking, because we—you and [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=470.14s)]
*  I remember November of 1979. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=474.65999999999997s)]
*  Remember the Iranian hostage crisis. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=478.44s)]
*  Remember Ayatollah Khomeini coming to power and suddenly creating all of these—are supporting [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=480.53999999999996s)]
*  Hamas, Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad, being this perceived power, massive power in the Middle [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=487.5s)]
*  East that the Saudis and all of our Sunni Arab allies feared. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=496.62s)]
*  I'm curious, was the foreign policy community surprised at just how weak Iran ended up being [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=502.22s)]
*  when we got the news months ago that their air defenses were completely stripped, that [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=516.4599999999999s)]
*  Israel could attack at will? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=521.2199999999999s)]
*  Because I would guess most Americans, after hearing about this frightful Iranian regime, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=523.42s)]
*  revolutionary regime, would never have seen this coming, where Iran right now is basically [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=529.78s)]
*  at the will of what Israel decides it's going to do, strike after strike after strike. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=538.3s)]
*  So we get to this moment where Israel has what seems unchallenged dominance over Iran's [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=545.14s)]
*  skies, the ability to bomb almost any target in Iran that it wants, through this enormously [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=552.4599999999999s)]
*  difficult period since October 7, 2023, in which Israel initially was just battered and [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=560.62s)]
*  traumatized and then began rolling back the Iranian-backed proxies in Lebanon, in Gaza, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=568.5s)]
*  in Syria was another process, but the same thing happened, and then beginning to really [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=577.54s)]
*  move in on Iran in October, took out Iranian air defenses around Tehran to a large extent. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=581.9s)]
*  And at the time, Israel— [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=588.78s)]
*  David, are you surprised by how easy that was? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=589.78s)]
*  Are you surprised that this supposed superpower in the Middle East, that for good reasons [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=591.5799999999999s)]
*  had been feared for decades, had its air defenses so easily wiped out, that Hamas leaders were [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=599.06s)]
*  so easily targeted in Iran while visiting Iran and assassinated, that their proxies [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=609.0999999999999s)]
*  were wiped out as easily as they were wiped out? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=618.98s)]
*  I mean, Israel, from a distance, has made this look rather easy. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=622.4200000000001s)]
*  Joe, it's been tactically brilliant. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=629.22s)]
*  I keep being astonished by each stage of this. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=632.62s)]
*  I think a lot of it is the quality of Israeli intelligence. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=637.62s)]
*  They seem to know just where people are going to be in Tehran. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=641.14s)]
*  When they struck early Friday, in the beginning of this latest round, they knew the locations [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=645.22s)]
*  of every senior commander and went in with munitions. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=651.38s)]
*  In most cases, it seems to have been drones that Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=656.02s)]
*  had smuggled into Iran and took those people out in their apartments, in their homes, bing, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=660.62s)]
*  bing, one after another. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=666.66s)]
*  The same kind of precision intelligence has been seen in other parts of the campaign, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=669.3000000000001s)]
*  leading up to where we are now. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=674.18s)]
*  I think that the dilemma that Israel has and the United States, as its friend and ally [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=676.18s)]
*  has, is for all of Israel's tactical brilliance, the strategic side, how does this end up? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=682.1s)]
*  What's the end state of this conflict? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=688.22s)]
*  It has always been a weaker part of their operations. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=690.26s)]
*  That's what we're asking now as we look at Iran. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=695.42s)]
*  How does this end? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=698.3s)]
*  Does this end with an Israeli attack with U.S. munitions on the last major facility [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=699.4599999999999s)]
*  in their nuclear complex, Fordow? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=705.6999999999999s)]
*  Three others have already been hit decisively, but this last one is remaining and is crucial. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=708.38s)]
*  Do we end with an attempt to topple the regime of the Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, and have [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=714.18s)]
*  regime change in Iran with all the uncertainty that that portends? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=719.78s)]
*  Those are questions that are possible because of Israel's overwhelming military dominance [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=725.98s)]
*  in the air right now. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=730.3s)]
*  I think that's part of the dilemma for the administration. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=732.42s)]
*  Do they want to stop that process before it culminates? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=736.18s)]
*  Do they think that making an 11th hour deal with Iran really is in the United States' [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=739.6999999999999s)]
*  long-term interests? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=744.18s)]
*  There's a lot of American blood on Iranian hands, as well as Israeli. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgSifq8NGR8&t=745.18s)]
