# 'Democrats need to get on board': Top Dem on why Mamdani is 'the future'
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw)
*  in Washington, and that is where Congressman Robert Garcia of California has been elected [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=0.0s)]
*  as the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee. Serving in just his second term [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=5.76s)]
*  in Congress, Garcia has quickly risen through the ranks and has emerged as a young leader [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=11.28s)]
*  for Democrats, as per our previous conversation, as they weigh what's next for their party. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=16.0s)]
*  And Congressman Robert Garcia of California joins us now. As noted, he's now the ranking member of [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  the powerful House Oversight Committee. Congressman, congratulations on your election. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=28.72s)]
*  Let's start just right there. What are your goals for that role? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=33.28s)]
*  Well, good morning. Well, first, obviously, very grateful to the Democratic caucus for [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=38.96s)]
*  entrusting me with this not just important responsibility, but the work ahead of us to [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=42.56s)]
*  hold Donald Trump, his corruption accountable, to hold corporate power and those that are trying [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=47.68s)]
*  to harm the American public accountable, and to look at reforming our government to make it more [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=52.96s)]
*  efficient and effective for the American public. We have a huge agenda in front of us, and that's [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=57.6s)]
*  ensuring that we are doing everything that we can to protect the American people. We see what's [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=62.88s)]
*  happening around the country. We're seeing what ICE and Homeland Security are doing to terrorize [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=68.0s)]
*  people across this country. We see how billionaires are trying to rip off the American people and the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=72.56s)]
*  middle class every single day. And oversight in our committee is at the heart of what Congress is [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=77.52000000000001s)]
*  about. Transparency, oversight, and good government, and we're excited to get to work. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=83.12s)]
*  So, Congressman, let's get your reaction to the breaking news. A few moments ago, the Senate [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  parliamentarian casting out much of the health provisions and some of the Medicaid cuts in the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=92.16000000000001s)]
*  so-called big, beautiful bill there in the Senate. Obviously, it's going to have to get reworked. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=99.76s)]
*  It's going to eventually find its way back to the House. Talk to us about the conversations you and [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=103.2s)]
*  your Democratic colleagues are having about this development. Well, I think the Senate's finding [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  out we in the House, Democrats, already know this is a horrific bill. Much of it unconstitutional. A [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=112.32s)]
*  lot of it will not pass for the parliamentarian, and the Senate now is struggling with this idea [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=119.27999999999999s)]
*  that what this actual bill is trying to do is to rip away health care for 16 million Americans. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=124.0s)]
*  It's trying to take away food assistance for low-income families across the country, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=130.95999999999998s)]
*  and the parliamentarian is right to strip out these provisions. And we're going to see what [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=135.68s)]
*  the Senate's going to try to do, but at the end of the day, every American should know that this [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=139.44s)]
*  bill is all about taking away health care and then giving away a huge wealth transfer to the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=144.32s)]
*  richest people in this country. The only folks who are going to benefit from this plan is billionaires [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=151.12s)]
*  and large corporations with the massive tax breaks that are going to be in place. And so the Senate's [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=157.36s)]
*  going to have a hard time trying to defend and support a bill that is taking away health care, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=161.92s)]
*  and the parliamentarian is absolutely correct. Congressman, can you talk to us a little bit about [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=167.6s)]
*  your plan to exercise oversight and some transparency into the operations of ICE? Americans [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=172.16s)]
*  across the country are disturbed by seeing some of their longtime neighbors swept up by masked [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=179.84s)]
*  police force essentially on the streets, violations of people's constitutional rights. What kind of [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=186.48s)]
*  oversight can you provide? What is the plan to do that? And especially just being in the minority, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=192.96s)]
*  can you talk about what you're able to do? Look, let me just start by saying that I'm an immigrant [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=197.6s)]
*  myself and I came to this country with family and we are grateful to this country. We love this [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=202.8s)]
*  country. What's happening right now is not the America that we know and that we've all worked [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=208.24s)]
*  hard to build. 70 percent of people that are right now being arrested and taken by ICE have zero [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=213.52s)]
*  criminal record. 70 percent. It is outrageous and shameful what is happening. We're seeing this [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=220.8s)]
*  father of three military marines being arrested, being harassed on the street. We're seeing U.S. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=227.52s)]
*  citizens being taken by ICE for no reason. We're seeing people that are essentially being scooped [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=234.8s)]
*  up who've done nothing wrong in this community that are showing up to their immigration appointments, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=239.84s)]
*  appointments given to them by us, the U.S. government, and then being arrested for absolutely [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=244.72000000000003s)]
*  no reason and given no due process. Due process is a right in this country given to all citizens [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=250.24s)]
*  and non-citizens alike in our constitution. So you can rest assured that what Homeland Security [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=258.40000000000003s)]
*  is doing, what ICE is doing, will be at the top of our agenda in the Oversight Committee. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=264.96000000000004s)]
*  Congressman, we just had an enormous political upset here in New York City in which a [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=270.48s)]
*  assemblyman, Zoran Mumdani, just won the Democratic primary for mayor. And I wonder, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=275.52s)]
*  though New York City is certainly not entirely analogous to the rest of the country, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=282.64s)]
*  his win was very compelling in all kinds of parts of the city across many backgrounds. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=287.68s)]
*  So I wonder, what lessons do you think the national Democrats can draw from this? I just [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=293.36s)]
*  specifically want to ask you about the kind of excitement that Mr. Mumdani has inspired. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=298.96s)]
*  We're seeing Democrats from, again, all different political persuasions come together to support [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=305.84s)]
*  this candidate. Has the National Party been focused too much on simply fighting Donald Trump [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=311.35999999999996s)]
*  rhetorically? Is there a positive message that Democrats should embrace? Why aren't they able [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=318.64s)]
*  to excite the base the way Mr. Mumdani has? First, I mean, I just, this was a huge win. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=323.68s)]
*  Congratulations to him. And I think as a former mayor, I looked at this race and this campaign, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=329.52s)]
*  what he was able to do was to capture the energy of the people on the ground that right now are [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=335.6s)]
*  struggling and they want their costs lower. Democrats should take lessons from his win. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=340.48s)]
*  He ran an excellent campaign. He reached out to voters on digital platforms. And I think, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=345.6s)]
*  I've been hearing a lot of folks talk about why he won or why he had support. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=350.88s)]
*  To me, it's crystal clear. He had good ideas and he took those ideas and campaigned across New York [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=354.64s)]
*  City and to implement those. So I think this is a moment for Democrats to absolutely learn [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=361.2s)]
*  good lessons from that campaign. I congratulate them. I think his campaign is exciting. And let's [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=366.0s)]
*  be really clear. He is the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City. Democrats need to get on [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=370.96s)]
*  board. This is the future and we have a lot of lessons, I think, positive to learn. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=377.2s)]
*  So on that note, one thing that cannot escape attention is that he is just 33 years old. Your [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=381.03999999999996s)]
*  party, of course, has been gripped in internal debate for that part of a year now about the age [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=386.24s)]
*  of its leadership. That included President Biden, but certainly not limited to him. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=392.64s)]
*  Do you think that this victory is voters telling your party it is time to turn the page? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=398.0s)]
*  Yes. And I think it's important to note that the Democratic Party has struggled. We know this [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=404.08s)]
*  already. But it is also now expanding the tent. It is looking at new leaders. We should always [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=411.68s)]
*  be looking at the next generation of folks to bring to the table. There is an energy out there. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=416.72s)]
*  People are fired up. I am grateful to have been elected by my colleagues to this role. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=422.24s)]
*  I get the difference and for some folks, the change that that also represents here in Congress. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=426.72s)]
*  What Zoran is doing in New York City is something that is reaching not just voters there, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=433.68s)]
*  but across the country. Democrats need to embrace the young people in our party that are demanding [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=438.64s)]
*  change, that are out there and actually promoting good ideas that appeal to the American public. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=444.71999999999997s)]
*  I think it's an exciting moment for the party. Congressman, lastly, before we let you go, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=449.68s)]
*  revisiting our top story, of course, the military strikes in Iran a few days ago. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=454.08s)]
*  You sit on the Homeland Security Committee. Do you have concerns about potential retaliation [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=458.88000000000005s)]
*  from Iran? They have blustered Tehran heads about having sleeper cells that they could activate [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=465.28000000000003s)]
*  throughout the West, including here in the U.S. What sort of alert are you on? What should Americans [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=470.48s)]
*  be considering? First, I also saw this horrific press conference. I think that our posture right [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=475.52000000000004s)]
*  now should not be attacking the press, not giving us information and certainly downplaying [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=482.32s)]
*  the seriousness of what the moment is in. I think that we should all be very concerned [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=488.48s)]
*  about what just happened. We had essentially a strike in Iran with no consultation. We are, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=492.64s)]
*  to this day, those of us in Congress have received no classified information or briefing about what [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=498.15999999999997s)]
*  happened. Zero. We had actually briefing that was canceled by the White House administration. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=504.24s)]
*  The American public should know that Congress is in the dark. There is only one person who knows [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=509.12s)]
*  what's happening right now, and it's Donald Trump. And that should concern every single American. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=513.76s)]
*  And in addition to that, we have no idea how successful this actual strike was. These reports [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=518.08s)]
*  that are coming out right now are incredibly concerning, but we actually may have, in fact, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=524.8s)]
*  have done the opposite. Iran may now be empowered to actually speed up development of a nuclear [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=529.52s)]
*  weapon, which we know is not acceptable in the region. So it is very concerning. And we have [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=535.6s)]
*  no information right now to what's going on, and we are demanding answers. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=540.48s)]
*  This what's happening right now should not be happening in the United States [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=545.76s)]
*  and is not making us safer. And those postponed congressional briefings will start later today, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=549.0400000000001s)]
*  Senate side first over the House tomorrow. Covering a lot of ground with us this morning, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=553.9200000000001s)]
*  ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, Democratic Congressman Robert Garcia of California. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=558.72s)]
*  Congressman, thank you. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDrbP7r6Bw&t=563.44s)]
