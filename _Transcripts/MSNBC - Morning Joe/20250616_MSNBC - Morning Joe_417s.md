# E Jean Carroll explains why 'Not My Type' was a 'top-secret job'
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8)
*  President Donald Trump has failed to persuade a federal appeals court to reconsider the $5 million verdict won by E. Jean Carroll [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=0.0s)]
*  after a jury found Trump liable for sexually abusing the former magazine columnist back in the 1990s [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=8.0s)]
*  and then defaming her after she went public with her allegations. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=15.0s)]
*  In an 8-2 vote, the second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan on Friday left intact [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=18.0s)]
*  its December 30th decision by a three-judge panel that upheld the jury award. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=24.0s)]
*  Carroll accused Trump of attacking her around 1996 in a Bergdorf Goodman department store dressing room here in Manhattan [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=29.0s)]
*  and defaming her then in October 22 on a Truth Social post by denying her claim as a hoax. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=37.0s)]
*  In his denial, Trump said the former El Comunist was, quote, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=43.0s)]
*  not my type and that she made up the rape claim to promote her memoir. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=48.0s)]
*  Jurers decided in May of 2023 that Trump had sexually assaulted Carroll and defamed her by lying. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=53.0s)]
*  They did not find that Trump raped Carroll as she had claimed. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=60.0s)]
*  A spokesperson for Trump's lawyers said in a statement that Americans, quote, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=63.0s)]
*  demand an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system and a swift dismissal of all of the witch hunts, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=68.0s)]
*  including the Democrat-funded Carroll hoax, which will continue to be appealed. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=75.0s)]
*  And E. Jean Carroll joins us now. Her new book with the title Not My Type, One Woman Versus a President, goes on sale tomorrow. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=81.0s)]
*  Thank you for being here. And it is normal for a highly anticipated book to receive plenty of advance notice with lots of anticipation and hype. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=91.0s)]
*  This was announced just two days ago and now coming out tomorrow. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=102.0s)]
*  Talk to us about the secrecy around this book. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=106.0s)]
*  Well, the behind the scenes goings on at those two trials were so funny and so hilarious, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=109.0s)]
*  I had found myself in the middle of a high comedy surrounded by characters that not even John Gresham could have created. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=121.0s)]
*  It was just too juicy. We did not want the White House to hear about it. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=132.0s)]
*  And so they, the people at St. Mark's locked, locked copies of this book in their offices. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=138.0s)]
*  I didn't have a copy of the book until two days ago. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=146.0s)]
*  So first time I ever laid hands. It was a top secret job. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=151.0s)]
*  I think we got away with it. And the only thing that's beating us now is Molly's book is now on the bestseller list. Congratulations, Molly. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=155.0s)]
*  I mean, really, bestseller, New York Times bestseller. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=164.0s)]
*  Congrats to Molly, of course. And we certainly would anticipate yours to do well also. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=169.0s)]
*  So talk to us about, I mean, a legal proceeding involving someone who was and now is again the president of the United States. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=174.0s)]
*  I think what strikes many is a serious matter. But you just said that it was you found things about it that were very funny. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=181.0s)]
*  Give us a taste as to what you mean. What are some of the moments captured in this book? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=186.0s)]
*  The characters alone. We have Judge Kaplan, a steel rod of a man, looks like God on the Sistine Chapel ceiling. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=190.0s)]
*  Right. Conservative, no nonsense. And yet gets off one liners like Stephen Colbert. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=202.0s)]
*  We have Joe Takapina belt like Popeye got a voice like a shotgun in a gravel pit, you know, just dresses in six thousand dollar suits. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=209.0s)]
*  We have Alina Haba Esquire, Trump's most beautiful attorney. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=219.0s)]
*  Cheap bones like tulip bulbs. Right. Eyes like a baby seal. Gorgeous. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=224.0s)]
*  Smart, deliciously arrogant and yet didn't know diddly squad about the law. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=230.0s)]
*  And then we have my attorney, Robby Kaplan, who was born with a lust for battle. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=238.0s)]
*  You put all these characters together. You have high jinx. You have humor. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=246.0s)]
*  You have dead serious, dead serious days we saw in that courtroom where, by the way, Trump was found liable for sexual abuse in the first trial. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=252.0s)]
*  So dead serious. But on the whole, uplifting because we can see what really goes on in a courtroom. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=267.0s)]
*  So, as you know, you're not a popular person in Trump's circles in the White House and his campaign have attacked you throughout a moment of pride, including the idea that you're simply trying to make money. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=275.0s)]
*  Well, and there's been some speculation over the weekend from them that that's the same deal with this book. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=287.0s)]
*  This is another attempt at a cash grab. I'm trying. I'm an old journalist. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=293.0s)]
*  There was no way, no way I could help myself but to take note of what actually was going on. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=298.0s)]
*  Would you like to hear what it's like sitting right in front of Donald Trump? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=306.0s)]
*  We were so close in the courtroom. If I leaned back and reached my hand, I could have grabbed him by the hair so I could hear everything he was saying. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=311.0s)]
*  I could hear the snorts and the whines and the bitching and the bowling and the spitting and the hishing and his arms going like this on the desk. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=321.0s)]
*  And I always I thought to myself, oh, my God, what if the jury is hearing this? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=332.0s)]
*  And I turned and looked at the jury and they're like petrified with delight. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=336.0s)]
*  I mean, so what? I'm not going to write about that. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=341.0s)]
*  So the title of this book is not my type. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=345.0s)]
*  And that is a phrase that we have heard a lot from men when confronted with something. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=348.0s)]
*  I want you to talk about what that phrase means and the sort of innate misogyny in it. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=355.0s)]
*  Well, nobody can measure up to that. That's a terrible, that's a terrible bar for what we have to meet every individual man's in the population. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=362.0s)]
*  We have to reach his bar of being his type. It's absurd. It's ridiculous. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=374.0s)]
*  It's horrible. And women should pay no attention to it. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=379.0s)]
*  The new book, Not My Type, One Woman vs. the President, written in secrecy, goes on sale tomorrow. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=384.0s)]
*  People want to read it. Author, E. Jean Carroll. Thank you so much for being with us this morning. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=391.0s)]
*  I love being here. I love seeing my friend, Molly. We all do. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=394.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGsCvxyT7n8&t=404.0s)]
