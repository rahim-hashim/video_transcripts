# Republicans 'complicit' in Trump's corruption: Senator slams party over crypto dinner
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI)
*  As we tease before the break, President Trump held a private dinner last night for more than 200 investors [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=0.0s)]
*  Who bought into his meme coin the event was held at his golf club in Northern, Virginia [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=6.68s)]
*  NBC News has learned that the guests paid between [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=12.36s)]
*  55,000 and [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=16.04s)]
*  37.7 million dollars for the Trump coin [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=18.36s)]
*  Making the average cost of a seat at the dinner over one million dollars [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=21.84s)]
*  While the website for the contest says the president was appearing as a guest and not soliciting any funds for it [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=26.88s)]
*  Another site says that 80% of the Trump coin project is owned by two companies affiliated or in business with [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=33.839999999999996s)]
*  President Trump on top of that the identities of most of the attendees are largely private [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=41.92s)]
*  But the majority of the 220 guests are likely foreign investors [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  Based on independent research and blockchain analysis [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=54.0s)]
*  All of this is raising ethics concerns about buying access to the president and him using the dinner to personally enrich himself [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=57.68s)]
*  That's why there were dozens of protesters outside of Trump's golf club in Sterling, Virginia as guests were arriving last night [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=64.92s)]
*  The White House yesterday, of course dismissed any conflicts of interest, but several Democratic senators saw major issues [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=72.96s)]
*  On the president's dinner tonight [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=80.55999999999999s)]
*  Will the White House commit to making a list of the attendees public so people can see who's paying for that kind of access to the president? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=83.19999999999999s)]
*  Well, as you know, Gareth this question has been raised with the president. I have also addressed the dinner tonight. The president is [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=90.24s)]
*  Attending it in his personal time. It is not a White House dinner [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=97.56s)]
*  It's not taking place here at the White House [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=100.63999999999999s)]
*  But certainly I can raise that question and try to get you an answer for it [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=102.56s)]
*  You mentioned this is not a White House dinner, but the president is always the president and the Trump family is making money off of this [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=106.12s)]
*  So can you just explain how is this not the president using the office to enrich himself? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=112.08s)]
*  All of the president's assets are in a blind trust which is managed by his children [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=116.4s)]
*  and I would argue [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=120.67999999999999s)]
*  one of the many reasons that the American people [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=122.16s)]
*  Re-elected this president back to this office is because he was a very successful businessman before giving it up to publicly serve our country [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=125.0s)]
*  Just because the corruption is playing out in public where everybody can see it doesn't mean that it isn't [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=133.0s)]
*  rampant rapacious corruption [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=138.72s)]
*  And what is happening tonight? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  this [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=144.51999999999998s)]
*  private secret dinner in which individuals who have put money in Donald Trump's pocket get access to him is [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=145.83999999999997s)]
*  Maybe the most corrupt of all the corruption [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump is using the presidency [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=158.64s)]
*  of the United States to make himself richer [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=161.92s)]
*  Through crypto and he's doing it right out there in plain sight [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=166.32s)]
*  President Trump is saying open your wallet hand me your money and we'll consider the request that you have [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=170.64s)]
*  This story is about Donald Trump, but it's also about Republicans [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=178.48s)]
*  It's about Republicans having no backbone or spine [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=182.0s)]
*  It's about Republicans [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=185.76s)]
*  Complicit in Donald Trump's corruption [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=188.56s)]
*  Peter baker the concerns over the trump hotel in the first term seem almost quaint [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=193.6s)]
*  with where we are now just a couple days after the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  Brujaha over the qatari jet now we have this and and that your package laid out so well [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=202.48s)]
*  the concerns about president trump and his family enriching themselves [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=208.64s)]
*  Because with this meme coin, I mean you've covered the white house for a long time [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=213.68s)]
*  I mean i'm almost speechless at this. Could you imagine if barack obama or joe biden did anything like it? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=219.68s)]
*  No, we couldn't they could they never did anything like this. This is just [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=226.88s)]
*  It's not the first presidential family that kind of profited off the white house [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=231.2s)]
*  You can certainly find other examples of that in history [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=234.32s)]
*  But the scale of this the scope of this is so far beyond anything history has ever seen [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=236.56s)]
*  Uh, it's not just even this cryptocurrency thing, although hundreds of millions of dollars have gone to the president's family and businesses [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=241.36s)]
*  Uh in fees because of this coin, which is basically just remind reminder [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=247.84s)]
*  It's an there's nothing to it. There's a coin is it's uh, it's a it's a it's not a value of anything. It's not even a [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=252.16s)]
*  Uh a stock it's not even a share of a company that's producing something. It's just simply there for people to buy [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=258.72s)]
*  Uh because they want to curry favor with the president and they can do it anonymously [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=265.76s)]
*  They can do it secretly by the way foreign entities can do that [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=270.32s)]
*  We also saw as as he went around the middle east last week the president his family was out there [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=274.4s)]
*  You know sealing deals making deals. They have been uh building projects that obviously had [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=279.92s)]
*  Interests from people who would like to curry favor with the president of the united states [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=285.84s)]
*  Melania trump made 28 million dollars from this amazon, you know [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=291.28s)]
*  Uh [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=296.96s)]
*  Film is you know, whatever we want to call basically an extended advertisement for her [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=298.56s)]
*  Uh that they have made her executive producer and she's going to be uh profiting from I mean the the endless numbers of ways that this family [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=302.47999999999996s)]
*  Is making money put even hunter biden as much as the republic has complained about him trading on his father's name [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=310.88s)]
*  It makes him look like a piker by comparison [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=316.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, simply not comparable matt lewis [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=319.67999999999995s)]
*  I mean we saw lamar odum was the nba star apparently who also was there last night. Um, you know [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=322.0s)]
*  Why why do republicans? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=328.8s)]
*  not [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=331.12s)]
*  care [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=332.16s)]
*  Because whatever donald trump wants to do donald trump does and they saw whether it's the access hollywood video [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=334.88s)]
*  Or the indictments that this guy is magic and he always ends up landing on his feet [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=341.36s)]
*  And their base loves him. So they're afraid of him. So [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=347.92s)]
*  Some of them may care a little bit but not enough to do anything about it [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=351.52s)]
*  But look the the implications here are serious, right? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=355.28s)]
*  Democracy isn't dying. It's being rug pulled. That's basically what the message here is and uh, you know [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=358.47999999999996s)]
*  It's hard to look at what happened last night [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=365.2s)]
*  And not see it anything other than bribery dressed up as a fancy cocktail hour. I mean, it's so [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=367.91999999999996s)]
*  Obvious it would be transparent if we knew who was there, but it's transparently it is obviously bribery [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=375.20000000000005s)]
*  And you know as peter was saying, uh, we've seen something like this before not to this extent certainly [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=382.08000000000004s)]
*  But i'm old enough to remember bill clinton [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=387.44s)]
*  And you know allegations of bringing out [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=390.16s)]
*  The lincoln bedroom and chinese donors and scandals real scandals that I think actually damaged bill clinton [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=392.96000000000004s)]
*  Uh acute the accumulation of these scandals certainly [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=401.28000000000003s)]
*  and uh, I wonder why that's not happening now and [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=404.88000000000005s)]
*  I don't want to blame the victims here, but I don't think democrats have a new gingrich or a rush limbaugh [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=408.96000000000004s)]
*  And if they did, you know, we see those democrats standing up there condemning this [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=414.56s)]
*  I don't think it's landing yet. Uh, and so, you know, yes republicans ought to be standing up and holding their president [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=419.52000000000004s)]
*  Their standard bearer accountable [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=427.35999999999996s)]
*  I don't think the democrats yet have the jews to take what is just transparently [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=429.76s)]
*  Bribery and make it matter to the american people [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=435.41999999999996s)]
*  Well, we'll hear from one of those democrats senator amy clobetor a little later this morning. We'll certainly revisit this topic with her author [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=439.12s)]
*  You [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx9TGGGp0oI&t=456.96s)]
