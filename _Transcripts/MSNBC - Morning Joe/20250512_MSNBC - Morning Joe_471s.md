# Gen Z men are more likely to attend religious services than millennials, study finds
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg)
*  And a new study showing members of Gen Z are becoming more religious than millennials. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=0.0s)]
*  And the shift is being driven by young men. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=6.24s)]
*  According to data from Pew Research, in recent decades, each successive generation identified [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=8.72s)]
*  less with Christianity until Gen Z. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  Some have speculated that young people may be seeking community after years of isolation [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=18.96s)]
*  brought on by the pandemic and social media. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=24.36s)]
*  This is now National Correspondent for the New York Times, Ruth Graham. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=27.56s)]
*  She covers religion, faith, and values. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=30.479999999999997s)]
*  Ruth, thank you so much for being with us. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=32.68s)]
*  This is a remarkable study because it seems to me every time we say goodbye to a pope, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=34.72s)]
*  I remember this being said, Pope John Paul II, Pope Benedict, Pope Francis. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=41.32s)]
*  You have heard about emptying pews across the West, but that's not the case here in [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=46.7s)]
*  the United States. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=52.92s)]
*  Doesn't seem to be the case in France and even, you know, Great Britain. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  When I go to beautiful churches in Great Britain, they've in the past served more as museum [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=58.08s)]
*  pieces, as active places of worship, but even church attendance up a good bit in Great Britain. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=63.800000000000004s)]
*  What's driving this? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=72.12s)]
*  That's right. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=74.12s)]
*  I mean, when this first started to kind of emerge in surveys, it shocked experts because [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=75.12s)]
*  it sort of upended everything that people thought they knew about American religion, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  which is, you know, this very steady decline over time, young people less and less religious [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=83.72s)]
*  than every preceding generation, and specifically, you know, women being really consistently [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=88.96s)]
*  more religious than men, you know, around the world in every religion. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=95.34s)]
*  So to see young men driving this is really, really surprising. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=100.8s)]
*  And there's a lot going on. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=106.16s)]
*  I mean, here in the U.S., religion is sort of coded, especially Christianity, is coded [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=107.16s)]
*  more conservative. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=113.32000000000001s)]
*  We know that young men are more conservative than young women by a larger than usual gap. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  And so, yeah, a lot of different factors going into this. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=121.64s)]
*  But it's a really, really fascinating, you know, kind of scrambles a lot of the trends [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=124.36s)]
*  that we thought we understood. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=128.64s)]
*  Well, and the young men portion of it so fascinating. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=130.32s)]
*  They're, of course, young men. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=133.44s)]
*  People like Scott Galloway have been talking about this for quite some time. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=135.84s)]
*  You look at the numbers, young men are falling behind in every way. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=139.24s)]
*  They're falling behind, whether it's educational status or social status, all of these other [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=141.96s)]
*  things. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  And they've become far more isolated from young men in my generation. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=149.64000000000001s)]
*  And so do you think that's that's also a big driver for them to go to seek community [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=154.24s)]
*  and in a church that also they will seize being less judgmental of them than the society [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=161.0s)]
*  at large? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=167.36s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=168.36s)]
*  I mean, we hear a lot about the loneliness epidemic. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=170.04000000000002s)]
*  And as you said, men and young men and young women are on really different trajectories [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  just in terms of educational attainment, even income. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=176.8s)]
*  You know, in some cities, you know, women now earn more than men. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=180.4s)]
*  Young women earn more than young men. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=184.18s)]
*  And even kind of how they talk about their desires for family life. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  Young men expressing more desire to have children, which, again, also, I think is really surprising [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=190.76000000000002s)]
*  to a lot of us older people. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=195.16000000000003s)]
*  And, you know, yes, like when we think about loneliness, church is a place to find that. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=198.36s)]
*  So, you know, I've talked to church leaders and also young men themselves who say, you [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=203.84s)]
*  know, this is a place where, you know, my identity as a man is is affirmed. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=208.88s)]
*  I feel good about myself. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=213.36s)]
*  I'm making friendships. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=215.12s)]
*  I'm getting leadership with older guys who I respect. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=216.6s)]
*  And so, you know, there I talked to a pastor last year who said young men are seeking clarity. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=221.08s)]
*  They're seeking leadership. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=227.32s)]
*  They're seeking community. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=228.56s)]
*  And church for a lot of people is a place to find that. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=230.28s)]
*  So, Ruth, talk to us about maybe some of the political implications. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=232.79999999999998s)]
*  Obviously, there are, you know, lots of reasons why young people might be going to church [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=235.79999999999998s)]
*  and lots of you just outlined some good reasons. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=240.88s)]
*  But talk to us about the impact that that is having perhaps in where some of these young [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=243.82s)]
*  people, particularly young men, might be leading politically. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=248.88s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, obviously, they're drawn to a variety of churches. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=251.6s)]
*  But there is a strong movement in the evangelical church right now to encourage pastors to speak [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=257.84s)]
*  more forthrightly about politics. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=262.84s)]
*  And that is overwhelmingly a conservative phenomenon. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=265.15999999999997s)]
*  So you see someone like Charlie Kirk telling pastors, you know, step up, stand up, get [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=269.03999999999996s)]
*  more involved politically. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=274.47999999999996s)]
*  That's having a big impact on churches across the country. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=276.2s)]
*  Those churches are growing and they're really growing among young men specifically. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=279.59999999999997s)]
*  So definitely a big sort of culture shift happening. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=286.59999999999997s)]
*  And as you're seeing young men kind of drawn into these more conservative spaces, that [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=289.79999999999995s)]
*  also is connected with with, you know, voting and political political landscape as well, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=294.15999999999997s)]
*  for sure. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=299.56s)]
*  You know, Ruth, and again, this is just my view. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=300.56s)]
*  I don't know if you've seen this yourself. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=303.08s)]
*  So this is not a leading question. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=305.52s)]
*  Just my experience, though, growing up in the Baptist Church, going to conservative [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=308.79999999999995s)]
*  evangelical churches or that even if, let's say, 80 percent of the people in these churches [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=314.28000000000003s)]
*  vote Republican consistently. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=321.16s)]
*  What I always found was when we were sitting around, whether it was in Bible study or sitting [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=323.92s)]
*  around in Sunday school before going to church, you would always have some people come in [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=329.92s)]
*  with pretty crazy conspiracy theories. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=335.24s)]
*  I read this or I did that. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=337.76s)]
*  And it always had a moderating impact where these other conservative Christians around [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=340.64s)]
*  the circle would be like, I don't think that's it. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=345.71999999999997s)]
*  They would talk to it. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=349.24s)]
*  And again, it seems to me there's nothing more dangerous than isolation for a lot of [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=350.24s)]
*  young men and young women. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=357.2s)]
*  But but talk about how even in conservative churches, getting together in groups, not [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=360.15999999999997s)]
*  being isolated in your room or in your basement actually could have a moderating impact personally [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=366.76s)]
*  and politically. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=374.0s)]
*  I'm not saying they're going to vote for AOC. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=375.0s)]
*  I'm just saying they'll be less likely to fall victim to right wing conspiracy theories. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=377.84000000000003s)]
*  Oh, it's absolutely right. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=384.0s)]
*  I mean, we know that churches are politically segregated, racially segregated to a certain [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=386.2s)]
*  degree, although a lot of evangelical churches are more multiracial than people might expect. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=392.08s)]
*  But church is a place to come and encounter people who are different than you in some [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=397.68s)]
*  ways, bounce ideas off them. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=403.08s)]
*  Again, a lot of intergenerational conversation and as you said, a moderating effect. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=405.36s)]
*  So I think that's that's absolutely true for many, many people. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=410.92s)]
*  It's a place to sort of be in conversation with people who are a little bit different, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=415.92s)]
*  maybe a little bit older and wiser than you. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=420.88s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=423.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=424.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=425.28s)]
*  And by the way, some people in some of those churches could vote for AOC. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=426.28s)]
*  I've always found much like politicians always tried to simplify the political views of Hispanics. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=428.32s)]
*  I've gone to some very conservative, theologically conservative churches with quite a few Democrats [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=437.2s)]
*  in there as well. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=442.76s)]
*  New York Times national correspondent Ruth Graham. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=443.76s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=446.71999999999997s)]
*  I greatly appreciate you being here. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=447.71999999999997s)]
*  We can talk about this some more. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNkaqbNcFyg&t=449.64s)]
