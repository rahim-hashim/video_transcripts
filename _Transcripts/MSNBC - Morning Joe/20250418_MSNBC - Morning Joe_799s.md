# 'Wrong on the law, wrong on the facts': Joe slams Trump WH on Abrego Garcia
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [April 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g)
*  Yeah, and this ruling that El Salvador was the one place he couldn't be sent back to, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=0.0s)]
*  and then of course that is the place he is sent back to, really undermines the question [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=4.0s)]
*  of due process in this case. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=8.4s)]
*  And that's why you have even conservatives on the legal side saying this case needs to [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=9.84s)]
*  be watched very carefully to see how the administration deals with it. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=14.64s)]
*  From the Democratic side, though, what we had yesterday was Senator Chris Van Hollen [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=18.22s)]
*  of Maryland. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=21.56s)]
*  He met with Kilmar Brego Garcia in a hotel in El Salvador that comes after the senator [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=22.8s)]
*  was denied initially access to the prison where the Maryland man is being held. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=28.56s)]
*  Images of the meeting were first posted online by El Salvador's president, who has rejected [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=33.6s)]
*  calls to return Abrego Garcia to the United States. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=39.08s)]
*  Right now it's not clear how the senator managed to get the meeting last night. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=43.36s)]
*  Van Hollen posted on social media that he had spoken to Abrego Garcia's wife and that [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=48.0s)]
*  he would provide more details when he returned back to the U.S. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  The White House then in turn responded to that post, calling the meeting truly disgusting [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=57.04s)]
*  and continued to characterize Abrego Garcia as a gang member. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=62.24s)]
*  Despite, as Joe said, there's no clear evidence that he has ever been affiliated with any [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=66.2s)]
*  gang. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=71.36s)]
*  El Salvador's president then took a sarcastic tone himself in his social media post, writing [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=72.36s)]
*  this, Kilmar Abrego Garcia miraculously risen from the death camps and torture, now sipping [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=77.84s)]
*  Margaritas with Senator Van Hollen in the tropical paradise of El Salvador. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=83.96s)]
*  We should just note, fact check, it's unclear what they are actually drinking. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=88.83999999999999s)]
*  NBC News has reached out to Senator Van Hollen's office about this tweet. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=92.91999999999999s)]
*  El Salvador's president later added, now that he's been confirmed healthy, Abrego Garcia [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=97.32s)]
*  gets the honor of staying in El Salvador's custody. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=102.72s)]
*  So Joe, I read, there's a very interesting interview with Jack Goldsmith, the law professor [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=107.39999999999999s)]
*  at Harvard that's been done in the New York Times. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=112.44000000000001s)]
*  It's pretty lengthy, it's a podcast, but it's worth reading, particularly this section on [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=115.08000000000001s)]
*  this, just for the scenarios in how the administration is going to handle this one, how the Supreme [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=119.44000000000001s)]
*  Court might handle this, if this goes back up to the Supreme Court. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=126.28s)]
*  But it looks like in this case, so far it's been a little murky on both sides, but if [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=129.36s)]
*  it comes to a clash, how does that end up? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=134.70000000000002s)]
*  Is this a case in which the Supreme Court would be prepared to order the White House [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=137.56s)]
*  to have this man return from El Salvador, or do they choose to pick a fight over something [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=143.52s)]
*  that they feel is a clearer issue? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=149.52s)]
*  Well, I mean, you know, the thing is, the Trump administration has a lot of issues where [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=151.48s)]
*  there are people who are unambiguously gang members, people who unambiguously committed [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=158.36s)]
*  unambiguously would be so-called sort of poster child for these, what they're trying to prove [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=164.32s)]
*  here. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=172.44s)]
*  Instead, they have a man here who was sent to prison, a man who, the evidence that sent [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=173.44s)]
*  him to prison, where he was in the United States supposedly a gang member, it ended [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=183.12s)]
*  up being from a detective who was suspended, it was got the clothes that he was wearing, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=188.28s)]
*  it was also, again, the conflict between the hearsay, evidence, even had the court, again, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=193.48s)]
*  this is the most important thing, in 2019, the court let him go, never charged for a [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=204.88s)]
*  crime. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=211.96s)]
*  The court released him and gave him a special protected status. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=212.96s)]
*  It's rarely given in America. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=217.52s)]
*  The special protection status says, you are allowed to stay in America, you are not. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=220.52s)]
*  The U.S. government is not allowed to send you back to El Salvador. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=227.4s)]
*  Now, that is just clear cut. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=230.88s)]
*  And it was in 2019, it wasn't in 2023 during the Biden administration, it was 2019 during [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=232.70000000000002s)]
*  the Trump administration, and the Trump administration let the ruling stand. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=237.56s)]
*  They did not appeal it because they knew that Garcia was standing on firm legal grounds. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=243.56s)]
*  So Garcia stays in America, he reports to his immigration officer annually, he becomes [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=251.28s)]
*  a member of the union, he's a worker, he's a father. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=258.12s)]
*  Again, and you have the court saying, U.S. government, you cannot deport him. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=264.16s)]
*  Again, the Trump administration in 2019 went along with it, let it stand, didn't appeal [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=271.88s)]
*  it. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=279.79999999999995s)]
*  So this whole idea that, oh, he's a gang member, we all know he's a gang member, he's not, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=281.35999999999996s)]
*  it was never proved, never proven. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=285.2s)]
*  And you know, David Ignatius, I just want to say again, on that front, never proven, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=288.08s)]
*  but has been proven, and what has been admitted by the federal government is they made a mistake. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=297.15999999999997s)]
*  Number one, I want to talk about the foreign leaders, though. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=300.96000000000004s)]
*  And in this case, we'll talk about the president of El Salvador. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=304.92s)]
*  And I just think it's curious that foreign leaders often make the same mistake that, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=309.36s)]
*  and I know you've heard it, and I've heard it, somebody gets elected president, and everybody [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=316.52000000000004s)]
*  in Washington, D.C. for about six months thinks, well, this person's going to be president [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=320.12s)]
*  forever, and we've got to move all of our policy. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=323.92s)]
*  And then about six months, and you're like, oh, wait, yeah, gravity, yeah, it still exists. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=328.44s)]
*  Political gravity still exists. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=334.84s)]
*  I just, the contempt the president of El Salvador has for United States rule of law, the mocking [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=337.15999999999997s)]
*  of people in the United States, it's as if somebody in El Salvador hasn't told him that [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=347.4s)]
*  there are going to be elections a year from now. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=355.2s)]
*  And I think most smart money right now would say Democrats are going to do pretty well. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=358.44s)]
*  So Democrats will be funding whatever aid El Salvador gets. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=362.84s)]
*  And I find foreign leaders make this mistake time and time again. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=367.32s)]
*  They have this myopic vision. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=370.76s)]
*  This is happening in America right now. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=372.71999999999997s)]
*  American media exaggerates this, makes it seem far grimmer or far more, you know, intense [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=374.96s)]
*  than it actually may be. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=380.96s)]
*  We better put all of our chips on this side of the table. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=383.68s)]
*  And then they find out a year and a half later they're dealing with the other party when [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=387.68s)]
*  it comes to funding. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=391.88s)]
*  I just I'm just curious your thoughts about what you're seeing, the contempt out of El [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=392.88s)]
*  Salvador for a president who, whether he likes it or not, a year from now is going to be [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=398.12s)]
*  depending on Democrats, most likely for funding and aid. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=402.48s)]
*  So Joe, President Bukele was a tough guy, disdainful of law, normal procedures before [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=406.88s)]
*  Donald Trump ever got to the White House in his second term. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=414.24s)]
*  That's who he is. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=418.48s)]
*  And there's a growing movement of leaders in Central and South America who are similarly [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=419.48s)]
*  taking very harsh stands against gang members, cartels. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=425.2s)]
*  That's just the way the South and Central America is rolling right now. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=431.44s)]
*  I think what's really striking about this case is less about what's happening there, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=435.84000000000003s)]
*  which has its own momentum, than what's happening here. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=442.12s)]
*  I think we are heading into one of the great legal and constitutional events, I don't want [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=445.56s)]
*  to say crises, of my lifetime. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=452.6s)]
*  Reading the appellate opinion that Judge Harvey Wilkinson issued last night talking about [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=455.48s)]
*  this case, I've rarely seen more brilliant and thoughtful language in a judicial decision [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=460.91999999999996s)]
*  than this. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=468.44s)]
*  He says that we are, I believe his language is, grinding irrevocably towards a confrontation [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=469.44s)]
*  between the branches of government. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=477.12s)]
*  He tries to speak sympathetically to the executive branch, he speaks to the judicial branch that [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=479.4s)]
*  he represents, but you couldn't ask, I mean, I wrote to a friend a hundred years from now, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=485.64s)]
*  and people will read that decision as a model of clarity in crisis. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=490.44s)]
*  And it reassures me that our judicial system is as intact as ever, that this is going to [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=494.88s)]
*  the Supreme Court with, I think, more and more clarity about the lawlessness of the [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=500.59999999999997s)]
*  executive. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=505.71999999999997s)]
*  And that in that sense, we're heading toward this crisis not with Trump on the rise. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=506.71999999999997s)]
*  We watched the segment of Trump that we began this show with, Trump is backing away, it's [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=512.1999999999999s)]
*  a classic Trump. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=518.4399999999999s)]
*  Well, I don't know much about this. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=519.48s)]
*  That's what he says when he's about to lose. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=521.08s)]
*  You know, he's just, it's not my problem. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=523.8800000000001s)]
*  I'm looking to others. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=526.36s)]
*  So, but I urge viewers, if you have a minute, take a look at that appellate opinion and [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=528.0s)]
*  tell me if you don't feel better about the country when you read it. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=534.44s)]
*  Well, I mean, the judicial branch has stepped forward, and again, it's pretty unambiguous. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=537.6400000000001s)]
*  I mean, again, in 2019, Judge ruled he couldn't be taken out of the country. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=544.76s)]
*  Trump administration then obviously agreed they didn't appeal it. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=550.88s)]
*  Trump administration this time said, we made a mistake. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=555.32s)]
*  And again, it's just like the signal gate thing, know when to say, hey, we made a mistake. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=557.72s)]
*  We're going to bring him back and move on. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=563.0s)]
*  I don't understand because you see the thing is, what the White House is trying to do, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=566.2s)]
*  with some of the White House at least, they're trying to make this, oh, these are left wingers. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=570.96s)]
*  I mean, this is MSNBC and CNN, this is New York Times editorial. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=575.0400000000001s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=579.0s)]
*  It's Joe Rogan, right? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=580.0s)]
*  Joe Rogan has gone out there and has been saying, what's going on here, man? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=581.44s)]
*  I don't understand this. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=586.7600000000001s)]
*  You have Ann Coulter talking about deportations of people because what they said politically. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=589.7600000000001s)]
*  She says, don't, again, Ann Coulter. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=595.2800000000001s)]
*  I thought we had a First Amendment, Ann Coulter said. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=597.7600000000001s)]
*  You've got the voice for the right wing, the National Review, just eviscerating the administration [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=601.44s)]
*  and the Justice Department and Marco Rubio on this Garcia case. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=609.0s)]
*  You have Murdoch's Wall Street Journal editorial page constantly. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=614.0600000000001s)]
*  This again, why fight on a ground where you're going to lose? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=618.72s)]
*  This is, I guess some people inside the White House are thinking just like they did at the [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=625.48s)]
*  beginning of the signal gate. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=629.7600000000001s)]
*  Oh, these are just lefties. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=631.08s)]
*  No, no, man. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=632.08s)]
*  You got town hall meetings where you've got Chuck Grassley in Iowa and he's in the middle [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=634.2s)]
*  of Iowa. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=642.4399999999999s)]
*  You got people yelling from the audience, what about that guy in El Salvador? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=645.4399999999999s)]
*  You're going to bring him back? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=649.0s)]
*  That's in the heartland of Iowa. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=650.92s)]
*  And those weren't lefties. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=655.04s)]
*  We saw. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=656.88s)]
*  At least it's on video. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=657.88s)]
*  And then you even had trade unions now throwing their political weight. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=660.6400000000001s)]
*  Because actually, they call a Brego Garcia a brother because he was a member of their [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=664.6400000000001s)]
*  union. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=670.84s)]
*  The Maryland man was in the first year of a sheet metal workers apprenticeship when [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=671.84s)]
*  mistakes happen. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=675.36s)]
*  He was mistakenly deported by immigration enforcement. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=678.88s)]
*  Now his union, the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=682.32s)]
*  workers want him back. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=687.4s)]
*  And last week, the president of North America's Building Trades Union received a standing [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=690.88s)]
*  ovation when he called for a Brego Garcia's return. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=695.04s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=698.88s)]
*  You want to build a five billion dollar data center? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=700.88s)]
*  What more six fill your careers with health care retirement and no college debt? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=703.68s)]
*  You don't call Elon Musk. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=708.0799999999999s)]
*  You call us. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=709.9599999999999s)]
*  North America's building trade unions. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=713.3199999999999s)]
*  And yeah, that means all of us, all of us, including our brother, smart apprentice, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=717.04s)]
*  Kilmar Arbrega Garcia, who we demand to be returned to us in his family now. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=724.28s)]
*  Bring him home. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=729.1999999999999s)]
*  Gene Robinson, I mean, just not a fight. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=732.0s)]
*  They need to be fighting. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=734.4s)]
*  They're wrong on the law. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=735.76s)]
*  They're wrong on the facts. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=737.1999999999999s)]
*  They're wrong. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=739.0s)]
*  I mean, there are a lot of fights to win here. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=740.0s)]
*  This, as we've said on this show every day, is a political winner with Americans as far [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=743.96s)]
*  as getting we've all said it, getting violent gang members out of this country. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=748.2s)]
*  We've said it from the very beginning. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=754.48s)]
*  There are fights to be had on this issue politically that they can fight and win. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=756.16s)]
*  It's just that one of them is that I mean, when you see images like that, we have Joe [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=760.12s)]
*  Rogan, when you have all of these other people on the on the right or some on the far right [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=764.6s)]
*  saying, come on, deport them. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=769.8000000000001s)]
*  We want them deported, but do it the right way, the way nine Supreme Court justices are [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=772.36s)]
*  saying you need to do it. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YriVHdlOm1g&t=777.6800000000001s)]
