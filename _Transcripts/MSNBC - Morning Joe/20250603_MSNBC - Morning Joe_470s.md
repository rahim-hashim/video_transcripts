# Joe: DOGE ignored the rules and made things worse in Washington
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM)
*  Despite Doge's vow to make the federal government more efficient, a new Washington Post report [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=0.0s)]
*  reveals the department's new procedures and requirements are doing just the opposite. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=5.92s)]
*  According to interviews conducted by the Post, federal staffers throughout the government are [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=11.84s)]
*  being hit with new layers of red tape, and employees say they are spending hours justifying [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=16.32s)]
*  the most basic purchases. At NASA, for example, employees tell the Post they recently wrote [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=24.08s)]
*  several detailed paragraphs across multiple rounds of emails to win approval to buy simple [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=30.48s)]
*  fastening bolts, and that the Food and Drug Administration once routine tests on food were [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=37.36s)]
*  delayed because of a requirement to get department-level approval for expenses like [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=42.96s)]
*  supplies. Employees say the new rules mandating a review and approval by political appointees [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=48.96s)]
*  are leading to thousands of contracts and projects being held up for months, and large-scale [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=54.96s)]
*  firings spearheaded by Doge have cut support offices that assisted federal workers with issues [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=62.32s)]
*  ranging from glitching computers to broken desk chairs. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=68.56s)]
*  Health Care System [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=159.28s)]
*  Doge and Elon Musk are not looking. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=160.32s)]
*  Let's bring it right now. NBC News, National Affairs Analyst, and partner in chief, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=176.08s)]
*  John A. Heilman. John, these are all things that we all predicted before. When Donald Trump [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=181.35999999999999s)]
*  reportedly turns and says, was this all just BS, the saving of a trillion? Yes, it was. Yes, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=197.92s)]
*  it was BS. We told everybody it was BS. I said time and again when they said, oh, they may save [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=204.32s)]
*  up to $2 trillion. That's what I heard in December. Then they may save up to a trillion dollars. I [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=210.8s)]
*  keep saying, no, maybe you'll find $100 billion. Maybe you'll find $150 billion. You're not going [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=217.36s)]
*  to find $2 trillion. There's not $2 trillion there. You're not going to find $1 trillion. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=222.32s)]
*  There's not $1 trillion there. Instead, what they do is they do all these random cuts that end up [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=226.16s)]
*  hurting so many people. And I'm not talking about the federal employees who, yes, they're Americans, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=231.12s)]
*  too, many of whom have dedicated their entire life to being public servants thrown out for [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=237.68s)]
*  random reasons, but they actually end up hurting the constituents that they're supposed to be [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=243.36s)]
*  representing. And here we find now that after Elon Musk leaves, you've got a bureaucracy that's even [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=248.56s)]
*  less efficient because of the new bureaucratic snafus that he's laid out there for a reduced [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=256.0s)]
*  workforce. Yes, all true, Joe. And you could play the tape back and hear everyone on this show, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=265.68s)]
*  led by you and with Willie and Mika and me all chiming in saying this is all unrealistic. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=274.48s)]
*  But I think if you haven't even added in yet the costs of all the legal stuff that's gone on around [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=280.24s)]
*  this, all of the court challenges, all of the things that were halted that had to be restarted, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=288.16s)]
*  all of the various critical agencies that got shut down or where people got fired, then they had [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=294.24s)]
*  to be rehired. And what the costs of firing and rehiring people who work for nuclear regulatory [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=299.92s)]
*  agency and stuff like that. I think when the whole thing is said and done, it's going to net out, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=305.52s)]
*  not only that the savings have been minuscule, in fact, they're not going to be savings. In fact, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=309.92s)]
*  it ended up having cost the taxpayer a ton of money. I haven't gone through this exercise. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=314.56s)]
*  But the most interesting thing is the thing you said about Donald Trump, because all I'm focused [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=320.08s)]
*  on now is what happens between now and next November. There is no doubt that Elon Musk and [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=325.91999999999996s)]
*  Doge are going to be at the center of the Democratic attempts to retake the House. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=332.88s)]
*  Are Elon Musk and Donald Trump going to stay together or are we seeing the signs of an [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=336.71999999999997s)]
*  increasingly growing split? That question, was he always just full of BS? That's the first stage of [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=341.12s)]
*  not just a separation, but a divorce, I think, between Donald Trump and Elon Musk. And when these [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=348.16s)]
*  two turn on each other, God knows what's going to happen to the politics for the Republican party. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=352.24s)]
*  Yeah, we'll be following this. It's hard to see exactly what Elon Musk did in terms of efficiency [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=357.20000000000005s)]
*  and waste rather than just come to Washington and hurt a lot of people around the world and [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=362.96000000000004s)]
*  in the United States and then leave. It doesn't work that way. It just doesn't work that way. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=368.48s)]
*  There are rules and people think that, you know, there's a column this morning talking about, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=373.28000000000003s)]
*  I think it's in the Wall Street Journal, the rule of physics, the rule of economics. There are rules [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=380.56s)]
*  and there are rules in Washington. There's a way to do things. There's a way not to do things. And [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=384.64000000000004s)]
*  if you do things wrong and you think you can change 240 years of history, of tradition, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=388.56s)]
*  of the way Washington works in a blink of an eye, you're going to do things that end up making [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=395.92s)]
*  the situation even worse. That's exactly what happened. And again, anybody that's been around [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=402.64s)]
*  for more than five minutes could have told you that. That's what's so frustrating here again. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=407.36s)]
*  They're sitting here. How in the world can somebody as smart as Elon Musk come to Washington, D.C., [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=411.52s)]
*  look at the budget with all the people around and say, hey, I'm going to cut $2 trillion. Just go [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=417.2s)]
*  on to AI, ask, hey, can you cut $2 trillion from these agencies? No, no. You'd be laughed, you'd [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=422.56s)]
*  be laughed off your phone by a chat GBT. It's ridiculous they ever thought this was going to [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=430.08s)]
*  happen. So they ended up not saving money, not substantially at all, and again, creating another [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=438.64s)]
*  layer of bureaucracy and inefficiency, the last thing government needed. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qleWcQK4hRM&t=445.36s)]
