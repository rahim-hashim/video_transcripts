# ICE took public safety threats off the street in Los Angeles: Border czar
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE)
*  Joining us now, Borders are for the Trump administration, Tom Homan. Mr. Homan, thank you for joining us this morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=0.0s)]
*  We have now seen three days worth of wide-scale immigration enforcement in LA County, in the Fashion District, at the Home Depot there. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=6.4s)]
*  When your appointment was announced, you said that ICE, your agency, would focus on national security threats and public safety threats. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=15.6s)]
*  Were there public safety threats in the Fashion District and at that Home Depot in these raids we've seen? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=23.1s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I was talking about. The Fashion District wasn't an immigration raid. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=30.1s)]
*  It was a service of three criminal warrants at locations based on a large criminal conspiracy that ICE have been investigating. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=34.3s)]
*  That has to do with money laundering, tax evasion, and customer fraud. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=41.6s)]
*  For a company under-declared over $80 million in goods, jailed or paid $17 million in fees. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=45.9s)]
*  And it's part of an overall conspiracy on numerous businesses that they believe that some of this money is being laundered in Mexico, Colombia, the fine cartel activity. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=54.2s)]
*  So this was a criminal investigation that they all responded to in the beginning. That's how it all started. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=64.1s)]
*  But the facts never got out. Even though we put the facts out in the media and it covered it, they just said immigration raids and it was separating families and all the negative information were here all the time. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=69.1s)]
*  We took a lot of bad people off the street last couple of days. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=80.8s)]
*  A Vietnamese national that attended a graduation party was kicked out and came back and killed two young people, two young Americans. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=83.10000000000001s)]
*  We arrested a child predator. We arrested someone for sexual misconduct. Someone arrested for committed armed robbery. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=91.9s)]
*  We arrested numerous gang members. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=101.10000000000001s)]
*  What ICE did the last couple of days is make Los Angeles safer by taking public safety threats off the street. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=102.9s)]
*  Does everyone that has been arrested by ICE agents have a criminal record like those you described? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=108.7s)]
*  Absolutely not. And I said from day one, January 20th, we will prioritize public safety threats and national security threats. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=115.10000000000001s)]
*  However, we will enforce law, I may prioritize my family life over my work, doesn't matter, nor my work. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=122.7s)]
*  We're going to force immigration on. We've been asked about that from day one, especially in sanctuary cities. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=130.6s)]
*  Well, we can't get the bad guy in the safety and security of a jail. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=136.2s)]
*  They release him to the street. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=139.92s)]
*  Well, we got to go to the street and find him. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=140.92s)]
*  And when we find him, many times with others. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  Others are in the United States, may not be a criminal target, but guess what? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=145.95999999999998s)]
*  If ICE is there, arrest that bad guy, other elements are there, we're going to arrest [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=150.35999999999999s)]
*  them. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=154.67999999999998s)]
*  That's what sanctuary cities get. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=155.67999999999998s)]
*  They put us in the neighborhood, they force the neighborhood. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=156.67999999999998s)]
*  This is what happens. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=159.67999999999998s)]
*  Well, that sort of action there you're describing has met with a lot of pushback from local [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=160.67999999999998s)]
*  officials, the mayor of Los Angeles and the governor, who's also very critical of the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=164.36s)]
*  National Guard being deployed, suggesting that's provoking some of these some of these [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=168.20000000000002s)]
*  clashes. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=172.88000000000002s)]
*  It's sort of it is a rarely used maneuver by the president, United States to deploy [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=173.88000000000002s)]
*  National Guard members like this over the objections of the governor to the city streets. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=177.72000000000003s)]
*  Mr. Holman, were you part of the decision making process to deploy the National Guard? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=183.12s)]
*  What is your response to those in that state who say they're only making the situation [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=187.68s)]
*  worse? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=192.52s)]
*  Then they should have taken action last two days while the city burned. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=193.68s)]
*  I mean, he waited over two days for all this violence to say he had an unlawful assembly. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=196.60000000000002s)]
*  I mean, I was there when a thousand protesters were surrounding the federal building, breaching [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=201.60000000000002s)]
*  that federal building, putting our officers at risk, putting the aliens to be arrested [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  and they were in custody at risk. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=211.4s)]
*  It was out of control. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=212.76000000000002s)]
*  So I support President Trump's decision on deploying the National Guard. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=214.44s)]
*  They're there to protect property and life, not just some law enforcement officers you [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=218.08s)]
*  see being attacked the last couple of days to protect citizens too. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=222.76s)]
*  So if they fail to control that city and we're there, we're going to do everything we can [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=227.04s)]
*  to protect our buildings, protect our officers. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=232.2s)]
*  And so the National Guard, I think, is the right thing to do. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=234.2s)]
*  I was on the ground. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=237.12s)]
*  Governor Newsom wasn't. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=238.12s)]
*  I've seen this for the first couple of days. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=239.12s)]
*  He didn't. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=242.72s)]
*  So I think President Trump made the right decision to deploy the National Guard to protect [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=243.72s)]
*  life and property. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=246.96s)]
*  That's exactly what they're doing. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=248.44s)]
*  And these people that are, you know, they call them protesters, many are peaceful protesters. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=250.16s)]
*  Many are not. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=255.0s)]
*  Many are criminals. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=256.0s)]
*  We had an incident where someone threw a Molotov cocktail at a law enforcement officer. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=257.08s)]
*  Now we've just seen recently what a Molotov cocktail can do. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=262.16s)]
*  So what I've said from, you know, I've been attacked for a couple of days, but the red [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=265.68s)]
*  light keeps continuing, the violence keeps continuing. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=269.2s)]
*  It's a matter of time before someone loses their life. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=271.36s)]
*  So usually a Molotov cocktail officer can certainly be met with deadly force. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=274.78s)]
*  The rhetoric has to stop. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=280.14s)]
*  People have to stop calling ICE terrorists and criminals and racists because they're [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=281.9s)]
*  enforcing the laws enacted by Congress, signed by a president. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=286.5s)]
*  And that's exactly what ICE is doing. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=290.65999999999997s)]
*  They're enforcing the law. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=292.02s)]
*  They're not making this up. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=293.02s)]
*  They're trying to make everything safer, one illegal criminal at a time. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=294.02s)]
*  And we should say, officials there, Governor Mayer, also the commissioner of the LAPD, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=297.73999999999995s)]
*  says that the vast majority of protesters there have been peaceful. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=301.38s)]
*  Mr. Holm, I want to talk about a new tactic here from ICE in recent weeks, it seems. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=305.21999999999997s)]
*  Some arrests made at immigration courts, also at schools across the country. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=311.62s)]
*  We've seen Michigan, Massachusetts, a couple in New York City. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=315.58s)]
*  Are those students, you know, many of the teenagers for the most, are they public safety [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=320.54s)]
*  threats? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=325.5s)]
*  Why are they now being targeted at places where used to be children were felt safe? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=326.5s)]
*  What do you say to parents who now say they're afraid to send their kids to school? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=330.66s)]
*  Well, it's ridiculous. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=333.58000000000004s)]
*  Against the policy, they're being pushed by the media. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=334.58000000000004s)]
*  You know, ICE secretary Noem ended the sense of location policy that ICE had. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=337.74s)]
*  Only federal law enforcement agencies had such a policy that law enforcement couldn't [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=344.06s)]
*  enter a college campus, couldn't enter a medical facility to arrest a public safety threat. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=349.18s)]
*  And you can't point at one instance where ICE has raided a school. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=354.38s)]
*  I see the stories, raided elementary school, never happened. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=358.9s)]
*  Raided church, it doesn't happen. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=361.65999999999997s)]
*  Raided hospital, it doesn't happen. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=362.97999999999996s)]
*  However, I'll say this. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=364.38s)]
*  We did away with that policy because there's no sanctuary in this country for a significant [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=366.17999999999995s)]
*  public safety threat or national security threat. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=370.58s)]
*  There's no sanctuary. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=373.58s)]
*  And the other law enforcement agencies, for instance, let's say MS-13, he's a senior in [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=374.58s)]
*  high school, and he's a public safety threat. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=379.78s)]
*  When we've been looking for him, now we know he's actually attending class today at a certain [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=381.78s)]
*  time. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=385.05999999999995s)]
*  We're going to work with local authorities to go arrest that public safety threat. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=386.34s)]
*  It's not about raiding schools, about raiding hospitals. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=388.86s)]
*  It's about, in a rare circumstance, we've got to find a public safety threat, national [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=391.86s)]
*  security threat, and they're in one of the facilities, we're going to arrest them. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=395.98s)]
*  Again, there's no sanctuary for public safety threats or national security threats. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=399.06s)]
*  So it's not about raids. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=403.98s)]
*  It's not about, so people should send their kids to school. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=404.98s)]
*  We're not raiding schools. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=408.5s)]
*  It's just a ridiculous concept that lets us push that false narrative. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=409.5s)]
*  Some of these students, of course, you're not gang members, those who have been detained. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=413.5s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=416.29999999999995s)]
*  You, of course, work for the Obama administration, an administration that was very successful [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=417.29999999999995s)]
*  in securing the border, deporting a lot of people, even that Democrats were critical [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=421.05999999999995s)]
*  of the administration for doing so. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=426.14s)]
*  But a lot of the tactics being used now by the Trump administration were not used then, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=428.34s)]
*  when things were, when those numbers were high, higher than they are now. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=432.73999999999995s)]
*  So why have things changed under President Trump? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=436.28s)]
*  Is there indeed some sort of quota system put forth by Stephen Miller or others? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=440.18s)]
*  Look, I did run enforcement and remove operations to Obama, and we removed the rest of a lot [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=444.18s)]
*  of people, and we used a lot of the same tactics. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=451.58000000000004s)]
*  Right now, because over the last four years of Joe Biden, we got over 10 million new aliens [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=454.58000000000004s)]
*  coming to this country illegally, and we got over 2 million known gotaways, 2 million people [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=458.94s)]
*  that crossed that border weren't vetted, weren't fingerprinted. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=464.22s)]
*  We don't know who the hell they are. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=466.66s)]
*  How many of them came from country response and terror? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=468.34000000000003s)]
*  We had over 400 people on terrorist response tests, rest on the southern border, four years [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=470.74s)]
*  under Joe Biden, and then to the end of the Trump administration, first Trump administration, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=474.22s)]
*  we had 14. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=478.02000000000004s)]
*  So the situation is totally different. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=479.02000000000004s)]
*  So we got a lot of dangerous people released in this country, and we've seen it, case example [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=481.40000000000003s)]
*  by case example, of illegal aliens released in this country with a second term of myocardism [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=485.3s)]
*  and they're properly vetted, and they weren't. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=489.66s)]
*  Because when we found them, they had serious criminal histories in their homeland. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=491.54s)]
*  So second term of myocardism said these people were probably vetted, and no they weren't. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=496.3s)]
*  We never had access to many countries' criminal databases. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=499.34000000000003s)]
*  Many of the countries where these aliens come from don't have any criminal database at all. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=503.18s)]
*  They don't have the systems we had. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=506.94s)]
*  So it's a different ballgame right now. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=508.54s)]
*  The last four years of Biden administration, open borders, we know that public safety threats [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=510.5s)]
*  by the tens of thousands of people entering this country, national security threats made [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=515.5s)]
*  in this country, and again, 2 million people paid more to get away. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=519.98s)]
*  They didn't pay less to an alien smuggler organization to get a free airline ticket [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=524.38s)]
*  to the city of their choice, a free hotel room, three meals a day, free medical care [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=528.3s)]
*  and work authorization. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=532.6999999999999s)]
*  2 million people paid more not to get vetted, not to get fingerprinted. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=533.6999999999999s)]
*  So it's a different ballgame. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=537.7399999999999s)]
*  So we're taking this seriously, and ICE is not making this up. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=539.0999999999999s)]
*  Everything we're doing, warriors on laws established by Congress, enacted by Congress, and signed [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=542.6999999999999s)]
*  by a president. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=547.3s)]
*  Even the Alien Enemies Act, there are a lot of people attacking, Congress passed that [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=548.3s)]
*  act. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=551.8599999999999s)]
*  That act is codified, and we're using every tool available to identify and remove as many [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=553.54s)]
*  public safety threats and national security threats as we can. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=559.38s)]
*  Certainly, you know, some of the critics of these moves say that these policies, those [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=562.3000000000001s)]
*  laws, Alien Enemies Act and the like were not meant for this. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=565.98s)]
*  One of the toughest critics right now is, of course, California Governor Newsom. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=569.0600000000001s)]
*  We want to give you a chance to respond. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=572.82s)]
*  Governor Newsom, in an interview with NBC News, said that he was said, quote, just get it [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=574.94s)]
*  over with in terms of you arresting him. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=579.66s)]
*  He says, quote, he's a tough guy. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=583.06s)]
*  Why doesn't he do it? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=584.6999999999999s)]
*  He knows where to find me. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=585.8199999999999s)]
*  So Tom, arrest me. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=587.38s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=589.5799999999999s)]
*  That was the governor of California talking to you. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=590.5799999999999s)]
*  Look, I'm not biting on that. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=593.18s)]
*  The NBC reporter that interviewed me, very dishonest. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=595.3399999999999s)]
*  We did a 20-minute interview, and it cuts out a little clip that makes me and takes [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=598.14s)]
*  my words out of context. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=603.14s)]
*  Here's what we said. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=604.78s)]
*  And he talked about what I talked about these people that are these protests and rioting. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=606.38s)]
*  When they cross the line, they got, well, here's why I said they have a right to protest. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=610.26s)]
*  They have the First Amendment rights, but they can't cross that line. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=613.34s)]
*  They can't cross that line of impediment. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=616.46s)]
*  They can't cross that line of putting their hands on officers. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=618.1s)]
*  They can't cross the line of knowingly concealing and illegal amic. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=620.82s)]
*  Because they're all federal crimes. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=623.9s)]
*  They're all, they're in statute. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=625.3s)]
*  And they will be prosecuted. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=627.02s)]
*  When he asked the questions that include Mayor Bassett, Governor Newsom, and I was clear, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=628.02s)]
*  they haven't crossed the line. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=633.42s)]
*  But they're not above the law either. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=635.3s)]
*  If they commit a crime, they're certainly asked for prosecution. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=637.06s)]
*  That's what was happening. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=640.14s)]
*  I never threatened or arrested Governor Newsom, so I'm not biting off on that. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=641.14s)]
*  That reporter is dishonest. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=645.26s)]
*  And let him play the whole 20-minute interview, and you'll see a whole different discussion [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=646.26s)]
*  that we had. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=652.9399999999999s)]
*  All right. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=653.9399999999999s)]
*  NBC News, of course, stands by the reporting. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=654.9399999999999s)]
*  Borders are. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=656.3399999999999s)]
*  Tom Homan, Mr. Homan, we appreciate you joining us this morning. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=657.3399999999999s)]
*  We'll talk to you again. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=659.8599999999999s)]
*  You got it. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=660.8599999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ZQyls4DaE&t=661.8599999999999s)]
