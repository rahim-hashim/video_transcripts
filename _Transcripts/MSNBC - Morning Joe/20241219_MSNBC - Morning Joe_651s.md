# Steve Rattner: Elon Musk's wealth soars after Trump's win
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [December 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0)
*  This president-elect Donald Trump's election win has been extremely profitable for Elon [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=0.0s)]
*  Musk, whose net worth has grown by $276 billion since November 5th, meaning Musk's net worth [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=5.0s)]
*  now has inched closer to nearly half a trillion dollars. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=12.52s)]
*  Steve Ratner has some charts on this. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=16.56s)]
*  Steve, what are you looking at? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=18.68s)]
*  So, not only is Elon Musk maybe the second or even the first most powerful man in Washington, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=19.68s)]
*  he's also the richest man in the world, as you just suggested. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=24.76s)]
*  So let's take a look at why. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=28.28s)]
*  It's principally because of two companies. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=29.96s)]
*  Tesla, his electric vehicle company, which we're all familiar with, has more than doubled [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=32.0s)]
*  its market value literally since the election. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=38.4s)]
*  You can see down here the stock price was kind of piddling along, and now it just shot [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=40.84s)]
*  up after the election. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=45.24s)]
*  The company is now worth 25 times what General Motors is worth, even though it produces far [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=46.72s)]
*  fewer cars. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=52.56s)]
*  Why did it shoot up like that? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=53.78s)]
*  Musk is obviously counting on government policy to help him keep out Chinese imports, put [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=56.4s)]
*  in other EV regulations that will favor Tesla, and so buyers buy it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=61.24s)]
*  His other company, which may not be as familiar to people as SpaceX, because it is the most [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=66.04s)]
*  valuable private company in the world. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=70.84s)]
*  SpaceX only does its valuation twice a year because it's not publicly traded, but what's [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=73.56s)]
*  happened since the election is it's raised some more money at a value that is 67% higher [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=78.48s)]
*  than what it raised it at just six months earlier, so 67% up in one six-month period. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=84.67999999999999s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=91.24s)]
*  Because SpaceX obviously is heavily dependent on government contracts and government support [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=92.36s)]
*  for its launches. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=96.88s)]
*  In fact, the new head of NASA, the proposed head of NASA, has been on a SpaceX rocket [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=97.88s)]
*  twice and is an investor in SpaceX, so kind of imagine they're going to get more or less [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=103.24s)]
*  what they want. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=108.32s)]
*  And so that is now a $350 billion company, the most valuable private company in the world, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=109.32s)]
*  as I said. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=114.44s)]
*  So when you put it together, what do you have? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=115.48s)]
*  Musk has Tesla shares, he's got SpaceX, he's got Tesla options, which are just another [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=117.6s)]
*  piece of this puzzle, and then he's got a bunch of stuff that looks pretty small here, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=123.0s)]
*  but it's $7 billion, it's $13 billion, it's $25 billion in OpenAI, in X as we know, in [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=127.0s)]
*  some futuristic things called The Boring Company, and NeuroLink, all of which have gone up enormously [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=133.16s)]
*  in value. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=138.86s)]
*  And so as you said in your lead-in, what's happened? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=140.02s)]
*  His net worth has gone up 135% since the election, $276 billion. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=143.3s)]
*  He's now worth $480 billion, the wealthiest man in the world, half of that roughly since [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=149.78s)]
*  the election alone. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=156.70000000000002s)]
*  Wow, stunning. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=157.94s)]
*  And Steve, you mentioned this with SpaceX and NASA, but conflicts of interest really [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=159.06s)]
*  concern a lot of people. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=163.5s)]
*  If he is running this so-called Doge agency, he could. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=164.70000000000002s)]
*  Could he not have the power to, say, pull federal funding or pull federal contracts [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=168.52s)]
*  from a competing EV company, for example? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=173.12s)]
*  Yeah, this is sort of so far off the fairway, you're never even going to find this ball. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  When you work in the government, and I did this, you are subject to rigid conflict of [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=180.60000000000002s)]
*  interest rules. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=185.24s)]
*  You are required to divest yourself of anything that could prove a conflict in your work for [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=186.24s)]
*  the government. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=191.44s)]
*  Obviously, he's not going to divest all this stuff. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=192.44s)]
*  He's not even a government employee, which is a whole other legal question as to what [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=194.64s)]
*  he can or should be doing. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=198.67999999999998s)]
*  And so this is another classic example of kind of the swamp coming to Washington, and [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=200.48s)]
*  Trump and his people doing whatever they feel like, regardless of what's appropriate, regardless [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=205.92s)]
*  of what even the law is in some cases, perhaps. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=209.95999999999998s)]
*  That's really working for Elon Musk so far. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=212.56s)]
*  So Steve, let's get to some more of your charts on the Federal Reserve, which announced yesterday [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=214.88s)]
*  it has cut interest rates by an additional quarter of a percentage point, its third and [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=219.2s)]
*  final rate cut for 2024. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=223.9s)]
*  Fed Chair Jerome Powell telling reporters the latest cut, not an easy decision. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=225.82000000000002s)]
*  I would say today was a closer call, but we decided it was the right call because we thought [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=232.18s)]
*  it was the best decision to foster achievement of both of our goals, maximum employment and [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=238.10000000000002s)]
*  price stability. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=244.3s)]
*  We see the risks as two sided, moving too slowly and needlessly undermine economic activity [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=245.3s)]
*  in the labor market or move too quickly and needlessly undermine our progress on inflation. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=251.06s)]
*  So we're trying to steer between those two risks. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=255.9s)]
*  The stock market plunged after yesterday's announcement with all three major indexes [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=258.94s)]
*  having their worst day in months. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=263.86s)]
*  Chairman Powell also indicated rate cuts are likely to slow down in the new year. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=265.46s)]
*  Steve now back at the table with more charts to help break this down. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=270.22s)]
*  So expected at a quarter of a percentage point, I think, Steve, right? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=273.86s)]
*  I guess the reason the markets went down though is because of that idea that this would be [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=278.34000000000003s)]
*  the end of these cuts for a while. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=281.98s)]
*  Yeah, and it was unexpected what the Fed said. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=283.62s)]
*  I think the market was expecting that the Fed's new set of projections, which we can [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=286.14s)]
*  talk about, we're going to provide for four cuts next year and instead the market's projections [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=290.42s)]
*  now only for one cut, for two cuts, excuse me, next year. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=295.90000000000003s)]
*  So what this chart shows you is simply the path of interest rates and you can see that [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=300.46000000000004s)]
*  they peaked at about five and a half percent and they've come down over the past year by [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=304.22s)]
*  a full percentage point. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=308.3s)]
*  I put in the mortgage rate because some people may say, well, why haven't mortgages come [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=309.94000000000005s)]
*  down? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=313.58000000000004s)]
*  Mortgages haven't come down because they are actually tied more to the 30-year Treasury, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=314.74s)]
*  which is in fact going up somewhat in yield rather than down. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=319.22s)]
*  But if you take a look at this next chart, you'll see that what the market had been expecting [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=324.24s)]
*  was much lower interest rates sooner and that all the way at the bottom is September and [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=330.84s)]
*  what people thought in September was going to happen to interest rates and then you can [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=335.9s)]
*  see each succeeding quarter passing, three-month period passing, expectations of rates are [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=340.0s)]
*  saying higher and higher. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=346.46s)]
*  Why do people think, and why does the Fed in particular, think rates may not go down [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=347.65999999999997s)]
*  as fast as we thought? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=352.62s)]
*  It's kind of good news in a way. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=354.15999999999997s)]
*  It's because the economy has actually been stronger than people expected and then the [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=355.91999999999996s)]
*  Fed expected, which you can see a bit on the next chart where they've changed their [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=360.52s)]
*  projections and they're now expecting that the economy will grow, that's this black line, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=364.52s)]
*  by 2.5% next year rather than the 2% that they projected previously. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=370.71999999999997s)]
*  So the market and the Fed, for that matter more importantly, think the economy is a bit [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=376.15999999999997s)]
*  stronger. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=380.68s)]
*  On the negative side of it, on the next chart, you can see what they were thinking about [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=381.68s)]
*  inflation. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=385.2s)]
*  The Fed just three months ago thought inflation would come down to 2%, which is their target [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=386.28s)]
*  next year. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=391.52s)]
*  Now they think inflation, which is kind of stuck in the three range, is only going to [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=392.71999999999997s)]
*  come down to 2.5%. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=396.67999999999995s)]
*  So that is part of why Powell said what he said in his opening comments about it. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=398.84s)]
*  Now why did the stock market go down so much? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=404.4s)]
*  Because higher interest rates are the enemy of stock prices. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=407.03999999999996s)]
*  When interest rates go up or don't go down as fast as you expect, people move their money [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=410.38s)]
*  into bonds and to money market funds and other things that pay an interest rate they view [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=415.74s)]
*  as more attractive than stocks. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=420.1s)]
*  And so the stock market was really kind of shocked a bit obviously by the news yesterday [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=422.34000000000003s)]
*  that rates are not going to come down as fast as they thought and that's why the market [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=427.64000000000004s)]
*  rolled over. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=432.26s)]
*  So Steve, I imagine another person not thrilled with this news is going to be President-elect [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=433.26s)]
*  Donald Trump who prizes the stock market greatly, who if inflation does stay higher that's going [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=436.86s)]
*  to make it that much more challenging for his promise to lower prices. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=442.26s)]
*  It also calls into question his relationship with the Fed because we know that he has suggested [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=445.7s)]
*  he wants far more influence over the Fed, even control over the Fed. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=449.86s)]
*  Jerome Powell though has said no. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=453.78s)]
*  Yeah, those are all great points of course Jonathan. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=455.38s)]
*  So first, in a way Trump got a little bit of a break. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=457.86s)]
*  The stock market took its pain this year rather than next year and if this is the end of the [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=460.4s)]
*  stock market decline, and obviously we don't know, then his watch starts on January 20th [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=465.06s)]
*  of course. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=471.21999999999997s)]
*  Secondly, it's important to note that I think the Fed was pretty clear yesterday that everything [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=472.22s)]
*  they did has nothing to do with Trump's proposals. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=476.74s)]
*  Trump's proposals would actually make all of this worse because he wants tariffs which [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=480.58000000000004s)]
*  are a tax, create inflation, he wants to spend, he wants to cut taxes a lot more. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=484.78000000000003s)]
*  That would raise the budget deficit, that puts pressure on rates. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=490.5s)]
*  He wants to deport people, that hurts the labor force which forces wages up and creates [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=494.02000000000004s)]
*  more inflation. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=499.34000000000003s)]
*  So all of this is actually not even taking into account what he might do. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=500.5s)]
*  So he may have even more pain ahead of him. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=504.54s)]
*  And yes, he will take on the Fed. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=507.06s)]
*  He can't fire Jerome Powell. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=509.06s)]
*  Jerome Powell has already said, I ain't going. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=510.46s)]
*  He's got about another 15 or 16 months to go and then Trump can obviously put his guy [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=512.86s)]
*  in. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=517.58s)]
*  But you can't fight the Fed in a way. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=518.58s)]
*  What the Fed is doing is necessary. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=521.98s)]
*  And if you put someone in there, and we've had this before, who doesn't respond to the [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=523.9s)]
*  inflationary pressures by keeping rates higher, who doesn't do the right thing, not what the [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=527.7s)]
*  president necessarily wants, you could have real economic chaos. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=532.7800000000001s)]
*  So Steve, we've seen, and Elon Musk is a large example of this and an imperfect example of [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=536.7800000000001s)]
*  this, but whenever anything happens, the rich always get richer somehow. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=541.6600000000001s)]
*  And the average American family stumbles along. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=546.1400000000001s)]
*  What does the rocky relationship that exists between President Trump, President-elect Trump, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=548.62s)]
*  and Chairman Powell? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=554.94s)]
*  How does that impact the average American family? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=556.86s)]
*  The average American family has a mortgage. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=561.38s)]
*  They may have credit card debt or an automobile loan. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=566.0600000000001s)]
*  And a lot of these policies that Trump is pursuing, as I said, could keep interest rates [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=569.74s)]
*  higher for longer or even push them up altogether. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=574.58s)]
*  And that's the impact on the American family. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=577.7s)]
*  And then, of course, you get the question, what is the impact on the economy? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=580.2600000000001s)]
*  And things like tariffs slow the economy, slow economic growth, cost jobs. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=584.28s)]
*  Deporting immigrants, you may think is good for the average American worker. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=588.72s)]
*  It's not, because you end up with worker shortages, and the economy, again, slows, and you get [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=593.36s)]
*  more inflation. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=597.6s)]
*  So none of this, in my opinion anyway, is good for the American family. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=598.96s)]
*  And then on top of that, Trump's tax proposals are highly regressive, meaning that people [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=602.64s)]
*  at the rich would get a much larger percentage increase in their after-tax income than people [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=607.52s)]
*  at the bottom. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=613.04s)]
*  Well, he did it before. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=614.3199999999999s)]
*  The 2017 tax cut, which he wants to extend, essentially did the same thing. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=615.3199999999999s)]
*  It basically gave more to people at the top, even in percentage terms, let alone in dollars, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=620.52s)]
*  than to people at the bottom. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=625.5999999999999s)]
*  And as you mentioned, tariffs would raise prices as well. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=626.5999999999999s)]
*  So that's all in the stew. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmudb00Bc0&t=629.26s)]
