# 'Morally wrong, politically suicidal': Republican senator says no Medicaid cuts
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w)
*  Capitol Hill three GOP led House committees have advanced legislation that's set to be combined [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=0.0s)]
*  into President Trump's one big beautiful bill tackling his legislative agenda. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=5.68s)]
*  Despite in fighting among party members, Republicans are moving forward with cuts to taxes, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=11.44s)]
*  Medicaid and food assistance after several marathon markup sessions. President Trump weighed in last [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=17.92s)]
*  night on Fox News and suggested the final bill could get Democratic support. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=25.44s)]
*  I think a lot of Democrats are going to be forced to vote for the bill because, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=31.28s)]
*  you know, you add this new element that if this bill passes, you're going to get a 50 to 90 percent [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=34.400000000000006s)]
*  reduction in prescription drugs and pharmaceuticals. When you add that in, how does a Democrat not vote? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=40.8s)]
*  I don't think they can win an election if they don't vote for it. But even if you don't include [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=49.36s)]
*  it, I think that the Republicans are very unified and something would happen where they will get this [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=54.48s)]
*  vote. Meanwhile, Republican Senator Josh Hawley is warning his own party over its push to make [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=60.0s)]
*  potential cuts to Medicaid. In a guest essay for the New York Times, Hawley wrote in part this, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=65.68s)]
*  Mr. Trump has promised working class tax cuts and protection for working class social insurance, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=72.32s)]
*  such as Medicaid. But now a noisy contingent of corporatist Republicans, call it the party's [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=79.84s)]
*  Wall Street wing, is urging Congress to ignore all that and get back to the old time religion, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=86.16s)]
*  corporate giveaways, preferences for capital and deep cuts to social insurance. The wing of the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=92.64s)]
*  party wants Republicans to build our big, beautiful bill around slashing health insurance for the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=99.2s)]
*  working poor. But that argument is both morally wrong and politically suicidal. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=105.28s)]
*  Hawley has continued to speak about the potential cuts yesterday during an appearance on CNN. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=111.28s)]
*  It ought to be just a basic foundational principle. It is wrong to cut health care [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=116.56s)]
*  for the working poor. And that's what we're talking about here with Medicaid. My state is [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=121.52000000000001s)]
*  a Medicaid expansion state. Over 20 percent of Missourians, including hundreds of thousands of [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=124.72s)]
*  children, are on Medicaid. And they're not on Medicaid because they want to be. They're on [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=129.76s)]
*  Medicaid because they cannot afford health insurance in the private market. These are [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=133.68s)]
*  working people and their children who need health care. And it's just wrong to go and cut their [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=138.24s)]
*  health care when they're trying to make ends meet, trying to help their kids, trying to make sure [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=143.84s)]
*  that they're able to provide for their families. So I hope that the House GOP and the Senate GOP [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=148.08s)]
*  will get the message here. I'm not going to support this bill from the House in this form. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  I think that's clear. It's got to change before it can pass the Senate. And I continue to stand [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  by my line of the sand, which is no Medicaid benefit cuts. This is real Medicaid benefit cuts. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=161.36s)]
*  I can't support that. No Republicans should support that. We're the party of the working [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=165.84s)]
*  class, Mauna. We need to act like it. Well, you know, this is something that we've been, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=169.52s)]
*  yeah, that's a wow. That's something we've been talking about on the show for quite some time that [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=173.04000000000002s)]
*  actually disproportionately Medicaid cuts, even though Republicans in the House obviously don't [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=177.04000000000002s)]
*  understand this, Medicaid cuts disproportionately impact Americans in rural communities, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=181.84s)]
*  disproportionately impact red states like Josh Hawley. You look at in rural America, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=189.04s)]
*  some estimates up to 50% of children get their primary health care from Medicaid providers. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=196.16s)]
*  When you look at where people are sending their parents and grandparents to being taken care of [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  and in nursing homes, an overwhelming majority of those in rural communities, again, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=212.72s)]
*  that's funded by Medicaid. You keep, there's already, we've had a guest on the show talking [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=221.04000000000002s)]
*  about this. There's already been a crisis in rural health care in America over the past 10, 15 years. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=227.12s)]
*  This was so exacerbating. You wonder seriously how Republicans couldn't listen, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=234.95999999999998s)]
*  can't believe I'm saying this, to Josh Hawley, couldn't listen to Josh Hawley and understand [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=241.84s)]
*  they want to slash health care benefits for their constituents in red state America to pay, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=249.44s)]
*  to pay for tax cuts for billionaires living in Silicon Valley, Palm Beach, and Manhattan. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=257.59999999999997s)]
*  Terrible. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=268.08s)]
*  It's terrible and it's also politically stupid. If you don't want to do it because [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=269.52s)]
*  it's the right thing to do it, do it for your own political preservation. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=277.12s)]
*  Be pragmatic. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=283.44s)]
*  That makes sense. Let's bring in right now opinion writer for the New York Times, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=285.03999999999996s)]
*  Frank Bruni. His recent New York Times bestselling book, The Age of Grievance, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=287.68s)]
*  is now out in paperback. Now also with his co-anchor of CNBC's Squawk Box and the New [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=292.08s)]
*  York Times columnist Andrew Sorkin. Frank, I want to start with you. We heard Josh Hawley [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=297.84s)]
*  actually saying something that should be very obvious to most Republicans, especially [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=305.03999999999996s)]
*  Republicans in deep red state America, whether you're in Missouri, whether you're in Alabama, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=310.16s)]
*  whether you're in Nebraska, wherever you are, Idaho, like Medicaid, Montana, Medicaid is a [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=315.36s)]
*  lifeline for those residents. And here you have Republicans talking about slashing Medicaid [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=322.88000000000005s)]
*  to pay for, you know, billionaires tax cuts on the coasts. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=329.44000000000005s)]
*  Which is why that big, beautiful bill has some big, unbeautiful problems, right? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=334.56s)]
*  I mean, there's long been this myth in the Republican Party that anything that smacks of [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=339.2s)]
*  the welfare state is only for voters of color in Democratic cities. And as we know from as far back [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=343.92s)]
*  as that seminal book, What's the Matter with Kansas, a lot of these programs, a lot of government [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=351.03999999999996s)]
*  assistance goes to rural areas, goes to red states. And that's a big problem in terms of passing this [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=355.59999999999997s)]
*  bill. I listened to that clip you just played of President Trump saying he can't imagine any [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=360.96s)]
*  Republican being against it. I guess he can't hear Josh Hawley's voice or read the op-ed page [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=365.92s)]
*  of the New York Times. But there is disagreement in the Republican Party. There's disagreement in [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=370.72s)]
*  the MAGA caucus. I mean, I write about this in a column that'll go up in a couple of hours, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=375.28000000000003s)]
*  but Laura Loomer has come out against the Medicaid cuts. And there's an interesting larger story here, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=379.6s)]
*  which is we always talk of MAGA, or many of us talk too frequently of the MAGA movement as a cult. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=385.12s)]
*  And it's actually quite fractious. And I think we're seeing that through the lens of this [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=391.44s)]
*  one big, beautiful bill. It sounds like a seventh grader named it. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=396.32s)]
*  It is so fractious. And you have, of course, Andrew, I'll throw this to you. You can talk about [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=401.28000000000003s)]
*  this coalition or go wherever you want to go, because you are Andrew Ross Sorkin and you remain [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=408.88s)]
*  as a media figure, too big to fail. But we've seen this fight time and time again [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=416.72s)]
*  over the last three months, the sort of divide in MAGA world. Steve Bannon's populist wing, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=423.28000000000003s)]
*  which Josh Hawley very clearly said there, who again, Steve Bannon saying positive things about [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=430.08000000000004s)]
*  AOC, saying positive things about Bernie Sanders, and actually fighting against these tax cuts, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=435.36s)]
*  saying they are absolutely terrible for the MAGA movement. Then on the other side, you have Elon [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=442.8s)]
*  Musk, you have Mark Andreessen, you have a lot of people on Wall Street who want those tax cuts. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=448.96000000000004s)]
*  And so you're seeing this divide again, whether it's tax cuts, whether it's tariffs, whether it's [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=458.88s)]
*  visas for high wage workers. Talk about that and what you see from your vantage point. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=466.08s)]
*  I think what you're seeing here is the old school, and I don't know if it's old school, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=477.68s)]
*  fiscal conservatives who say, look, there's math here and we want to somehow cut the budget. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=483.28s)]
*  We want to cut taxes, all of those things. And if you're going to do those things [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=490.56s)]
*  and you're going to try to balance the budget, if in fact that is even a goal anymore, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=495.04s)]
*  one of the things you might have to touch is Medicaid. And that's the sort of old school [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=499.20000000000005s)]
*  fiscal conservative class that's inside the White House and inside parts of Washington these days [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=504.40000000000003s)]
*  on the Republican side. But as I think you're alluding to, there is this sort of new populist [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=512.4s)]
*  movement inside of MAGA, which is almost, by the way, has in some cases a Bernie Sanders feel [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=517.36s)]
*  to it, depending on what the issue of the day is. And so there's folks who are going to say, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=525.52s)]
*  we got to keep Medicaid going. We got to keep spending and we got to lower taxes. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=532.64s)]
*  It's a very interesting thing to do because in a way it also takes away some of the argument, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=537.2s)]
*  frankly, from Democrats. So up until a week or two ago, it felt like there was actually a possibility [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=543.92s)]
*  that there would be higher taxes on the wealthy in America coming from MAGA. I mean, there are [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=549.12s)]
*  people inside the White House talking about that. That now seems to be off the table. I think [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=554.4s)]
*  partially because that's off the table, there's now a view, how are you going to pay for everything? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=559.52s)]
*  Well, how do you pay for things? Maybe you're going to have to take something off something else. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=565.04s)]
*  And that's why I think there's this now new attack on Medicaid. But that's sort of the [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=568.72s)]
*  war going on inside the White House as we speak. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFZpWCnT2w&t=574.5600000000001s)]
