# 'Apocalyptic': Pasadena fire chief describes devastation
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [January 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM)
*  Let's bring in right now Pasadena Fire Chief Chad Augustine. Chief, thank you so much for being [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=0.0s)]
*  with us during just these absolutely horrific times. I will tell you for those of us who aren't out [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=6.16s)]
*  there, it looks apocalyptic and my friends in the area say, well if you're here it looks even worse. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  Can you begin, just first of all for those on the East Coast and middle of America, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=20.0s)]
*  can you begin by telling them just the scale and scope of this tragedy? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=25.52s)]
*  Yeah, apocalyptic and good morning to you. Thank you for having me. Apocalyptic is the exact word [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=31.52s)]
*  that I've been using, especially that first night where we had amber casts making spot fires [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=36.8s)]
*  two plus miles ahead of a fire and 70 mile an hour wind gusts and trees coming down. It was just [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=46.16s)]
*  something I've never seen in my life and the amount of devastation is incredible. I'd also [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=53.28s)]
*  like to highlight the really heroic efforts, the hundreds of lives saved on the Eaton Fire [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=60.4s)]
*  by police and fire that in those first hours as they were evacuating residents who really [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=66.0s)]
*  didn't get notice as that fire spread so rapidly. But we are so grateful for the work of the fire [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=71.84s)]
*  department, police, first responders all across Southern California and coming in from other [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=79.36s)]
*  states and other countries helping out too. It seems to me, Chief, you're a great person to talk [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=85.92s)]
*  to on this next question because there's a lot of debate. Politicians on both sides are going to [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  love to come in and unfortunately start politicizing the problems here. And I've had a lot of people [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=98.72s)]
*  ask me, hey, what's happening? Why don't they have enough water? But I'm wondering, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=105.2s)]
*  obviously there will be politicians to blame not only that are serving now but have served over the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=112.8s)]
*  last 30 years. I am wondering though, what can you do, what can fire departments do when you're [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=117.36s)]
*  dealing with wildfires from wild areas and winds going up to a hundred miles an hour? I just can't [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=125.76s)]
*  imagine that the system that you have and we all have across America is prepared to fight that type [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=133.92s)]
*  of battle. You're right. Our resources are adequate most days for the normal 911 emergencies and the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=141.92s)]
*  occasional structure fires and bushfires. An event like what we're seeing here, both on the Palisades [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=152.16s)]
*  and the Eaton fire, two major fires in LA County is a major drawdown. None of us have enough [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=157.51999999999998s)]
*  resources, which is why you're seeing thousands of firefighters coming in from all over the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=163.68s)]
*  western United States to help us. So Chief, can you walk us through how to prepare for a day like [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=169.6s)]
*  today when the winds are forecasted to really pick up? We know that's a danger. We know that adds to [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=174.64000000000001s)]
*  the unpredictability of these blazes. How does a department like yours try to get ready for that? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=180.72s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great question. And so we talk a lot about preparedness here in Southern California [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=187.60000000000002s)]
*  both on the wildfire side, the earthquake side, and it's all the tips that we've talked about for [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  our residents about being prepared. And then on the fire line, we have over 3,400 firefighters [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=199.44s)]
*  attacking this fire. Last night the wind started kicking up. The fire line's held and the crews [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=207.51999999999998s)]
*  did an amazing job keeping those fire lines intact. We will continue to deploy firefighters today. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=213.2s)]
*  Over the next 36 plus hours, maybe even 48 hours, those winds are going to continue to [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=219.6s)]
*  increase and be erratic. But we have a lot of resources here in order to protect our community. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=224.23999999999998s)]
*  Chief, yesterday there was a press release about drinking water in Pasadena area. Could you tell me [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=231.6s)]
*  what is the situation with drinking water? Is there water access? Have lines been harmed? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=240.56s)]
*  How long will it take to get safe water up and running again? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=246.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great question. And so I think it's important to give context that [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=251.92s)]
*  the Eden Fire crosses multiple cities and jurisdictions. Pasadena being a full service [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=257.76s)]
*  city, we have our own water and power department. And so Pasadena Water has been testing the water [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=265.04s)]
*  in the impacted areas. We believe that over 90% of the people that were on a do not drink tap water [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=271.44s)]
*  order in those impacted areas, if the tests return back favorable today, we'll be able to start [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=279.6s)]
*  drinking tap water, which is really good. Again, there's multiple water jurisdictions across [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=285.84s)]
*  the Eden Fire impacted area. So I would encourage residents to really defer to their jurisdiction. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=291.92s)]
*  But on the Pasadena side, our recovery on the water side is coming rapidly. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=299.04s)]
*  Chief, we want to end by just saying we're so grateful for the work that you're doing. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=304.72s)]
*  So many first responders are doing. Let me just ask you before you go, because millions of Americans [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=309.44s)]
*  are watching the battle you're fighting and that your brothers and sisters on the front lines are [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=315.04s)]
*  fighting. And they want to know how they can help. What do you say to Americans? What do you need [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=321.76s)]
*  right now? Yeah. If you allow me to, for most of my career, we've talked about assisting other [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=327.68s)]
*  agencies in their time of need, up and down the state. But never did I think that it would actually [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=336.56s)]
*  be my community needing assistance. And this is personal. Many of my city employees have lost homes, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=342.16s)]
*  have loved ones that have lost homes, yet they're still here in service to our community. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=350.16s)]
*  So first and foremost, if you're asking what we need, lots of thoughts and prayers. We need, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=354.8s)]
*  we also need rain, if you can say some prayers for rain. And then go to your standard areas for [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=359.52000000000004s)]
*  donation. Red Cross, United Way, areas that you know are vetted and appropriate. But we have a [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=366.16s)]
*  lot of local resources coming in right now to help us with donations on those impacted families. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=373.28000000000003s)]
*  But that's my current recommendations. All right. Pasadena Fire Chief Chad Augustine, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=379.2s)]
*  know that you're in my family's prayers and so many Americans' prayers. And we're keeping in [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=385.52s)]
*  our thoughts for not only you, but also your friends and loved ones who have lost homes, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=392.32s)]
*  as well as those on the force, those on the front lines that don't even have a home to go to tonight [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=398.15999999999997s)]
*  after they finish saving other people's homes. Thank you and God bless you. We appreciate you [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=404.72s)]
*  being with us. Thank you very much. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGzOEOFl_DM&t=410.24s)]
