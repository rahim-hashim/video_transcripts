# Open antisemitism in the U.S. has become 'more profound' since Oct. 7 attacks: Bari Weiss
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw)
*  That attack in Colorado comes less than two weeks after an assassination in Washington, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=0.0s)]
*  D.C. that killed two employees of the Israeli embassy. Authorities say the suspects in both [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=5.04s)]
*  cases expressed anti-Israel and pro-Palestinian ideologies during or after their attacks. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=10.96s)]
*  Anti-Semitic hate crimes in the U.S. are, as we told you yesterday, as a whole on the rise [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=18.16s)]
*  since October 7th, since those Hamas terrorist attacks and the ensuing war. With us now the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=24.0s)]
*  editor of Free Press, Barry Weiss. I've been talking about anti-Semitism now for 20 years on, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=30.96s)]
*  you know, Morning Joe in Scarborough country. We talk about it on college campuses 20 years ago [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=40.879999999999995s)]
*  and also across Europe. This feels different. This really does feel different to me, and I [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  know it does to you too. Explain why. I think the reason it feels different, Joe, is if we think back [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=53.6s)]
*  five, six years ago to the massacre that happened at the synagogue where I became a bat mitzvah, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=59.84s)]
*  tree of life in Pittsburgh, where 11 Jews were massacred, there were two key differences. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  The first one is that the person that was radicalized seemed mentally deranged, and so [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=70.48s)]
*  that was the first thing. The second thing is that there was universal condemnation and outrage [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=77.44s)]
*  surrounding culture. It was front page news. No one had any trouble condemning it. No one had any [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=83.52s)]
*  trouble calling it for what it was, which was absolutely evil. So fast forward to these two [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=89.36s)]
*  recent attacks. The perpetrator in the case of the DC rampage, the murder of Yaron Lashinsky and Sarah [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=95.36s)]
*  Milgram, two names that should be known to everyone in this country, but you will see no celebrities [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=102.32s)]
*  making videos, making sure that we know and say their names. He was extraordinarily articulate. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=107.28s)]
*  He was evil when you read his manifesto, but it was an incredibly coherent, if not morally upside [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=114.08s)]
*  down worldview. So that's the first thing. He was radicalized by a movement that has created a [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=120.56s)]
*  permission structure for violence and the hunting of publicly recognized Jews in this country. The [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  second thing is the unbelievable silence of the surrounding culture. And if not silence, open [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=133.68s)]
*  glorification on the part of some leftist groups that are celebrating this attack. That is the core [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=140.48000000000002s)]
*  difference that we've seen over the span of those five or six years. And I think one of the things [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=147.84s)]
*  that's been so alarming to watch in this country is that since October 7th, the open antisemitism [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=152.32s)]
*  in this country has become more profound, not less. And I think it's profoundly unfortunate [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=160.88s)]
*  that people do not understand the history and do not understand that what begins with Jews does not [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=169.51999999999998s)]
*  end with Jews. Fundamentally, what this is about is an attack on the rule of law, attack on the idea [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=176.4s)]
*  that individuals, minorities in this country should be safe, and fundamentally an attack on the West [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=183.6s)]
*  and on America itself. What starts with the Jews doesn't end with the Jews. And the lesson of [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=190.32s)]
*  history, unfortunately, is people often don't realize that until it's too late. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=195.52s)]
*  Samari, there is a new article in the Free Press, your publication, by Jeffrey Herff about the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=199.52s)]
*  recent attacks in Washington, D.C. and Colorado. It's titled Free Palestine Terrorism. And in it, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=203.76s)]
*  Jeffrey writes in part this. They are terrorist attacks carried out against Jews in America [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=212.16s)]
*  in the name of liberation thousands of miles away. They were carried out by people who feel [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=217.36s)]
*  so emboldened by the global ideological assault on Israel and its supporters that they were willing [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=222.48000000000002s)]
*  to make the leap from hatred to violence. And if history is a guide, they will not be the last to [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=228.0s)]
*  do so. It is likely, indeed probable, that these two attacks excite and stimulate others to further [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=233.12s)]
*  acts of violence. After all, the response on many campuses to the Hamas massacres of October 7th [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=240.24s)]
*  range from enthusiasm to apologia. Calls to end Israel's existence from the river to the sea [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=248.0s)]
*  increased and pro-Palestinian demonstrations and antagonism towards Zionists exploded at universities [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=253.68s)]
*  and colleges all over the United States. And that's sort of the tricky balance here, right, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=261.28000000000003s)]
*  is that of course people can be angry at what they see in Gaza. They can be upset with how [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=266.4s)]
*  the Israeli government is conducting that war. But there's no excuse ever for the violence and [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=272.15999999999997s)]
*  hatred, the anti-Semitic violence hatreds that we've seen too often come with. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=279.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I would say a few things to that. Imagine if this was any other minority group that had [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=283.28s)]
*  just been attacked with Molotov cocktails and flamethrowers for being a member of that minority [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=288.08s)]
*  group. It would be the headline story everywhere around the world. It would be going viral on [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=292.96s)]
*  social media. As to the question of Israeli government policy, look, these people are being [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=298.0s)]
*  targeted for one simple reason. It is because they are Jewish, plain and simple. These are [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=302.56s)]
*  American citizens, many of them, who are being attacked because they are Jewish. And I think [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=307.68s)]
*  it's extraordinarily important to think about some of the slogans that this pro-Palestine [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=311.35999999999996s)]
*  movement has been shouting. Globalize the Intifada. What does that mean? It is not a metaphor. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=317.36s)]
*  It means open season on Jews worldwide. That is what it means. And I think it's also important [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=324.16s)]
*  to interrogate what free Palestine means. There are some people that shout that slogan. It means [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=329.92s)]
*  something extraordinarily well-intentioned. They mean, I don't want to see innocent people dying [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=334.56s)]
*  in a war, or I believe in Palestinian sovereignty in a territory like the West Bank. But there are [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=338.8s)]
*  other people that shout, from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free. And what they mean [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=345.76s)]
*  is the elimination of the Jewish state of Israel. And I think it's extraordinarily important to [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=351.03999999999996s)]
*  really look at these slogans and take these people seriously and literally. And I unfortunately don't [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=356.56s)]
*  think people have been doing enough of that. And look where we are now. Take them seriously, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=364.71999999999997s)]
*  and take them literally. And last year, if you talk to Jewish students or you talk to [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=370.56s)]
*  Jewish parents with children at colleges, I remember days where they would call their children [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=380.24s)]
*  and say, stay inside. You are not safe going outside. And I heard it from too many people. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=386.16s)]
*  It's frightening. And Barry, you know, I've always been seen as a big supporter of Israel. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=395.35999999999996s)]
*  People joked when I was in Congress that I should be given the keys to Tel Aviv. But I've been [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=403.35999999999996s)]
*  harshly critical of Netanyahu over the past year, a year and a half along the way, with some of the [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=408.96s)]
*  things that have happened, what's happening on the West Bank, what continues to happen in Gaza. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=415.2s)]
*  But let's be clear here. This is not about policy differences. What we are hearing from extremists [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=420.40000000000003s)]
*  is about the right for Israel to exist, the right for Israel to exist, whether it is Netanyahu [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=428.16s)]
*  or a moderate prime minister, whomever it is, this has been going on for years. And to further [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=437.76000000000005s)]
*  bring that into sharp relief here, nobody was talking about West Bank policy when these Jews [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=446.15999999999997s)]
*  were set on fire. They were simply remembering the hostages that Hamas took a year and a half ago. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=455.12s)]
*  I mean, if that inspires hate of Jews, my God, it's insanity. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=465.36s)]
*  Just to draw out the absurdity of the idea that this has anything to do with Israeli government [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=474.48s)]
*  policy, imagine if Americans somewhere else in the world were assaulted, hunted down because Trump [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=480.32s)]
*  is our president right now. What would the reaction be to that? Imagine if someone made that argument [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=488.96000000000004s)]
*  to us. We would be appalled by that. Barry, take it to the next level. They're not even talking [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=494.56s)]
*  about, this isn't even about Netanyahu here, the protests were over hostages. Imagine that Americans [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=502.24s)]
*  were being held hostage somewhere across the world and people were going out to remember the [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=509.52s)]
*  Americans that were still being held hostage and then they were set on fire. How would the world [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=516.24s)]
*  respond to that, Barry? It's extraordinary. I mean, the response would be, it's self-evident, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=521.76s)]
*  right? It's absolutely self-evident and people need to ask themselves why there is an exception [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=530.3199999999999s)]
*  when it comes to the Jewish community. Why is there not outrage on the part of everyone that has [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=537.04s)]
*  hashtag campaigns and social media influencers? You know, it's blanketed for every other cause, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=543.92s)]
*  but this one. Editor of the Free Press, Barry Weiss, thank you very much. Thank you Barry. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=551.36s)]
*  Thank you for coming on the show. Thanks for having me. We appreciate it. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOEaOejjJw&t=558.24s)]
