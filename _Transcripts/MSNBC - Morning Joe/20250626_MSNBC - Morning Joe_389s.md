# 'Severely damaged': CIA contradicts initial assessment from Defense Intelligence Agency
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM)
*  Now turn to our top story, which is the situation with Iran. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=0.0s)]
*  The CIA says its intelligence indicates that America's strikes did severely damage Iran's [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=4.28s)]
*  nuclear program. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=9.52s)]
*  In a statement, Director John Ratcliffe explains a body of credible intelligence from a historically [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=10.52s)]
*  reliable and accurate source indicates, quote, several key Iranian nuclear facilities were [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=16.56s)]
*  destroyed and would have to be rebuilt over the course of years. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  This contradicts a leaked initial assessment from the Defense Intelligence Agency, which [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=27.48s)]
*  found that the bombings only set back Iran's program by several months. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=33.08s)]
*  Three sources with knowledge of the matter tell NBC News that the agency also labeled [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=37.84s)]
*  its report as being low confidence. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=42.58s)]
*  They categorize these things. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=45.28s)]
*  It comes as the president and his administration have been outright dismissing the assessment, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=47.0s)]
*  angrily doing so, calling it inconclusive and premature. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  Yesterday, during the NATO summit at The Hague, President Trump doubled down on his claim [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=56.36s)]
*  that America's bombs simply obliterated Tehran's nuclear capabilities. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=62.519999999999996s)]
*  As you know, last weekend, the United States successfully carried out a massive precision [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=68.88s)]
*  strike on Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities, and it was very, very successful. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=74.6s)]
*  It was called obliteration. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=82.48s)]
*  No other military on earth could have done it, and now this incredible exercise of American [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=85.2s)]
*  strength has paved the way for peace. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=90.60000000000001s)]
*  The devastating U.S. strike on Fordow destroyed the site's critical infrastructure and rendered [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=93.16s)]
*  the enrichment facility totally inoperable. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  It was devastated. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=102.12s)]
*  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is set to hold a news conference on America's strikes in [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  Iran later this morning. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=109.60000000000001s)]
*  And Cady, it has been vociferous objections from the administration the last 24 hours [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=111.16s)]
*  or so about that assessment from DIA with a lot of attacks on the news media, you know, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=116.11999999999999s)]
*  unfounded claims of bias or deep state conspiracy. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=124.72s)]
*  The short answer is they're still assessing what's going on. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=128.44s)]
*  We'll probably learn more later today. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=132.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they're painting that press conference with Secretary Hegseth later this morning [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=134.12s)]
*  as a kind of defense of the pilots. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=137.51999999999998s)]
*  Nobody is criticizing the pilots. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=139.24s)]
*  They did an extraordinary job. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=140.96s)]
*  Meanwhile, a classified Senate briefing regarding last weekend's airstrikes in Iran is set for [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=142.6s)]
*  today after it was postponed earlier this week. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=147.44s)]
*  Two sources tell NBC News the White House is expected to send both Secretary of State [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=150.36s)]
*  Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, also General [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=154.68s)]
*  Dan Cain, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to brief senators. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=161.24s)]
*  Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, however, will not attend. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=165.88s)]
*  A classified briefing for members of the House of Representatives is also set for tomorrow. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=169.51999999999998s)]
*  Throughout the NATO summit, President Trump repeatedly said the U.S. strikes on Iran ended [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=175.28s)]
*  the war, but he also conceded that the fighting between Israel and Iran could start up again. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=179.83999999999997s)]
*  I dealt with both, and they're both tired, exhausted. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=185.83999999999997s)]
*  They fought very, very hard and very viciously, very violently, and they were both satisfied [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=191.35999999999999s)]
*  to go home and get out. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=197.64s)]
*  And can it start again? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=200.4s)]
*  I guess someday it can. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=201.68s)]
*  It could maybe start soon. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=203.07999999999998s)]
*  I think a big telltale sign was when, as you know, Iran somewhat, by not much, violated [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=205.48s)]
*  the ceasefire, and Israel had the planes going out that morning, and there were a lot of [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=213.72s)]
*  them, 52 of them. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=219.32s)]
*  And I said, you got to get them back. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=221.51999999999998s)]
*  And they brought them back. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=223.07999999999998s)]
*  They didn't do anything. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  They brought them back. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=225.07999999999998s)]
*  It was very good. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  We're going to talk to them next week with Iran. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=228.08s)]
*  We may sign an agreement. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=233.20000000000002s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=234.56s)]
*  To me, I don't think it's that necessary. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=235.56s)]
*  I mean, they had a war. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=236.84s)]
*  They fought. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=238.24s)]
*  Now they're going back to their world. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=239.24s)]
*  I don't care if I have an agreement or not. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=240.24s)]
*  The only thing we'd be asking for is what we were asking for before about we want no [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=243.04000000000002s)]
*  nuclear, but we destroyed the nuclear. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=247.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=250.84s)]
*  Richard, can you pass that last comment for me? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=251.84s)]
*  If the president says there's really no need for any kind of diplomatic negotiations now, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=254.76s)]
*  no need for an agreement with Iran because we have destroyed their nuclear capabilities, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=258.96s)]
*  but that is still actually under review. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=263.8s)]
*  We don't have the final data on that. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=265.92s)]
*  What do you make of what he just said? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=267.56s)]
*  Well, two things. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=269.15999999999997s)]
*  First, on the destruction thing, there's obviously debate between the CIA and the DIA over what [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=270.15999999999997s)]
*  the damage was. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=275.48s)]
*  That's, by the way, pretty traditional. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=276.48s)]
*  Bomb damage assessment is much more art than science. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=278.2s)]
*  The Iranians are obviously not going to allow people to get a good look. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=281.59999999999997s)]
*  I actually think the bigger issue, Cady, is what amount of enriched uranium, number of [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=284.4s)]
*  centrifuges were not housed in those three facilities, which obviously then survived [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=289.84s)]
*  the strikes. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=295.0s)]
*  So one has to assume that Iran has elements of a nuclear program that could be reconstituted [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=296.0s)]
*  if and when they chose. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=301.4s)]
*  I think what the president's alluding to, some people are saying, well, now we have [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=302.91999999999996s)]
*  to have a new agreement with the Iranians. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=306.15999999999997s)]
*  Diplomatically that would arrange for inspections, place severe limits, maybe 100 percent limits [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=309.44s)]
*  on their nuclear program. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=313.76000000000005s)]
*  I'm not sure that can be negotiated with the Iranian government. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=315.12s)]
*  And I actually think we're facing a future where probably we either don't have a formal [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=319.72s)]
*  agreement on what Iran does in the nuclear realm, or even if we do have it, the Iranians [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=323.6s)]
*  will look for ways to work around it or not comply with it. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=328.52000000000004s)]
*  Because my sense is that a lot of people in that country are going to come to the conclusion [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=331.40000000000003s)]
*  that the reason Israel and the United States attacked them the way they did is because [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=336.04s)]
*  Iran did not possess nuclear weapons. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=340.04s)]
*  So I actually think there'll be a big push, not over the next couple of days, but over [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=342.52000000000004s)]
*  months and years to come, for Iran to secretly try to reconstitute its nuclear program. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=346.28000000000003s)]
*  So I don't think whatever else happened the last couple of weeks, it didn't solve this [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=352.04s)]
*  problem. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=355.52000000000004s)]
*  This problem is going to be with us down the road. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=356.52000000000004s)]
*  That idea of having the weapons as a deterrent, sort of the North Korea model, perhaps Iran [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=358.04s)]
*  will follow. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJdCPV0USXM&t=362.36s)]
