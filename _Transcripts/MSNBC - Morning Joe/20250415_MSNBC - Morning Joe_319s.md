# Morning Joe debates Trump's Harvard crackdown: Free speech or authoritarianism?
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo)
*  So the Trump administration froze more than $2 billion in grants for Harvard University [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=0.0s)]
*  after the school refused to comply with the White House's requirements. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=6.0s)]
*  The Trump administration demanded the university eliminate its DEI programs and screen international [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=10.76s)]
*  students for ideological concerns. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=17.7s)]
*  Yesterday, Harvard pushed back, calling the request illegal. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=20.6s)]
*  In a statement, the university's president wrote, quote, no government, regardless of [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=26.7s)]
*  which party is in power, should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=31.16s)]
*  can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=37.14s)]
*  Harvard is now the first school to flatly reject the White House's demands, though [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=43.379999999999995s)]
*  other universities are pushing back. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=48.78s)]
*  Last week, the White House announced it will halt federal funding for Cornell and Northwestern [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=51.620000000000005s)]
*  while the administration investigates alleged civil rights violations. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=56.34s)]
*  Meanwhile, Columbia University had its funding restored last month after it agreed to a series [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=62.06s)]
*  of changes set by the White House. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=69.54s)]
*  Chris Matthews, your thoughts on Harvard's decision not to cave? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=73.66s)]
*  Well, I have to say that the administration sometimes sets its targets in the right direction. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=80.34s)]
*  The elite universities in this country are not exactly covered in roses right now in [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=86.16s)]
*  the way that they handle these demonstrations. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=90.44s)]
*  I think everybody, whether you're a Jewish student or not, I think you want to have a [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=92.6s)]
*  right to go to a class when you're paying $90,000 a year in tuition. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=96.47999999999999s)]
*  You have a right to go to the class and be taught by your professors and to enjoy the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=100.24s)]
*  rights of a better university, a good university. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=104.6s)]
*  And the fact that they had to be told to do this, they had to be told to let students [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=107.42s)]
*  school, which is what this is about. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=112.24s)]
*  They had to be told to do that. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=115.24s)]
*  They had a problem in their own heads. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=116.44s)]
*  So I think the elite universities are taking a beating right now. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=118.41999999999999s)]
*  It's probably a smart move. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=121.39999999999999s)]
*  It may not be nice, but it's one of those areas where people are rooting for this guy, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=123.1s)]
*  Garcia, because they think he might be an innocent man being thrown into a prison in [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=127.56s)]
*  a foreign country. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=131.64s)]
*  But the fact is, in this case, it's Trump going after the elites. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=132.64s)]
*  He knows what he's doing. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=136.62s)]
*  Politically, it's not going to hurt him. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=137.95999999999998s)]
*  I think these universities have enough money to cover their legacies. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=139.74s)]
*  They got a lot of money to handle it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=145.78s)]
*  So they're going to be able to take care of themselves. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=147.46s)]
*  I don't want to be loose about this. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=148.94s)]
*  But I think Trump targeting these universities is probably not the worst movie ever made. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=150.42000000000002s)]
*  I'm going to respectfully push back on this. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=156.14000000000001s)]
*  I totally disagree. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=159.14000000000001s)]
*  This is thought policing 101. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=161.42000000000002s)]
*  This is not OK. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=163.66000000000003s)]
*  And I say this as a Jew. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=165.78s)]
*  This is not. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=169.01999999999998s)]
*  They are using anti-Semitism as a cloak. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=170.01999999999998s)]
*  If this administration really cared about anti-Semitism, there's a lot of stuff they [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=174.1s)]
*  could do. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=177.29999999999998s)]
*  This is not about that. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=178.29999999999998s)]
*  This is about targeting universities. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=179.39999999999998s)]
*  This is about targeting speech. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=181.38s)]
*  This is right out of an authoritarian playbook. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=183.5s)]
*  And this is—and, you know, they may say that it's one thing, but what I've been really [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=186.57999999999998s)]
*  impressed with is that we're seeing a lot of universities push back because they know [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=191.33999999999997s)]
*  this is illegal. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=195.22s)]
*  So we have—right after Harvard did it, we saw MIT go right after that. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=196.85999999999999s)]
*  We had already seen the president of Wesleyan, Michael Roth, do a really great job of pushing [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=201.29999999999998s)]
*  back. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=206.38s)]
*  He was joined by the president of Amherst. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=207.38s)]
*  There are huge numbers of academics and academic institutions that are going to push back on [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=209.26s)]
*  this because this is absolute government overreach at the highest order. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=214.29999999999998s)]
*  It has nothing to do with anti-Semitism and everything to do with authoritarianism. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=218.57999999999998s)]
*  Former President Obama praised Harvard for their— [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=223.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=225.78s)]
*  —same points of view here. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=226.86s)]
*  This is what we do. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=227.86s)]
*  But here's what the former president said about Harvard's decision. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=228.86s)]
*  Chris, you want to take the final word? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=232.5s)]
*  I just want to say something that happened in Harrisburg the other night. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=235.38s)]
*  And I think that guy breaking in and starting a fire to kill the family of the governor [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=238.26s)]
*  of Pennsylvania was a serious act. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=243.1s)]
*  It looked like anti-Semitism. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=245.62s)]
*  It happened over a Seder weekend. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=246.62s)]
*  I think there's a real challenge. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=249.02s)]
*  I asked my friends who are Jewish, I said, are you worried? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=250.46s)]
*  And they say yes. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=252.98s)]
*  This is a problem. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=254.34s)]
*  And the treatment of those students in Columbia is a serious problem. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=255.66s)]
*  You don't stop a kid from going to school their parents paid for. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=260.06s)]
*  It's serious. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=263.18s)]
*  And it was against those students and said, you can't go to class even to take an exam. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=264.46s)]
*  Well, seriously, if you don't think that's a problem, you've got a problem yourself. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=269.46s)]
*  I'm a Jew. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=273.34000000000003s)]
*  I absolutely believe that anti-Semitism is a real and serious problem. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=274.34000000000003s)]
*  But I also think that taking over Harvard University's teaching and academia and ideology [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=278.86s)]
*  is not the answer. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=285.42s)]
*  Fair enough. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=286.42s)]
*  We'll leave it there and come back to this because this sounds like a good debate to [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=287.42s)]
*  have here. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=291.3s)]
*  Chris Matthews, thank you. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=292.3s)]
*  And you can now read his new substack, Hardball with Chris Matthews. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=293.78000000000003s)]
*  I love it. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=298.22s)]
*  Still ahead. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=299.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHxvJiRcUbo&t=315.42s)]
