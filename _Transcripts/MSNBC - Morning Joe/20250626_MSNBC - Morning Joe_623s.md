# Hegseth attacks media, touts military in Pentagon briefing on Iran strikes
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY)
*  Sure. And right now we can see Sucker Defense Hegseth, General Kaine, taking the podium live at the Pentagon. Let's listen. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=0.0s)]
*  Back from NATO, two days apart from my battle buddy, so it's good to see him this morning. Good to see you, Mr. Chairman. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=6.0s)]
*  You too, sir. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=12.0s)]
*  Where there was a historic outcome, I want to start with that real quick. I think there's so much news, so many things happening, that oftentimes big, momentous moments get missed. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=14.0s)]
*  What President Trump accomplished in NATO yesterday was game-changing and historic. A shift in burden-sharing to European responsibility in NATO that most would have said was impossible at the beginning of his term. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=25.0s)]
*  But he said NATO needs to pay up. They started in the first term, and here in his second term we've accelerated that. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=40.0s)]
*  Thirty-two NATO countries committed to spending five percent of their GDP on defense, on actually investing in the NATO alliance. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=50.0s)]
*  So I hope with all the ink spilled, all of your outlets find the time to properly recognize this historic change in continental security that other presidents tried to do, other presidents talked about. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=57.0s)]
*  President Trump accomplished it. It's a huge deal. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=72.0s)]
*  You see, we're here this morning because in hunting for scandals all the time, in trying to find wedges and spin stories, this press corps and the press corps miss historic moments. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=76.0s)]
*  You miss historic moments like five percent at NATO, which when you hear – I was in the closed-door briefing. I wish there could have been cameras in there. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=91.0s)]
*  When you heard the prime ministers and presidents of other countries, to a man and to a woman, looking at President Trump and saying, this never could have happened. Never would have happened. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=98.0s)]
*  It seemed impossible five years ago, two years ago, eight years ago. But here we are because of your leadership. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=106.0s)]
*  If you asked them the question, I bet they'd say the same thing. But searching for scandals, you miss historic moments like recruiting at the Pentagon, historic levels in the Army, the Air Force and the Navy. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=113.0s)]
*  Yeah, maybe there'll be a little mention here or there. But because it was under President Trump's leadership, because it was because Americans are responding to him as commander in chief, the press corps doesn't want to write about it. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=126.0s)]
*  Or bring us to the topic of the moment, the highly successful strikes in Iran. Let me read the bottom line here. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=138.0s)]
*  President Trump directed the most complex and secretive military operation in history. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=148.0s)]
*  And it was a resounding success, resulting in a ceasefire agreement and the end of the 12-day war. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=154.0s)]
*  There's been a lot of discussion about what happened and what didn't happen. Step back for a second. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=162.0s)]
*  Because of decisive military action, President Trump created the conditions to end the war, decimating, choose your word, obliterating, destroying Iran's nuclear capabilities. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=166.0s)]
*  I want to read some of the assessments that have been provided because whether it's fake news, CNN, MSNBC or the New York Times, there's been fawning coverage of a preliminary assessment. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=181.0s)]
*  Preliminary assessment. I've had a chance to read it. Every outlet has breathlessly reported on a preliminary assessment from DIA. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=194.0s)]
*  I'm looking at it right now. Again, it was preliminary, a day and a half after the actual strike. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=202.0s)]
*  When it admits itself in writing that it requires weeks to accumulate the necessary data to make such an assessment, it's preliminary. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=209.0s)]
*  It points out that it's not been coordinated with the intelligence community at all. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=216.0s)]
*  There's low confidence in this particular report. It says in the report, there are gaps in the information. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=221.0s)]
*  It says in the report, multiple linchpin assumptions are what this assessment, a linchpin assumption. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=226.0s)]
*  You know what that is? That means your entire premise is predicated on a linchpin. If you're wrong, everything else is wrong. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=233.0s)]
*  And yet, still, this report acknowledges it's likely severe damage. Again, this is preliminary. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=239.0s)]
*  But leaked because someone had an agenda to try to muddy the waters and make it look like this historic strike wasn't successful. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=245.0s)]
*  I'm going to get to the chairman in a moment because he's going to lay out the particulars for you based on his professional military experience. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=252.0s)]
*  But here's what other folks are saying. The DIA that put that report out says that this is a preliminary, low-confidence report [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=259.0s)]
*  and will continue to be refined as additional intelligence becomes available. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=266.0s)]
*  How about the Israeli Atomic Energy Commission? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=272.0s)]
*  The devastating U.S. strikes on Fordow destroyed the site's critical infrastructure and rendered the enrichment facility inoperable. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=275.0s)]
*  Have any of these quotes made their way into the New York Times or the Washington Post? MSNBC? CNN? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=283.0s)]
*  Any of these quotes? How about this one? This is a new one from the UN, the United Nations. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=290.0s)]
*  No friend of the United States or certainly Israel often. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=294.0s)]
*  Here's the head of the UN Atomic Energy Agency this morning, Rafael Grossi. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=298.0s)]
*  U.S. and Israeli strikes caused enormous damage to Iran's nuclear sites. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=303.0s)]
*  Don't take my word for it. How about the IDF's chief of staff? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=310.0s)]
*  I can say here that the assessment is that we significantly damaged the nuclear program, setting it back by years. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=314.0s)]
*  I repeat, years. The Iranian Foreign Minister, the spokesman, our nuclear installations have been badly damaged. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=320.0s)]
*  That's for sure. I'm sure that's an understatement. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=327.0s)]
*  John Radcliffe, the director of the CIA, putting out a statement just last night. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=331.0s)]
*  CIA can confirm that a body of credible intelligence indicates Iran's nuclear program has been severely damaged by recent targeted strikes. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=336.0s)]
*  This includes new intelligence from a historically reliable, very different than preliminary assessment, with low confidence. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=346.0s)]
*  He's saying historically reliable and accurate source and method that several key Iranian nuclear facilities were destroyed and would have to be rebuilt over the course of years. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=353.0s)]
*  CIA continues to collect additional reliably sourced information to keep appropriate decision makers fully informed. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=366.0s)]
*  How about DNI Talsey Gabbard yesterday? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=375.0s)]
*  She writes, and I quote, New intelligence confirms what POTUS has stated numerous times. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=378.0s)]
*  Iran's nuclear facilities have been destroyed. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=383.0s)]
*  Institute for Science and International Security President David Albright, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=389.0s)]
*  overall Israel and U.S. attacks have effectively destroyed UN Iran's centrifuge enrichment program. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=393.0s)]
*  Time and time again, I can go down the list. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=402.0s)]
*  Those that understand, those that see, those that do proper assessments recognize that what the United States military did was historic. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=406.0s)]
*  And again, before I pass it to the chairman, because you, and I mean specifically you, the press, specifically you, the press corps, because you cheer against Trump so hard, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=415.0s)]
*  it's like in your DNA and in your blood to cheer against Trump, because you want him not to be successful so bad, you have to cheer against the efficacy of these strikes. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=430.0s)]
*  You have to hope maybe they weren't effective. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=442.0s)]
*  Maybe the way the Trump administration has represented them isn't true. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=445.0s)]
*  So let's take half truths, spun information, leaked information, and then spin it, spin it in every way we can to try to cause doubt and manipulate the mind, the public mind over whether or not our brave pilots were successful. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=448.0s)]
*  How many stories have been written about how hard it is to, I don't know, fly a plane for 36 hours? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=467.0s)]
*  Has MSNBC done that story? Has Fox? Have we done the story how hard that is? Have we done it two or three times? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=473.0s)]
*  So that American people understand how about how difficult it is to shoot a drone from an F-15 or 16 or F-22 or F-35? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=480.0s)]
*  Or what it's like to man a Patriot battery? Or how hard it is to refuel midair, giving the American people an understanding of how complex and sophisticated this mission really was. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=487.0s)]
*  There are so many aspects of what our brave men and women did that because of the hatred of this press corps are undermined because people are trying to leak and spin that it wasn't successful. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=496.0s)]
*  It's irresponsible. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=509.0s)]
*  And folks in this room are privy to that information because of the proximity here in the Pentagon. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=511.0s)]
*  It's an important responsibility. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=517.0s)]
*  It's an important responsibility. And time and time again, classified information is leaked or peddled for political purposes to try to make the president look bad. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=519.0s)]
*  And what's really happening is you're undermining the success of incredible B-2 pilots and incredible F-35 pilots and incredible refuelers and incredible air defenders who accomplished their mission, set back a nuclear program in ways that other presidents would have dreamed. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=528.0s)]
*  How about we celebrate that? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=544.0s)]
*  How about we talk about how special America is, that only we have these capabilities? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=546.0s)]
*  I think it's too much to ask, unfortunately, for the fake news. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=551.0s)]
*  So we're used to that. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=554.0s)]
*  But we also have an opportunity to stand at the podium and read the truth of what's really happening. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=556.0s)]
*  And the reality is you want to call it destroyed, you want to call it defeated, you want to call it obliterated. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=561.0s)]
*  Choose your word. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=566.0s)]
*  This was an historically successful attack. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=569.0s)]
*  We should celebrate it as Americans. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=571.0s)]
*  And it gives us a chance to have peace, a chance to have a deal, and an opportunity to prevent a nuclear Iran, which is something President Trump talked about for 20 years and no other presidents had the courage to actually do. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=573.0s)]
*  So with that, I want to hand it over to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=585.0s)]
*  They've done technical analysis on this, not just on the strike, but also on our patriot defenders on Al Udeid. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=588.0s)]
*  And Mr. Chairman, I'll hand it over to you. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=595.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxX22JMOhnY&t=598.0s)]
