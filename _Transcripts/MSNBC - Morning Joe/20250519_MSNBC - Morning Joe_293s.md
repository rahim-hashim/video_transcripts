# 'Eat the tariffs': Trump says he and Walmart customers will be watching store prices
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY)
*  While the president is also facing off with Walmart, after the country's largest retailer [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=0.0s)]
*  warned last week it would have to raise prices because of Trump's tariffs. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=5.04s)]
*  Trump took to social media writing in part this, Walmart should stop trying to blame [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=9.92s)]
*  tariffs as the reason for raising prices. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  And then between the company and China, they should, as is said, eat the tariffs and not [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=17.36s)]
*  charge valued customers anything. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=23.88s)]
*  In that same Meet the Press interview, Secretary Bessent said he spoke with the CEO of Walmart [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=26.94s)]
*  and that the company will indeed eat some of those tariffs. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=30.66s)]
*  So for more, let's bring in the co-anchor of CNBC's Squawk Box and of course, The New [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=35.06s)]
*  York Times columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=39.78s)]
*  Andrew, good to see you this morning. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=42.34s)]
*  Let's talk about these tariffs because it wasn't that long ago where President Trump [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=44.78s)]
*  was talking about how this was sort of going to be an economic panacea. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=49.260000000000005s)]
*  This was going to bring in money for this nation and no one would feel any ill effects. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=52.82s)]
*  Here he is flat out saying that prices could rise but suggesting that it should be Walmart [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=58.300000000000004s)]
*  who eats it rather than your average American. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=64.8s)]
*  Look, it's a tax. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=67.58s)]
*  It's a tax on the American people. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=69.3s)]
*  I don't even know how many more times we need to say that part of it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=71.14s)]
*  I think the bigger question now is just what kind of political pressure there is going [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=74.46000000000001s)]
*  to be on businesses to eat some of those costs and what kind of political pressure [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=78.38s)]
*  there will otherwise be if they don't. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=84.33999999999999s)]
*  You know, it's interesting to see this White House, a Republican White House go after businesses [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=88.1s)]
*  in this way. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=93.72s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal, by the way, in their editorial page this morning saying he goes [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=94.72s)]
*  — this is he as in Donald Trump — he goes full Kamala Harris in demanding that the retail [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=98.34s)]
*  giant not raise prices. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=103.16s)]
*  It's something, frankly, that we have seen from Democrats over the years, especially [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=104.62s)]
*  during the pandemic and other times where they have effectively said that corporations [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=108.46000000000001s)]
*  were trying to gouge customers and trying to use their leverage to do that. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=114.14s)]
*  The interesting part here is — and we saw, by the way, with the Trump administration [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=119.18s)]
*  just two weeks ago as it related to Amazon when there was some floating, frankly, misinformation [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=122.22s)]
*  about Amazon potentially being transparent about if prices went up, what kind of the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=127.18s)]
*  raise would be described as effectively a tariff raise. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=133.22s)]
*  And if Trump effectively comes after a Walmart, comes after an Amazon and actually starts [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=138.14s)]
*  to tell his followers, if you will, don't shop there, shop here, shop there, that's, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=143.38s)]
*  I think, where this could get a lot more complicated for a lot of these business leaders. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=149.94s)]
*  Andrew, the political sort of macro view of this, I want to turn to the Wall Street Journal's [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=154.57999999999998s)]
*  editorial board, which points out something that I think might be obvious to anybody who [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=160.22s)]
*  knows what a fundamental definition of traditional Marxism, traditional communism, socialism [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=164.74s)]
*  might be, which is that the president of the United States is using the executive branch [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=170.70000000000002s)]
*  to tell companies how to run their businesses. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=175.54s)]
*  Politically speaking, is this just a level of numbness that people just expect now, this [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=180.86s)]
*  walking, talking contradiction or is there something deeper here in what the Wall Street [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=186.5s)]
*  Journal is pointing out? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=189.98s)]
*  I don't know if it's deeper. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=190.98s)]
*  I think what's most interesting is that it's coming from the Republican side of the political [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=192.22s)]
*  world insofar as it is very true that, you know, President Biden in the past, President [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=197.58s)]
*  Obama, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, you can name the folks on the left who historically [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=202.58s)]
*  have taken businesses to task over pricing. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=208.98000000000002s)]
*  And that's not a new phenomenon. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=213.22s)]
*  Especially though, when they did it, they didn't always name names this way. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=216.1s)]
*  They often talked about some of these companies as sort of broader context, I think by really [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=220.02s)]
*  taking aim directly at a Walmart. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=224.06s)]
*  By the way, just last week, he took aim, the President Trump took aim at Tim Cook at Apple [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=226.18s)]
*  for manufacturing or potentially manufacturing things in India. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=231.82s)]
*  So I think that's where this gets super complicated because he does have a rabid following and [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=235.7s)]
*  he can turn that rabid following for or against a particular business. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=242.34s)]
*  You can go back and think about what happened to Target after some of the LGBT sales items [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=246.66000000000003s)]
*  that they had for sale and just sort of how quickly the political world turned or the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=253.02s)]
*  Republican world in particular turned against Target. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=258.58000000000004s)]
*  Same thing happened with Budweiser. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=260.98s)]
*  And so when you have a powerful voice out there that's coming from the White House talking [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=262.46000000000004s)]
*  either positively or negatively about a specific company, boy, that that is new. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=266.62s)]
*  That is new. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-Cd2uoRhY&t=271.26s)]
