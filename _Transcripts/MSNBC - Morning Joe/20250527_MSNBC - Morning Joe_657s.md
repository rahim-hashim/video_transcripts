# 'Emotional overload': Russia hits back at Trump day after he says Putin has gone 'crazy'
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU)
*  Russia continued to launch missiles and drones throughout Ukraine yesterday, marking the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=0.0s)]
*  third day in a row of intense bombardment targeting civilian areas. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=5.08s)]
*  Ukraine's military reported another round of more than 350 drones and missiles launched [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=10.84s)]
*  throughout the country. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=16.72s)]
*  In the past week, Ukraine says, Russia has launched north of 1,300 drones and almost [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=18.04s)]
*  100 missiles. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=24.72s)]
*  Nearly 30 civilians have been killed and more than 150 people have been injured. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=26.4s)]
*  And amid Russia's intensifying attacks on Ukraine, the Kremlin is pushing back at President [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=33.72s)]
*  Trump's recent criticism of Vladimir Putin, suggesting Trump is suffering from, quote, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=39.36s)]
*  emotional overload. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=46.76s)]
*  That comes after Trump on Sunday said Putin had gone, quote, absolutely crazy. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  Speaking to reporters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov thanked President Trump for [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=54.16s)]
*  starting the negotiation process to end the war while also suggesting the president was [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=59.559999999999995s)]
*  emotional over the issue. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=65.16s)]
*  Peskov then went on to claim Russia's intense bombing campaign over the past three days [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=67.24s)]
*  was retaliatory in nature. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=73.47999999999999s)]
*  Vladimir Putin met yesterday with Turkey's foreign minister at the Kremlin. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=76.44s)]
*  It's the same Turkish official who mediated the talks in Istanbul earlier this month between [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=81.36s)]
*  Russian and Ukrainian officials. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=86.6s)]
*  Meanwhile, Germany's new chancellor said his country and Western allies, including the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=89.48s)]
*  UK, France and United States, are no longer imposing range restrictions on any weapons [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=95.0s)]
*  supplied to Ukraine. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=103.56s)]
*  Let's stop right there and talk about what that means, the range restrictions and how [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=105.72s)]
*  that will impact the fight, David, and then your analysis on this Putin-Trump situation [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=109.36s)]
*  in terms of name calling and other things. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=116.12s)]
*  So, Mika, Chancellor Merz's announcement that the range limits will be removed is significant [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=120.84s)]
*  in terms of the damage that these missiles can do to Russian cities as far away as Moscow. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=127.48s)]
*  The German Taurus missile is reportedly able to reach 300 miles, which would allow it to [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=135.56s)]
*  hit Moscow. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=142.4s)]
*  The British Storm Shadow has got a range of 155 miles. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=145.0s)]
*  The Atacom's missiles that the US supplies can go 190 miles, but there have been limits [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  on how much of that range can be used, and the Russians have simply moved their key air [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=156.84s)]
*  fields and supply depots back out of range. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=163.48s)]
*  So this is a significant step to put targets that would be valuable to Russia within range [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=166.72s)]
*  of weapons that Ukraine either has or is getting in large quantities like the German Taurus. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=173.72s)]
*  More generally, Mika, this moment right now is crunch time for Donald Trump on Ukraine [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=180.72s)]
*  and on Russia. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=189.72s)]
*  Vladimir Putin, in effect, has disrespected him directly. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=191.60000000000002s)]
*  I made a survey of all the statements that Trump has made since January, threatening [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=195.04000000000002s)]
*  sanctions, warning Putin, telling Putin if he didn't come to the table, there'd be trouble. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=201.60000000000002s)]
*  And Putin has ignored every one of them. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  He's refused the compromise proposals that Trump has suggested. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=209.60000000000002s)]
*  He's refused to cease fire. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=215.16000000000003s)]
*  So now Trump really is in the situation where he's going to have to exert some real pressure [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=217.36s)]
*  on Putin to get these negotiations back on track or visibly give up as the Russians fire [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=223.8s)]
*  their ballistic missiles and drones on Kiev, which would be a very, very unattractive, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=231.44000000000003s)]
*  I want to say humiliating situation for Trump. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=238.08s)]
*  So Richard, this is Vladimir Putin knowing what he has in Donald Trump, that Donald Trump [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=241.08s)]
*  hasn't put any real pressure on him that he can kind of act with impunity as he's begun [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=245.76s)]
*  to do now with these drone strikes and missiles shot at civilians inside of Ukraine. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=251.04s)]
*  A fascinating dynamic here between President Trump and President Putin, where you have [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=256.28s)]
*  Donald Trump saying, I don't know what the hell happened to Putin. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=260.56s)]
*  I've known this guy a long time, to which everyone in the foreign policy community says [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=263.04s)]
*  this is exactly who Vladimir Putin is and always has been. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=267.0s)]
*  The response from the Kremlin is that Donald Trump is just being emotional. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=270.32s)]
*  We've used that word a couple of times now. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=274.44s)]
*  What's going on here? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=276.64s)]
*  Donald Trump is not the first American leader to exaggerate the importance of his personal [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=278.68s)]
*  chemistry with a Soviet or Russian leader. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=283.36s)]
*  FDR did it with Stalin. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=286.04s)]
*  George W. Bush did it with Putin and so forth. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=287.92s)]
*  So he's in a long line of American leaders who have gotten this wrong and somehow think [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=290.8s)]
*  that personal chemistry or personal relationships are really critical. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=295.44s)]
*  They're never critical. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=299.56s)]
*  President Trump should have learned that not just with Putin, but with, say, the leader [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=300.68s)]
*  of North Korea or with China. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=303.76s)]
*  There's a limit to what personal things do in diplomacy. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=306.16s)]
*  What this shows is we're being played. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=310.0s)]
*  Putin's uninterested in a ceasefire. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=312.8s)]
*  He wants to continue prosecuting the war for the simple reason that he thinks he's winning, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=315.08s)]
*  even though what he's gaining is marginal. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=318.96000000000004s)]
*  The real question, by the way, is how we respond to it. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=322.96000000000004s)]
*  The option out there in the Senate is secondary sanctions. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=326.56s)]
*  Problem with those is historically, we've tried them before, and you end up having a [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=331.24s)]
*  massive friction between the United States, and in this case it would be India, Turkey, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=334.76s)]
*  and other countries, China, rather than with Russia. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=339.4s)]
*  They tend not to work as decisively as people want. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=343.2s)]
*  The real question, and this administration is not talking about it, it seems unwilling [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=346.1s)]
*  to do it, is to help Ukraine and to basically give Ukraine the arms it needs not to liberate [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=350.24s)]
*  every square inch of territory just to defend itself, to send the message to Putin that [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=356.44s)]
*  more war isn't going to do the answer. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=360.76s)]
*  One other thing that was really interesting, the report by the new chancellor of Germany [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=363.2s)]
*  talking about taking off range restrictions, the assumption in the Trump administration [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=366.96s)]
*  is that if we end harming Ukraine, that'll weaken Ukraine and this will bring the war [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=371.32s)]
*  maybe more to a close. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=376.91999999999996s)]
*  Actually just the opposite. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=378.71999999999997s)]
*  We are going to lose any leverage or influence. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=379.71999999999997s)]
*  What you're actually going to see is something of an escalation of target selection, and [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=382.76s)]
*  the war, the scale or scope of the battlefield is actually going to widen rather than shrink [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=387.56s)]
*  if the United States distance itself from Ukraine. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=393.28s)]
*  Right now the United States is still sharing intel. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=396.03999999999996s)]
*  It's not stopping sending assistance there, but there's no more money coming, new money [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=398.24s)]
*  coming. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=402.21999999999997s)]
*  As I first reported a couple of weeks ago, the Trump has a package of sanctions in front [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=403.21999999999997s)]
*  of him and he's kind of, I'm told by aides, sort of vacillating back and forth whether [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=407.28s)]
*  or not he wants to apply them. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=410.96s)]
*  To this point he has not. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=412.56s)]
*  David Ignatius, we know there's also this bipartisan bill with 80 co-sponsors, 80 plus [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=414.47999999999996s)]
*  co-sponsors at this point. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=418.64s)]
*  Lindsey Graham, obviously a close Trump ally, although not afraid to break with him occasionally [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=419.91999999999996s)]
*  on foreign policy issues. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=424.52s)]
*  He's the one who introduced it. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=425.64s)]
*  Senator Blumenthal, others quickly hopped on board. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=427.35999999999996s)]
*  Do you have any sense there for people that you talk to on the Hill, others, that there's [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=430.24s)]
*  going to be enough pressure here to push this through for the House, but also for President [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=434.2s)]
*  Trump to finally get there some sort of punishment for Putin? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=439.6s)]
*  Because as we have well chronicled, yes, once in a while Trump offers harsh words for Putin [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=443.68s)]
*  in Moscow, but there's never, ever been any follow through. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=449.84000000000003s)]
*  So it's hard for me to imagine Republicans in the Senate pushing these sanctions over [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=454.32000000000005s)]
*  the strong opposition of Trump. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=461.68s)]
*  I think it's going to go differently. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=464.8s)]
*  I think Trump, Lindsey Graham is going to go to Trump and say, Mr. President, you're [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=466.76s)]
*  being disrespected. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=471.71999999999997s)]
*  This is humiliating. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=473.15999999999997s)]
*  You need to take action. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=474.15999999999997s)]
*  And Trump will encourage this process. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=476.12s)]
*  There was reporting last night from the Wall Street Journal that elements of the Trump [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=478.71999999999997s)]
*  administration, Trump White House, were nearing that point of openly supporting sanctions [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=483.08s)]
*  themselves. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=488.15999999999997s)]
*  I do think this war is about to get, as Richard was suggesting, a lot dirtier. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=489.15999999999997s)]
*  The attacks on cities by Russia have been brutal, but there are attacks on cities now [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=495.68s)]
*  increasingly by Ukraine. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=500.72s)]
*  Ukraine has drones that are able to penetrate, get to Moscow and its environs. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=503.56s)]
*  They also have the capability to wage on the ground a dirty war of sabotage, of assassination. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=508.64s)]
*  I've met with leaders of Ukrainian military intelligence. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=514.5600000000001s)]
*  They are very, very tough, and they have networks inside Russia, as Russia has networks [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=519.04s)]
*  inside Ukraine that can do a lot of damage. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=525.48s)]
*  So as bad as this war has been, it could tip into a much nastier phase of dirty war unless [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZVUNY_RqU&t=527.7199999999999s)]
