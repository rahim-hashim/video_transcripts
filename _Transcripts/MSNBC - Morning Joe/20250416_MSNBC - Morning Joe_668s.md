# 'Public opinion is turning': Town halls get heated over Abrego Garcia's return
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY)
*  Danny, where did we begin? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=0.0s)]
*  Last time we talked, a lot has happened since the last time we talked, and this judge right [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=2.04s)]
*  now is asking for everybody to provide more details, perhaps even sit for depositions. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=8.16s)]
*  How's this going to pan out? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=15.88s)]
*  This road appears to be leading towards contempt, and in my opinion, I think contempt would [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=17.64s)]
*  have already been a stop on this road, except that I think judges, and I can't really hold [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=22.18s)]
*  this against them, but I think judges are going to be really reluctant to hold the Trump [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=27.88s)]
*  administration in contempt, because who are you going to hold in contempt? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  These lawyers are acting under orders, and we've already seen the one lawyer in the administration, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=37.04s)]
*  the government lawyer, who admitted that the government mistakenly removed Abrego Garcia, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=42.12s)]
*  he is on suspension. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=47.68s)]
*  He's essentially administratively suspended. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=49.56s)]
*  So the administration has sent a message, you tow the party line, or else you will not [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  be handling this case. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=56.76s)]
*  So the real thorny issue for any judge is if you're going to hold someone in contempt, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=58.16s)]
*  who's it going to be? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=62.72s)]
*  Because everybody in the government has a boss, except for one person in the administration, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=64.0s)]
*  and that's Donald Trump. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=69.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=70.26s)]
*  So who's in contempt here? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=71.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=72.44s)]
*  Danny, how long is it going to take for the Supreme Court, do you think, to clean up the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=73.44s)]
*  language of their order? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=76.72s)]
*  They have to have something before them, and this, I knew this was going to happen, and [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=79.44s)]
*  I'm no fortune teller. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=83.56s)]
*  I think anybody who read the Supreme Court's order knew it was problematic because it's [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=84.72s)]
*  not clear enough. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=88.84s)]
*  It just sends the case back down to the district court, which is common, by the way. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=90.48s)]
*  This happens all the time. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=94.28s)]
*  Appellate courts will say, this isn't really for us to decide. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=96.08s)]
*  We're going to send it back to the lower court, to the district court, who has a better command [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=99.0s)]
*  of the facts, and remand it with instructions, and they'll carry out the wishes of the Supreme [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=102.44s)]
*  Court or the appellate court that heard it. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=108.4s)]
*  In this case, the Trump administration has just taken the tack of saying, well, the way [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=110.84s)]
*  we read the Supreme Court's order, we're perfectly within our power to say, you cannot, court, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=114.44s)]
*  infringe on the power of the executive branch. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=121.52000000000001s)]
*  So if you ask the administration, I guarantee you, they don't think they're defying any [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=124.28s)]
*  court orders. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  They think they are complying with the court order, and they believe the Supreme Court [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  order from last week was a win for them, not a loss. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=132.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=136.4s)]
*  So a couple of things going on here at the same time. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=137.4s)]
*  First of all, Pablo, I have to just say this every time we cover the story, every hour [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=139.32s)]
*  we cover it, every time they call this one case a mistake, it is subliminally, or there's [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=143.76s)]
*  an underlying validation that all the others are completely OK. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=149.95999999999998s)]
*  They are not. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=154.85999999999999s)]
*  If you follow the law, they are not. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=156.0s)]
*  None of these people received due process, and there's reporting now that a good number [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=158.32s)]
*  of them may not have even committed a crime. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=164.48s)]
*  So we're following those parts of the story as well. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=167.4s)]
*  At the same time, Pablo, this case puts a face to it, a family to it, a heart to it, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=170.12s)]
*  a soul to it, and it seems to be breaking through. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=177.4s)]
*  Chris Matthews on this show during this hour yesterday said, people aren't going to like [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  this. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=185.76000000000002s)]
*  And I wasn't sure. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=186.76000000000002s)]
*  I was a little worried. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=187.76000000000002s)]
*  I was a little worried about the underlying subtext, subtone of racism in this country [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=188.76000000000002s)]
*  that might sort of just put these people in a different category that you don't think [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=193.48s)]
*  about, which is just unthinkable for me. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=198.35999999999999s)]
*  But I was worried. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=203.2s)]
*  I think I might have been wrong. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=204.95999999999998s)]
*  I think there's a sense that people are seeing a difference between right and wrong here, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  and they don't like it. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=213.28s)]
*  I think they're seeing that this gentleman, this undocumented man, is the face not merely [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=214.64s)]
*  of a family, but— [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=220.38s)]
*  Can I just say, undocumented men who came here to escape being tortured, to escape [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=222.6s)]
*  tyranny for a better life continue. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=227.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=229.79999999999998s)]
*  This man, given that context, they repeatedly call a terrorist. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=230.79999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  Repeatedly, just in defiance of every bit of reporting that's available. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=235.07999999999998s)]
*  The defamatory aspect of this, let's even leave that to the side. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=238.16s)]
*  What I am so encouraged by when it comes to these town hall meetings in Iowa across the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=241.16s)]
*  country is that people are also seeing him as an avatar of due process, of the rule of [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=244.95999999999998s)]
*  law itself. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=250.32s)]
*  A legal immigrant. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=251.32s)]
*  Because, to your point, the Constitution does defend undocumented people in this regard. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=252.32s)]
*  This is, I mean, again, to paraphrase Joe, I'm not even a country lawyer. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=260.59999999999997s)]
*  But it's pretty clear through the 14th Amendment. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=266.26s)]
*  If you see interviews with Antonin Scalia in the past, this is not a debate. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=268.26s)]
*  These people deserve due process, equal protection, defy freedoms, as they say. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=274.64s)]
*  What I see happening is a very familiar song being played in autocratic regimes, which [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=279.88s)]
*  is that you are too endangered and we are too strapped for resources to care about the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=285.96s)]
*  rule of law. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=293.96s)]
*  That is the argument that has been made in El Salvador by the self-appointed, self-described [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=295.59999999999997s)]
*  coolest dictator in the world. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=300.15999999999997s)]
*  And that is the echo that we are getting from our president here, too. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=302.56s)]
*  One of the things that you touched upon, the anger at the town halls from ordinary [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=307.0s)]
*  Americans suggests to me that they have a keen understanding that when you start violating [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=312.84s)]
*  due process for any human beings, even if they are not a citizen, that threatens all [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=321.76s)]
*  of us. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=328.52s)]
*  That threatens the entire system. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=329.52s)]
*  And I'm encouraged by that as well. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=332.4s)]
*  But Kilmar Garcia, I hope that Trump has miscalculated. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=335.08s)]
*  And to your point, Mika, there's some evidence that maybe he has. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=340.76s)]
*  But what concerns me even more, though, is if this is not a constitutional crisis, what [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=344.32s)]
*  does a constitutional crisis then look like? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=352.56s)]
*  And is this a test case, a trial run for the Trump administration to try and do this with [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=356.88s)]
*  a U.S. citizen, to try and defy Supreme Court orders on Social Security, on DOJ, on any [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=362.48s)]
*  manner of other issues that are at the heart of our democracy for ordinary Americans? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=369.8s)]
*  And so if the system cannot hold now for Kilmar Garcia, will it hold for the rest of us? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=377.84s)]
*  And that is the question that we should be asking. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=386.71999999999997s)]
*  Michael Tomaski, let me ask you this. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=388.92s)]
*  It seems that we're witnessing a confluence of events here with these situations. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=392.24s)]
*  And we saw what happened in Iowa at Grassley's town hall meeting. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=398.12s)]
*  And it seems at one level there's a group of people called Americans, American citizens, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=403.36s)]
*  who are witnessing what some of them, maybe more than we think, are witnessing a combination [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=410.52000000000004s)]
*  of incompetence and inequity coming from Washington, D.C. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=416.94s)]
*  Incompetence in terms of the policy on tariffs, incompetence on who gets jailed and who gets [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=423.64s)]
*  scooped out of school and taken away to places that we don't know about. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=428.88s)]
*  And inequity in terms of most Americans think, you know, I know the difference between fair [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=434.2s)]
*  and unfair. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=440.76s)]
*  And this seems to be unfair to them. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=442.48s)]
*  What's your view? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=444.52s)]
*  I agree 100 percent. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=446.88s)]
*  I'll throw the word lawlessness in there as well, Mike. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=448.6s)]
*  I could probably, we could both probably throw it another half dozen adjectives. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=451.56s)]
*  But I think it's important to add lawlessness, complete contempt for constitutional procedures [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=455.14s)]
*  and traditions and for the law. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=460.97999999999996s)]
*  I agree with what Mika said and what apparently Chris said, Matthew said yesterday, that I [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=464.5s)]
*  do think public opinion is turning around on this question as people watch this more [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=469.09999999999997s)]
*  and more. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=474.3s)]
*  As people hear, day after day, different administration officials impugn this man, Mr. Obrego Garcia, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=475.3s)]
*  without offering any evidence, without saying anything about, you know, why they make these [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=482.86s)]
*  claims about his character and his past. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=489.36s)]
*  You know, he was stopped in 2019 in Prince George's County. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=492.34000000000003s)]
*  He was not charged with anything. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=498.1s)]
*  He was turned over to ICE because he was an undocumented person, but he was released because [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=500.78000000000003s)]
*  there was no evidence that he was involved with anything. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=505.74s)]
*  So you know, people are seeing this and there's always going to be this core MAGA base, 30-something [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=509.38s)]
*  percent, that's going to believe anything Trump and his people say and is going to say, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=515.7s)]
*  ah, he's undocumented, who cares? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=520.1s)]
*  But that's a minority of this country. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=522.46s)]
*  It really is. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=524.34s)]
*  The majority cares about the idea that a man like this has due process rights under the [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=525.78s)]
*  United States Constitution. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=531.5s)]
*  I think everyone's kind of following this one so closely, Danny. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=532.5s)]
*  So what's next? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=536.34s)]
*  And also, what about the other cases that again are being kind of shoved to the side [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=537.38s)]
*  as like they're not a mistake when they are very clearly legal breaches? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=542.7800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, currently, I mean, there was an order by a district judge preventing these removals. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=547.7s)]
*  But they continue. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=553.5400000000001s)]
*  Pardon? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=554.5400000000001s)]
*  They continue these flights, don't they? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=555.5400000000001s)]
*  Absolutely, yes they do. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=557.3000000000001s)]
*  And the other thing, we talk a lot about due process, and unfortunately, I can tell you, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=558.5s)]
*  as a criminal defense attorney, due process often only requires notice and an opportunity [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=561.7800000000001s)]
*  to be heard. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=567.14s)]
*  The challenge with Kilmar Garcia and others in his position is that at most, maybe they're [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=568.14s)]
*  entitled to be returned and then put through the ordinary due process for removal. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=574.1s)]
*  And if there are grounds for removal, and removal doesn't always require a criminal [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=579.74s)]
*  conviction. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=583.86s)]
*  As a criminal defense attorney, that's the section of the statute I deal with all the [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=584.86s)]
*  time. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=588.4200000000001s)]
*  But there are others. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=589.4200000000001s)]
*  If you're on public assistance, for example, you are technically eligible to be removed. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=590.4200000000001s)]
*  And if, for example, in the case of Maumud Khalil, if the secretary of state determines [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=595.46s)]
*  that you pose a problem for foreign policy, whatever the heck that means, because no one [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=601.46s)]
*  appears to have ever used that subsection, I wasn't aware it was there, and it's right [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=606.86s)]
*  next to the section that every criminal defense attorney uses all the time, if that gives [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=610.94s)]
*  the secretary of state that kind of power, then maybe they can remove that person. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=615.98s)]
*  In a sense, that is not a constitutional crisis if it is legal. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=620.5400000000001s)]
*  If it is lawful under federal law. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=624.14s)]
*  Now, do we have a complaint that this law even exists to allow that? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=626.66s)]
*  Yes, but there it is. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=630.62s)]
*  Congress, for whatever reason, enacted that law. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=631.98s)]
*  And what the Trump administration is unbelievably good at is finding these subsections in these [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=635.14s)]
*  arcane statutes, dusting them off, and using them with really incredible efficiency. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BX4kdoiTXY&t=641.38s)]
