Video Description: A federal judge said in an order Wednesday that he has found probable cause to hold the Trump administration in contempt over deportation flights it sent to El Salvador. Also, in a new social media post, Hillary Clinton said 'If they can ship Kilmar Abrego Garcia to a foreign prison--accused of no crime, with no trial--they can do it to anyone.' The Morning Joe panel discusses.

# 'Must stand up against this now': Hillary Clinton shreds Abrego deportation
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM)
*  So let's get right to it. Remember, this is a fun show, right? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=0.0s)]
*  Absolutely. Yeah. Except our new brand is Nothing About This is Fun, right? At least [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=5.0s)]
*  that's what we were saying the other day. Nothing About This is Fun, but we're muddling [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=10.0s)]
*  through as best we can. The federal judge overseeing the Alien Enemies Act case says [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=14.84s)]
*  he has found probable cause to hold the Trump administration in contempt of court. In a [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=20.900000000000002s)]
*  new filing yesterday, Judge James Boasberg said the White House actions demonstrate a [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=26.72s)]
*  willful disregard of the court's order. He added, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=33.28s)]
*  The court does not reach such conclusion lightly or hastily. Indeed, it has given defendants [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=36.88s)]
*  ample opportunity to rectify or explain their actions. None of their responses have been [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=43.84s)]
*  satisfactory. Last month at an emergency hearing, Judge Boasberg ordered the Department of Justice [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  to turn around planes heading to El Salvador with hundreds of alleged Venezuelan gang members [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=57.28s)]
*  on board, no one getting the process that they should have had to be put on a flight [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=63.72s)]
*  such as this or leave the country thrown out. The flights did not return to the U.S. as [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=68.52s)]
*  ordered. The Justice Department stonewalled Boasberg from learning additional details [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=74.16s)]
*  about the timing of the flights. Judge Boasberg says he will give the government a chance [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=79.28s)]
*  to remedy the situation, but if it doesn't, he'll proceed to identify the people in contempt [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=83.94s)]
*  and refer the matter for prosecution. I'm going to go to Claire. You can take it to [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=90.6s)]
*  Lisa, the two legal minds at the table here. I guess, first of all, what has always been [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=96.16s)]
*  a little bit troubling to me in the coverage of the Abrego Garcia story is that that is [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=101.64s)]
*  a horrific story, and it absolutely, I guess on a political level, might actually move [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=106.44s)]
*  the meter a little bit. It gives a name, a face, a family to this incredible story of [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=112.28s)]
*  our laws being pushed to the limit or maybe even broken. And at the same time, all these [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=119.56s)]
*  other deportations, Claire, in a way calling Abrego Garcia a mistake is sort of giving [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=125.76s)]
*  subversive validation to these other deportees. All of their cases are legally questionable [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=133.66s)]
*  as well, and they continue. These flights continue. Your thoughts? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=140.52s)]
*  Yeah, I think that what this administration is doing is deciding that it's okay to be [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=146.56s)]
*  lawless. Keep in mind, there are ways to deport people in this country legally, and they have [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=153.88s)]
*  all kinds of ways they can, in fact, make these deportations go more quickly. But the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=160.04s)]
*  things they're doing now, many of them are really running afoul of the majority of what [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=166.56s)]
*  I don't think the majority of America thinks that you should revoke all the student visas [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=173.12s)]
*  of foreign students without any kind of rhyme or reason other than that they may have a [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=178.68s)]
*  different opinion than you do. I don't think, frankly, they think that someone who's lived [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=183.08s)]
*  in this country and has children and is married and has never broken the law should be deported, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=187.42000000000002s)]
*  especially if they've been here for a decade or longer. That's not what America thinks. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=192.44s)]
*  In fact, polling backs me up on this. So if they really want to deport folks, then all [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=196.0s)]
*  they've got to do is use the law to do it. Deport folks. Yeah. And I don't think, I mean, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=201.64s)]
*  most Americans think criminals that are here illegally should be deported. Focus on that [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=206.32s)]
*  and quit doing this lawless stuff that, frankly, they're going to lose a big chunk, especially [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=210.92s)]
*  of independent voters. And let me just jump in. If you guys could pull up the Hillary [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=216.64s)]
*  Clinton she posted, I believe on Blue Sky or Instagram yesterday. I'm going to read [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=220.2s)]
*  that. Go back to you, and you can take it to Lisa. You'll have a way better question [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=225.83999999999997s)]
*  than me because you guys are deep into this and understanding of the law. But Trump TV [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=229.8s)]
*  will tell you that, oh, the lefties on MSNBC, the Democrats, they don't want gang members [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=235.84s)]
*  to be thrown out of this country. Listen to them. That is not what we're saying. Just [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=241.4s)]
*  FYI, everybody wants criminals and gang members to be put into jail or put in a situation [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=245.88s)]
*  where they can't hurt people again. We're all with you there. You can't say that because [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=254.3s)]
*  you're lying when you do. What we are saying is that people deserve the process that is [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=260.1s)]
*  due to them, whether they are illegal immigrants or American citizens. And none of these people [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=268.22s)]
*  received any of that. And many of these people are being defamed by Trump TV, defamed by [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=276.1s)]
*  the president, defamed by Pam Bondi, defamed and being labeled things that they may not [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=282.98s)]
*  be. And in the case of Abrego Garcia, they're taking a baseball hat, a baseball hat and [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=290.22s)]
*  saying he's a terrorist because he's wearing a baseball hat. Who's crazy? Okay. So back [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=298.26s)]
*  to the Hillary Clinton post, Claire, she put this up. I don't know if it was yesterday, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=306.28000000000003s)]
*  but it came my way. Before the election, I warned that there's no safe haven under authoritarianism. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=312.41999999999996s)]
*  If they can ship Kilmar Abrego Garcia to a foreign prison accused of no crime with no [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=319.41999999999996s)]
*  trial, they can do it to anyone. Americans of conscience must stand against this now. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=324.82s)]
*  And, you know, the hope is, Claire, that there is a groundswell of support for our country [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=331.02s)]
*  in this country, for our constitution. Absolutely. And speaking of the constitution, this fire [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=339.74s)]
*  hose of legal cases that you are, I'm sure you've got some giant spreadsheet in your [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=346.02s)]
*  head, Lisa, but there are so many cases that are careening towards the ultimate showdown [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=350.66s)]
*  in the Supreme Court. How quickly will this Boasberg decision get to the Supreme Court, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=356.18s)]
*  if at all? I think there's a possibility that not this particular decision, but something [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=363.38s)]
*  stemming from it, Claire, is going to end up at the Supreme Court. Ultimately, right now, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=368.14s)]
*  all we have is a decision saying that he's found probable cause that there is not just contempt, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=372.7s)]
*  Mika, but criminal contempt. And I want to play out what that means. There are lots of different [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=377.42s)]
*  forms of judicial contempt, as Claire knows. Usually what happens in a case is you start from [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=382.46s)]
*  civil contempt, which is a fine, and then it might escalate if the disobedience continues. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=387.82s)]
*  Here, Boasberg has found that there's probable cause already to find that there's criminal [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=393.58s)]
*  contempt, and he's given the government two choices. And the choices are, by April 23, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=398.7s)]
*  a week from yesterday, you do one of two things. You either purge the contempt or you identify [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=403.9s)]
*  the people who are responsible for having made the decision not to turn the first two of the [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=408.94s)]
*  three planes that left on March 15th around. Now, Mr. Abrigo-Garcia is on the third of those planes, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=414.94s)]
*  somewhere north of 100 alleged members of Tren de Aragua are on the first two. But I want to [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=421.34s)]
*  underscore for our viewers how easy it would be to purge the contempt and what it means to cure it. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=428.38s)]
*  Because it's not that he's telling them, release all of these people from an El Salvadoran prison. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=434.46s)]
*  All he's saying to them is, he says this directly, I'm going to read from the order, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=440.14s)]
*  per the terms of the TRO, meaning his own temporary restraining order, the government would not need [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=444.94s)]
*  to release any of those individuals, nor would it need to transport them back to the homeland, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=449.58s)]
*  meaning the United States. All they have to do is retake custody of these people, put them back [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=454.94s)]
*  in U.S. hands, assure that their rights are being respected as opposed to placing them in a notorious [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=461.97999999999996s)]
*  Salvadoran prison that looks more like a concentration camp than it does anything resembling an American [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=467.9s)]
*  prison that I've been to see clients in. For example, Clara, you might have visited in your [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=473.5s)]
*  capacity as a law enforcement officer at some point in time. That is really startling, I think, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=477.58s)]
*  because I don't think people appreciate that's all the government needs to do here to resolve this [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=483.97999999999996s)]
*  issue that could lead to a showdown with the court. The other thing I want to underscore is that if we [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=489.97999999999996s)]
*  get to a point where the government says, okay, we're going to identify people, and Mika, you [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=497.97999999999996s)]
*  mentioned that he could appoint a prosecutor, there are going to be people on the right who say, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=503.18s)]
*  this is further proof that he is just lawless, he meaning Judge Boasberg. And there is ample [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=507.5s)]
*  precedent for doing so. The federal rules of criminal procedure require that in a situation [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=513.42s)]
*  of criminal contempt, first you refer to the Department of Justice, and if the Department [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=518.54s)]
*  of Justice says, no, we don't think a crime was committed here, the judge has every right to choose [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=522.06s)]
*  a lawyer of his or her own choosing to basically stand in the shoes of the government and prosecute [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=528.38s)]
*  criminal contempt. And it's happened before. It's happened here in New York. There's a sort of [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=533.74s)]
*  infamous environmental lawyer named Stephen Donsiger who served a term in prison for exactly this, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=538.62s)]
*  for criminal contempt, where there was a civil litigation. He was referred by a judge here in [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=544.6999999999999s)]
*  the Southern District. That case went up to the Supreme Court after his conviction was affirmed [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=549.42s)]
*  by an appeals court. And guess what? The Supreme Court did nothing to rescue him from that. So in [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=554.3s)]
*  the event that we get to a place where there is a finding of criminal contempt, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=559.42s)]
*  because there was a prosecutor appointed, make no mistake, we've seen that movie before. It [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=563.5799999999999s)]
*  won't be something wholly novel to this country. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHLPeINV2RM&t=569.18s)]
