Video Description: David Miliband, President of the International Rescue Committee, joined Morning Joe on World Refugee Day to highlight the record 122 million displaced people worldwide. Miliband urged U.S. leadership, warning that “if we don’t fix it together, it’s going to come and bite us.” He also noted that most refugees are hosted by poorer nations, not at the U.S. border, and that conflict—not economic hardship—is the primary driver of displacement.

# Refugees are 'America’s benefit'—not burden—as world hits record high in displacement
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE)
*  Well, today marks World Refugee Day, which is an internationally recognized day each [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=0.0s)]
*  year designated by the United Nations. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=6.24s)]
*  According to the UN Refugee Agency, right now there are more than 122 million people [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=8.96s)]
*  displaced from their homes around the globe. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=17.04s)]
*  This is an all-time high in that number. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=20.66s)]
*  Joining us now, President and CEO of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=23.68s)]
*  This organization serves refugees in 29 cities across the United States and was one of the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=28.8s)]
*  nation's largest refugee resettlement agencies prior to the start of the Trump administration. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=34.92s)]
*  David, it's good to have you on the show. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=41.52s)]
*  Explain if you could the significance of this day, especially this year. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=44.44s)]
*  Thanks very much, Mika. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=48.16s)]
*  I mean, it's a very striking figure, 122 million people displaced by violence and by conflict [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=49.16s)]
*  around the world. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=55.88s)]
*  More than a third of that number come from just four countries, Afghanistan, Syria, Sudan [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=57.32s)]
*  and Ukraine. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=62.6s)]
*  Here's the remarkable thing, though. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=63.6s)]
*  The number has doubled in the last 10 years. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=65.60000000000001s)]
*  I first came on this show 10 years ago to talk about the crisis in Syria, the civil [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=67.56s)]
*  war in Syria. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=71.64s)]
*  Then the number was around 50-55 million. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=74.48s)]
*  Today 122 million. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=76.92s)]
*  And these are not people seeking an economic better life. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=78.76s)]
*  They're people who are displaced by conflict. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=81.56s)]
*  And that's why I highlight those countries that I mentioned. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=84.44000000000001s)]
*  The Trump administration inherited from the Biden administration, at least in this aspect [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=87.08000000000001s)]
*  of the government's work, an effective program, the Refugee Resettlement Program, that brought [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=91.88000000000001s)]
*  in about 17,000 people through the International Rescue Committee, about 120,000 in total across [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  the US last year. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=103.80000000000001s)]
*  It's a very organized program, but it's been suspended by the Trump administration. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=104.80000000000001s)]
*  Obviously the International Rescue Committee, we work in the war zones like Ukraine, like [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=110.68s)]
*  Syria. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=115.64s)]
*  We see things across the arc of the crisis. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=116.64s)]
*  And these are people whose desperation is to go back to leading a normal life. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=119.72s)]
*  David Ignatius here in Washington. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=124.52000000000001s)]
*  You've been doing this wonderful work really since the days you were British Foreign Secretary. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=128.44s)]
*  I just want to ask you, in all those years of working with refugee issues, what's the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=133.96s)]
*  biggest thing you've learned about this problem and why it's so severe doesn't seem to get [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=138.88s)]
*  better? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=144.6s)]
*  What's the thing that you've taken away from it? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=145.6s)]
*  Well, I think it speaks directly to what you've all been talking about over the last hour, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=146.96s)]
*  that the costs of failed diplomacy are very high. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=151.4s)]
*  It's easy to start a war, but very hard to finish it. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=154.51999999999998s)]
*  And the human scale gets lost. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=158.28s)]
*  Was it Stalin who said that one person's death is a tragedy, a million people's death is [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=160.24s)]
*  a statistic? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=165.76s)]
*  That's the world that we're living in. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=167.4s)]
*  When I talk about an age of impunity, what I fear is that we're forgetting the human [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=168.52s)]
*  side of this. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=173.12s)]
*  David, it's Sam Stein here. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=174.4s)]
*  You called the refugee resettlement program a success under Biden. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=177.16000000000003s)]
*  You noted that Trump ended the program or is in the process of ending the program. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=181.0s)]
*  Look, I'm not sure you're going to convince the MAGA faithful here, but they look at this [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=185.24s)]
*  program and they say, this is not our problem. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=191.0s)]
*  These people are not American citizens. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=193.4s)]
*  We don't owe them our resources. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=195.56s)]
*  We have to take care of ourselves first because we have our own problems and they should take [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=197.72s)]
*  priority. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=201.88s)]
*  If you had the chance to just talk to one of them about what the inherent good is in [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=202.88s)]
*  helping refugees, what would you say? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=207.16s)]
*  It's not your problem, but it is your benefit. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=209.48000000000002s)]
*  Refugees have come to America from Einstein, who created the International Rescue Committee, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=212.12s)]
*  to Madeleine Albright, who ended up as your Secretary of State, to thousands of business [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=215.76000000000002s)]
*  people, sports people, entrepreneurs around the country. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=220.20000000000002s)]
*  They are America's benefit. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=223.44s)]
*  If you don't tackle humanitarian problems where they start, they end up coming to bite [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=226.2s)]
*  you. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=230.12s)]
*  That's the message that we keep giving. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=231.12s)]
*  It's an interdependent world. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=232.12s)]
*  If we don't fix it together, it's going to come and bite us in a very dangerous way. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=233.64s)]
*  I've just been to Syria and I had a chance to meet the people who've been displaced by [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=238.0s)]
*  violence there. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=241.84s)]
*  I met our staff. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=242.84s)]
*  I also met President al-Sharah, the new president of Syria. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=243.84s)]
*  In the last six months, 450,000 people have gone back to Syria. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=247.28s)]
*  These aren't people who want to exploit America. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=251.04s)]
*  They're people who want to rescue their own lives. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=253.36s)]
*  For the very small minority that are allowed in under the refugee resettlement program, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=257.16s)]
*  they become productive and contributing Americans. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=260.96000000000004s)]
*  And David, I wanted to talk to you about, as we've been talking about the debate centering [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=265.88s)]
*  around a possible regional war with Israel and Iran and the United States possibly coming [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=270.34000000000003s)]
*  in, I wanted to talk about how wars impact and create refugee crises. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=276.88s)]
*  You talked about Syria. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=282.6s)]
*  The Syrian civil war created perhaps the worst refugee crisis since World War II. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=284.26000000000005s)]
*  Talk about wars' negative impact on the refugee situation actually makes matters so much worse [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=290.74s)]
*  for refugees and increases the number. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=300.08000000000004s)]
*  Well, you're right to say I've been at this for some time. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=303.72s)]
*  I was actually foreign secretary of state in the UK when we discovered our special intelligence [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=307.24s)]
*  service. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=312.58s)]
*  They discovered the Fordow nuclear plant, which was a secret nuclear facility that the [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=313.58s)]
*  Iranians were running. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=317.97999999999996s)]
*  And that's part of diplomacy as well, bringing into the public domain that which is being [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=319.41999999999996s)]
*  done secretly. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=323.85999999999996s)]
*  But your point, without conflict, there wouldn't be refugees. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=324.86s)]
*  That's what the essence of the refugee crisis is. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=329.21999999999997s)]
*  And your highlighting of Syria, I mentioned Ukraine. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=333.7s)]
*  I can also mention Afghanistan. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=336.58s)]
*  Here's the truth that is often obscured. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=338.86s)]
*  Most refugees are not at the southern border of the United States. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=343.5s)]
*  The vast majority are in the poorest countries in the world. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=345.38s)]
*  75% of that 122 million figure you gave are in poor countries, not in rich countries. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=348.1s)]
*  And they're mainly in the countries next door to those in conflict. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=354.46000000000004s)]
*  The largest humanitarian crisis today is in Sudan. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=357.74s)]
*  I visited South Sudan, one of the poorest countries in the world. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=360.94s)]
*  My goodness, if you're fleeing to South Sudan, you have to be absolutely desperate. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=364.02000000000004s)]
*  But that's what people are doing, over 600,000 at the moment. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=368.82000000000005s)]
*  Conflict is the biggest driver of extreme poverty today. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=372.3s)]
*  If you're born in a stable country that's poor, but has a government, has property rights, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=375.65999999999997s)]
*  has markets, you've got a chance. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=380.26s)]
*  If you're born in the midst of conflict in Sudan or in Gaza or at the moment in Ukraine, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=382.21999999999997s)]
*  your chances are really very, very dim. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=387.14s)]
*  Ah, President and CEO of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband, thank you [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=390.09999999999997s)]
*  for coming on this morning. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=396.98s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=397.98s)]
*  And thank you for what you do. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=398.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj72kyi9hYE&t=402.26s)]
