# 'Painstaking work' begins now: Diplomacy prevents Iran from getting a bomb, says House member
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4)
*  It's bringing right now Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna of California. He's a member of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=0.0s)]
*  Armed Services Committee and is pushing for curves on the presidential war powers. Congressman, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=4.08s)]
*  on that topic, all I can say is the queue is very, very long. I remember Tom Campbell, a Republican, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  as well as other Democrats, complaining about Bill Clinton and his attacks on Kosovo [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  and not getting authorization from Congress. Obviously, every president, it seems, including, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=29.279999999999998s)]
*  I remember Barack Obama in 2011 and the attacks on Libya, not getting congressional authority. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=36.96s)]
*  What's so interesting about this is you might say, oh, well, if it's a Republican doing it, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=43.28s)]
*  only Democrats are angry. If it's a Democrat doing it, only Republicans are angry. In every single [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=48.16s)]
*  case, there seem to be members on both sides coming together and saying, hey, wait a second, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=52.96s)]
*  you've got to come to Congress first before taking military action. Is that the case here as well? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=60.64s)]
*  Joe, you're absolutely right. And presidents of both parties have violated the War Powers Act in [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=67.28s)]
*  Libya, in Yemen, now in Iran. And I came together with Thomas Massey to say you have to come to [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=72.08s)]
*  Congress. I think it made a difference. Look, I'm glad and relieved that we've gotten a ceasefire. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=78.8s)]
*  I hope it holds. I spoke to Thomas Massey last night, and we said we're going to wait and see, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=84.64s)]
*  and it may be moot in terms of getting a vote now on the War Powers resolution. But I think there [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=89.44s)]
*  are two things to realize here. One, this is the deepest anger that some of the MAGA bases had at [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=94.32s)]
*  Donald Trump. I mean, he really ran, saying he was going to have no more wars, no strikes. You've [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=100.8s)]
*  got people like Marjorie Taylor Greene, Tucker Carlson, Thomas Massey saying, look, this is not [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=105.68s)]
*  what we were promised. And Donald Trump was angry. I mean, he's threatening Thomas Massey, putting his [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=111.36000000000001s)]
*  top political people there, because he knows that the MAGA base was upset. And I think it's good [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=116.88000000000001s)]
*  that he actually listened to them, and he's now gotten a ceasefire. Thankfully, he's done that. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=122.48s)]
*  The question, though, is now what next? I mean, we've seen in this country these mission-accomplished [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=129.28s)]
*  moments. The question is, what's going to happen with the Iranian nuclear material that even JD [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=133.92s)]
*  Vance says they probably still have? They may make it covert. And the question is, are they going to [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=139.83999999999997s)]
*  kick out the inspectors? I hope the president is engaged in the hard work of diplomacy. It's much [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  easier to start wars than to end them and engage in actually diplomacy to prevent Iran from getting [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=151.04s)]
*  the bomb. Congressman, I wonder if this, the U.S. bombing in Iran, turns out to be a one-off, which [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=155.92s)]
*  is what we know President Trump hopes it will be. And if it, in fact, prompts this new optimism [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=162.32s)]
*  about reaching a more peaceful situation in the Middle East than we've seen in some time, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=170.16s)]
*  does that make it harder for you to press your case that he should have come to Congress [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=175.92s)]
*  in compliance with the War Powers Act? Not at all. Look, I was supporting President Trump when he [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=181.12s)]
*  was engaged in diplomacy. The reality is that Obama had a deal with the JCPOA. Tony Blinken [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=188.16s)]
*  lays it out, actually, in the New York Times. And the deal said that Iran couldn't enrich more than [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=197.12s)]
*  5 percent and that we had at least one year in terms of being notified if they got ever close [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=202.0s)]
*  to the bomb. And then Donald Trump came and he ripped that deal up in 2018. Many of us said, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=208.0s)]
*  let's get into that negotiation. Had he come to Congress, I think he would have been forced [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=213.76s)]
*  to engage in a negotiation. Now he's going to have to engage in that negotiation anyway. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=218.32s)]
*  And I think that it's important that he did hear Congress. It's because Massey, myself, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=223.35999999999999s)]
*  and other members of Congress started speaking up and the MAGA base and the left spoke up, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=227.92s)]
*  that Trump turned away from the neocons and actually did get the ceasefire. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=232.72s)]
*  So, Congressman, on a related matter, we've seen the president apply real pressure here [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=238.32s)]
*  on Israel and Iran. And I know you have your objections to some of his methods, but perhaps, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=243.44s)]
*  perhaps, a ceasefire will hold. My question to you is, should he be using similar pressure, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=248.48s)]
*  the weight of his office, for other global conflicts? Perhaps the situation in Gaza? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=254.24s)]
*  Would you like to see him take a similar tough tact to see what we've seen in Ukraine? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=260.96s)]
*  Right. Absolutely. Look, I'm glad that he's pressuring both Iran and Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=264.88000000000005s)]
*  not to have escalation of this conflict. I hope he will keep to, again, his campaign promise and [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=272.88000000000005s)]
*  bring the war to Gaza to an end. And he has the authority to do that. We've given $14 billion [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=278.24s)]
*  of sales to Netanyahu since he's been president. Hopefully, he can tell Netanyahu, end the war [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=284.32000000000005s)]
*  in Gaza. And then let's get Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Palestine involved in having a non-Hamas [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=290.32s)]
*  government in Palestine. Let's expand the Abraham Accords, something that I supported, actually, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=296.56s)]
*  Jared Kushner and others when they did it in the first term. And I hope he will also now [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=301.92s)]
*  stand with Zelensky against Russia's invasion. So, look, he's the American president. I need [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=307.2s)]
*  support him. I won his success. I'm glad that he got a ceasefire. But the painstaking work [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=312.4s)]
*  actually begins now because it's the diplomacy that's going to prevent Iran from getting a bomb [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=319.2s)]
*  and actually end the war in Gaza. Right. Congressman, let's change topics [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=324.47999999999996s)]
*  since we have you here. And by the way, we'd love to have you back a lot more to talk about [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=330.15999999999997s)]
*  the next topic I'm going to bring up. That is AI. Jim Van De Hei has been on several times. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=334.64s)]
*  I'm sure you've seen the reporting of the work that Jim and Mike Allen and Axios has done [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=340.56s)]
*  regarding the challenges, the threats from AI. They did an extensive report about how [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=346.08s)]
*  white collar jobs are going to be decimated by the rise of AI. And then they followed up [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=353.12s)]
*  about something a bit more significant, and that is how very people that are at the heart [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=360.64s)]
*  of the AI revolution put the risk of AI eventually wiping out humanity at like 10, 20 percent. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=367.92s)]
*  Not insignificant. There are a lot of Americans who are very concerned about the fact that the [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=378.08000000000004s)]
*  government does not have a better way to track AI developments. As the member who represents Silicon [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=384.8s)]
*  Valley, what do you think the best approach is? What do you think the best practices are to [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=395.28s)]
*  not only save jobs, but also save us against even graver threats in the future from AI? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=403.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, Joe, you identified precisely the two biggest challenges, jobs and also our safety [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=409.59999999999997s)]
*  and security. Let's talk about jobs very briefly first. You know what the most startling statistic [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=416.15999999999997s)]
*  in this country is? College graduates between the ages of 21 to 29 have a 15 percent unemployment [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=421.12s)]
*  rate. That could go up to 30 percent with AI. By the way, those who have trade school, vocational [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=428.24s)]
*  education, it's only 2 percent. So the question is, what are we going to do to make sure that we have [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=433.76s)]
*  jobs for young people, particularly in entry-level jobs? I think we have to have tax incentives and [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=439.76s)]
*  to hire them to create apprenticeships. We may want to create a future workforce administration, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=445.76s)]
*  so some people can come in, actually, to government to have those jobs. But we need a whole [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=450.4s)]
*  strategy about what we're going to do with AI. The second thing is the safety. And here, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=455.59999999999997s)]
*  you have bipartisan concern with Marjorie Taylor Greene, myself and others, with this bill, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=461.28s)]
*  which would basically ban any regulation for 10 years in states. They could not regulate AI. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=466.32s)]
*  That is a disaster. It would prevent states from protecting kids from online algorithms, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=472.64s)]
*  something, Joe, I know you're very concerned about, protecting truck drivers. The first thing [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=477.84s)]
*  we need to do is allow states to regulate it. Ultimately, I think we need a federal agency [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=482.0s)]
*  to regulate and have AI be safe. All right. Democratic congressman Ro Khanna of California, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=486.79999999999995s)]
*  thank you so much. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=493.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoeQdCXTzP4&t=507.84s)]
