# 'Original Sin' authors Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson on reporting behind new book
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA)
*  All right, joining us now, anchor and chief Washington correspondent for CNN Jake Tapper [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=0.0s)]
*  and national political correspondent for Axios Alex Thompson. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=5.12s)]
*  They are co-authors of the new book entitled, Original Sin, President Biden's Decline, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=9.0s)]
*  Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=14.64s)]
*  Interesting timing for the book, given everything. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=19.44s)]
*  Good to have you both on. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  I guess at first I'll start with kind of an obvious question, but Jake, is it fair to [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=24.92s)]
*  say that Joe Biden had a successful presidency, a remarkable presidency, possibly even a historic [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=29.48s)]
*  presidency in his time in office? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  Well, he certainly feels that way. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=38.28s)]
*  And we don't really render. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=40.56s)]
*  But when you look at the legislation that he passed and his accomplishments and how [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=41.56s)]
*  it ranks against other presidents. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=45.160000000000004s)]
*  I'm not here to render a verdict on how successful a president he was. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=48.0s)]
*  Certainly he feels that way. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=52.0s)]
*  You can point to any number of accomplishments he has, he had having to do with NATO or the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=53.86s)]
*  infrastructure bill or the CHIPS Act and on and on. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=58.34s)]
*  And that will be for history to decide. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=63.220000000000006s)]
*  Obviously, the American people thought that the country was on the wrong track and took [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=65.86s)]
*  issue with the border and inflation and his age and acuity. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=69.34s)]
*  But this book is more focused on what happened. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=75.22s)]
*  We all saw the debate June 27th. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=79.02000000000001s)]
*  We were all shocked. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=81.34s)]
*  We were all stunned at his inability to communicate his thoughts and the record that you speak [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=82.34s)]
*  of to the American people. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=89.22s)]
*  And Alex and I set out to figure out what happened. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=90.86s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=92.9s)]
*  So so so because questions a good question because he's always mocked and ridiculed by [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=93.9s)]
*  Democrats early on about, oh, you can't deal with Republicans. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=98.74000000000001s)]
*  You pass more bipartisan legislation than just about anybody. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=102.18s)]
*  I always talked about the Wall Street Journal article in June, which we ought to discuss, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=104.82000000000001s)]
*  which actually had to use Kevin McCarthy as a source who then contradicted what he [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=111.62s)]
*  said before. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=117.26s)]
*  And yet after that, he did some pretty intensive negotiations to get Evan out of Gaza. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=118.42s)]
*  So here here's the question. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=126.9s)]
*  And I think in reading the book, you all are not passing judgment. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=129.66s)]
*  But correct me if I'm wrong on whether he had the skills and the capabilities to run [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=133.82s)]
*  the White House effectively versus a political campaign. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=140.38s)]
*  Or are you saying that he was incapable of doing his duties as president of the United [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=144.34s)]
*  States? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=149.14000000000001s)]
*  I'm saying by 2024, there were members of the cabinet that did have some concerns, not [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=150.14000000000001s)]
*  necessarily about a day to day. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=154.26s)]
*  But what if there was a massive crisis in the middle of the night? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=155.62s)]
*  There were some cabinet members that did have concerns by that last year. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=158.92000000000002s)]
*  There were definitely people in this administration who wondered after the debate who wondered [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=163.06s)]
*  who was actually running the country. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=168.1s)]
*  That's not something that Alex and I say, but it is something that Democrats and people [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=170.42s)]
*  who worked for Biden wondered. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=174.62s)]
*  So so by the way, Evan was released from Russia, not not because. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=175.98s)]
*  So here here here's my question that I'd love for you guys to answer, because I was in [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=182.34s)]
*  there real time. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=191.42s)]
*  I was talking to people who were friends before the Biden administration with me, we'll be [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=193.38s)]
*  friends with me long after the Biden administration. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=197.34s)]
*  I talked about just about everybody, but I would just say out loud, never was close to [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=201.54s)]
*  Donlin, didn't really talk to him, much didn't talk to Rashadi. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=206.06s)]
*  And so the people I talked to, though, we had real time conversations over years. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=209.7s)]
*  So I'm curious, did you have 200 people telling you this guy was incapable of being [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=216.02s)]
*  president of the United States or this guy had changed so radically? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=221.34s)]
*  So I guess the what? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=224.82s)]
*  Do you understand my question? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=226.94s)]
*  Yes, because I know, though, whoever you talk to. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=227.9s)]
*  Yeah, I guess it's a good I know woman. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=230.78s)]
*  I've talked to him in real time and I never got that. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=232.82s)]
*  So one of the things that's very important to understand about the reporting from this [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=237.62s)]
*  book is that we spoke with 200 more than 200 people, most of them Biden loving [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=241.34s)]
*  Democratic insiders. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=247.78s)]
*  And almost all the interviews were after the election. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=249.14000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=251.78s)]
*  Because after the election, people felt much more free to come forward and talk. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=252.14s)]
*  Yeah, but wouldn't if you're a cabinet secretary and you say he can't do his basic, which [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=256.98s)]
*  is said in the book, the fourth thing I'm just asking, should those people be granted [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=261.9s)]
*  anonymity? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=268.14s)]
*  If I mean, how can you sit there if you knew he wasn't capable of leaving president of [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=268.94s)]
*  the United States? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=274.86s)]
*  It's a great question. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=275.54s)]
*  And then wait until he's had him off and say, OK, now I'm going to get this off my chest. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=276.26s)]
*  No, it's a little late. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=280.78s)]
*  It's absolutely a great question for the sources in the book. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=281.82s)]
*  And many of them expressed regret that they hadn't come forward until Election Day. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=285.09999999999997s)]
*  The bottom line is the reason that Biden, his wife, his son, Donald and Richety and [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=289.02s)]
*  others convinced themselves that what they were doing was in the best interest of the [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=295.02s)]
*  country was one, they thought only Joe Biden could defeat Donald Trump. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=299.58s)]
*  They were convinced of that. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=304.78s)]
*  Two, they thought that Donald Trump posed an existential threat to the republic. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=305.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=309.82s)]
*  And if you think that those are the that those are the stakes, you can justify almost [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=310.3s)]
*  anything. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=316.34s)]
*  Well, they also thought three, as you all point out, that Kamala Harris couldn't beat [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=316.97999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump. Right. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=320.53999999999996s)]
*  That's true. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=321.5s)]
*  That was driving. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=321.9s)]
*  And then I mean, how much of it was them looking for a reason versus what was the [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=322.74s)]
*  reality? But you go back to that 2019 primary, you know, come almost every candidate [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=328.06s)]
*  filled out that ACLU questionnaire. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=333.86s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=336.06s)]
*  Became infamous. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=336.3s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=337.06s)]
*  Joe Biden did not because they felt that it was going to take them too far to the left. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=337.46000000000004s)]
*  They knew that Kamala Harris had run to the left. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=341.82s)]
*  In fact, actually, some people in the Biden orbit said when they knew the title of our [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=344.06s)]
*  book, they were like the original sin actually was picking Kamala Harris because, you [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=348.42s)]
*  know, Biden's heart was with Gretchen Whitmer because he saw her as sort of a next [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=353.22s)]
*  generation of Biden Democrat. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=357.78000000000003s)]
*  But he picked Kamala Harris because it was, you know, we're going to unite the party. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=359.5s)]
*  We're not going to have a Bernie Hillary schism. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=362.74s)]
*  We're going to pick a more progressive person. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=365.3s)]
*  All right. A few thoughts and feelings and then a question. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=366.65999999999997s)]
*  I really loved reading the book. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=369.38s)]
*  It was really beautifully written. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=370.74s)]
*  Great reporting. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=373.41999999999996s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=374.41999999999996s)]
*  And it was. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=374.94s)]
*  Trust me, there has to be a bug coming here. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=376.9s)]
*  I know. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=380.78s)]
*  There is. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=381.86s)]
*  First down. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=382.53999999999996s)]
*  I really enjoyed reading it. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=383.02s)]
*  And there's stuff in there I didn't know before. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=384.21999999999997s)]
*  It was not news. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=387.18s)]
*  He was older. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=388.26s)]
*  Even even in the campaign that he won. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=389.41999999999996s)]
*  Sure. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=392.41999999999996s)]
*  He called a guy fat in New Hampshire and we all covered it in real time. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=392.86s)]
*  Sure. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=396.90000000000003s)]
*  He you know, I we've talked David Ignatius piece. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=397.26s)]
*  We debated this and covered this in real time. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=400.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=403.82s)]
*  And one of the contentions you make is that that's sort of the media didn't do its part [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=404.14s)]
*  or did like way too late. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=409.06s)]
*  And what's not in the book is the day after the debate, Joe very painfully, immediately [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=412.74s)]
*  says Biden should step out of the race. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=421.06s)]
*  It was really a big change for the direction of the show. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=423.14000000000004s)]
*  I personally went on a very long plea for him to stay in the race. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=427.86s)]
*  I still stand by it. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=432.42s)]
*  Nobody agrees with me. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=433.42s)]
*  But we debated this and we covered this. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=435.5s)]
*  And my point is that we did this in real time. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=438.90000000000003s)]
*  There is definitely new information in this book. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=442.86s)]
*  Great reporting. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=445.02000000000004s)]
*  But I want to understand why you're using words like cover up. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=446.38s)]
*  Which insinuates a crime or something was a crime committed because we're in an environment [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=451.02000000000004s)]
*  where we are covering an administration that is actually in office right now that is pushing [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=456.74s)]
*  the limits of the law in every way. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=461.90000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=464.06s)]
*  And so I which Alex and I cover every day at Axios. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=464.34000000000003s)]
*  I know you do. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=467.1s)]
*  But you've given hours and hours to this book. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=467.82s)]
*  And was there a cover up that is actually like a what's the cover up? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=470.14000000000004s)]
*  Well, we're not to be clear. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=474.58000000000004s)]
*  We're not arguing there's any sort of crime. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=476.38s)]
*  But I would say I mean, I watched you guys on the show the day after the debate. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=478.22s)]
*  I could see sort of the in some ways heartbreak and shock. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=481.66s)]
*  But you guys were shocked by that debate, right? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=485.54s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=487.58s)]
*  And I think the book very clearly shows that he had moments like that behind the scenes. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=488.18s)]
*  But there was before the debate. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=493.42s)]
*  There was not if there was not a cover up, then you guys wouldn't have been shocked. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=495.38s)]
*  Can I ask you this? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=498.42s)]
*  Were you shocked by the debate? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=499.66s)]
*  Of course, especially in person. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=501.54s)]
*  Were you shocked by the debate? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=503.22s)]
*  I was there. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=503.86s)]
*  I mean, I've been covering I've been pretty aggressively covering his and also I think [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=505.54s)]
*  there's a distinction between covering his age as a political matter versus like covering [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=509.58000000000004s)]
*  what was going on behind the scenes in order to fit his limitations, which is sort of what [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=513.9s)]
*  I was doing. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=518.62s)]
*  And so I was I wouldn't say I was shocked. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=519.1s)]
*  I was a little surprised it had gotten that bad. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=521.54s)]
*  Fitting his limitation. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=523.34s)]
*  Is that what's happening in today's administration? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=524.58s)]
*  I mean, I mean, so and really, I mean, the thing is, again, I talk to people that know [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=526.54s)]
*  Joe Biden extraordinarily well. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=531.7s)]
*  And I've said it on the show. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=533.6999999999999s)]
*  We talked before the debate. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=535.5799999999999s)]
*  They were pretty confident to his voice, his little raspy, but he's, you know, seems like [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=537.3399999999999s)]
*  he's ready to go. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=541.74s)]
*  And then five minutes into the debate, they called back and were like, did he have a [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=542.78s)]
*  stroke? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=545.8199999999999s)]
*  It was shocking in real time to a lot of people. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=546.8199999999999s)]
*  In hindsight, you go back and look and you watch his gate and all the times he fell, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=550.06s)]
*  his leg broke his foot a few years ago. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=554.38s)]
*  And he said that was a lot of right away. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=556.4599999999999s)]
*  He broke his foot, but that wasn't the reason why he walks. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=557.86s)]
*  Well, that's what I'm saying in hindsight now that, you know, that those were all sort [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=560.1s)]
*  of excuses pushed out by the White House. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=563.6600000000001s)]
*  I'm curious for both of you because it ties into the news we've been reporting this [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=565.6600000000001s)]
*  morning, Jake, I'll start with you about this, the PSA test, the cancer that he hadn't [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=570.3800000000001s)]
*  had a PSA test since 2014. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=575.1800000000001s)]
*  It boggles the mind to think that a president of his age and people say, well, men over [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=578.0200000000001s)]
*  70 don't always get them. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=582.4200000000001s)]
*  You're the president of the United States. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=583.58s)]
*  Did you all find anything that signaled he may have had cancer when he was running for [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=585.74s)]
*  president or someone knew while he was president? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=590.26s)]
*  No, absolutely not. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=593.02s)]
*  But I will say this, the cancer diagnosis, the prostate cancer diagnosis, and I know [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=594.1s)]
*  everybody here is wishing him the best and praying for him and his family. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=600.74s)]
*  It illustrates two things that I think are underlined in the book. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=604.38s)]
*  One, the difficulty of reporting anything having to do with health matters. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=606.82s)]
*  First of all, there's always a lack of transparency, whether it's the Bidens or the [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=610.62s)]
*  Trumps or whomever. They don't willingly share this information. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=614.14s)]
*  And two, it's difficult to report this stuff. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=616.58s)]
*  We don't have subpoena power. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=618.8199999999999s)]
*  We can't break into doctor's offices. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=620.1s)]
*  And it's very sensitive. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=622.02s)]
*  These are the most sensitive things about a person that there can be. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=623.22s)]
*  And the second point I'd make is this is a family that has long been reluctant to share [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=626.8199999999999s)]
*  information about health. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=633.6999999999999s)]
*  And as tragic as Bo Biden's death was and remains to this day, they were not transparent [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=635.42s)]
*  about what was going on with him. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=641.62s)]
*  And they were not transparent about what was going on with with President Biden when he [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=643.82s)]
*  was in the White House. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=647.9s)]
*  You can make the case, though, that their son's illness was a private matter. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=648.66s)]
*  And for them, he was sitting attorney general. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=652.3000000000001s)]
*  Right. But I mean, but if you're the president of the United States, your doctor and you [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=654.78s)]
*  write about this Dr. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=658.34s)]
*  O'Connor, who's very close to the president, may have had a responsibility at least to [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=659.34s)]
*  test right for prostate cancer. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=663.86s)]
*  Yeah. But you can also argue that he had a responsibility to do a cognitive test, which [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=666.7s)]
*  is normal for people over 65. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=671.5s)]
*  And he never did that either. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=672.98s)]
*  It's always a question that was raised by Dr. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=675.02s)]
*  Jonathan Reiner, who we interviewed for the book, who's a consultant to the White House [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=678.14s)]
*  medical team and has been for many, many years. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=681.86s)]
*  Why would you not give President Biden a cognitive test? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=685.78s)]
*  Well, because you don't want to know the answer. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=688.3s)]
*  That was what Reiner thought. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=690.78s)]
*  And he thinks that the way to fix this issue, not just for Biden, but for Trump and other [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=692.34s)]
*  future presidents, is the White House doctor should have to testify under oath. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=697.5s)]
*  He should have to submit his White House medical records under threat of perjury. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=702.18s)]
*  So every White House, no matter which party, Republican or Democratic administration, part [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=705.66s)]
*  of the job is to make the president look good, to make to make adjustments to the schedule, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=710.38s)]
*  to to set up systems they look good in versus them. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=714.66s)]
*  They don't eliminate those. They don't. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=718.34s)]
*  You know, and that's not just second term Ronald Reagan, which is the most famous example, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=719.9s)]
*  but also much younger presidents. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=723.18s)]
*  And also right now, frankly, President Trump, his team works the rest. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=725.26s)]
*  So so why what makes this administration what they did to protect their principle? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=728.42s)]
*  Yes. Why is that a cover up in some of these others would be? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=733.14s)]
*  Well, I think a lot of these things started innocently enough, to your point. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=735.78s)]
*  You know, the speech writing team early on realized that he couldn't give the speech [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=738.62s)]
*  speeches the way he used to. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=741.9s)]
*  And so the vocabulary shrunk, the sentences shrunk, the paragraph shrunk. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=743.14s)]
*  But by the end of 2023, I think it becomes clear that there is a bigger issue than just [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=747.18s)]
*  him struggling in ways beyond our normal principle, that there's actually a decline [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=753.2199999999999s)]
*  and in his ability to do the job. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=759.66s)]
*  And I think there is a point when loyalty there's there's always a tension between [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=761.9s)]
*  loyalty to the principle and loyalty to the larger institution. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=765.8599999999999s)]
*  And I think it was at that point that there was that tension. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=769.0999999999999s)]
*  And I think they chose loyalty to the principle. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=772.06s)]
*  And who is that? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=774.02s)]
*  And this is why I really again, because again, I know so many of the people that I'm [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=775.3399999999999s)]
*  sure you all talk to off the record who again, in real time, we were sort of trying [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=779.78s)]
*  to sort through and figure this out. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=785.1s)]
*  But who is the who in this conspiracy? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=787.18s)]
*  I mean, the people the inner circle. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=790.54s)]
*  Yeah, the people that were in charge were Mike Donilon, Steve Reschetti, Bruce Reed, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=792.18s)]
*  Anthony Bernal, the First Lady's chief chief of staff, the First Lady and Annie [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=796.66s)]
*  Tomasini. Those are the people that saw him the most and that had the most control over [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=800.98s)]
*  what he was doing and his day to day. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=805.14s)]
*  One other thing, just to your point, Jonathan, is that there is a difference between [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=807.94s)]
*  making sure that the principal, the president, has a teleprompter for when he's giving [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=811.94s)]
*  remarks in the East Room and having a teleprompter when he is doing private remarks [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=816.22s)]
*  in a 40 person fundraiser in Chicago. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=821.9s)]
*  Right. I mean, you would admit that like you would acknowledge that. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=824.1800000000001s)]
*  But that's one of them. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=826.62s)]
*  Sure. Understandably, you want to have your remarks ready to go in front of the American [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=828.02s)]
*  people because you want to make sure that you're saying the right thing and you're [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=832.38s)]
*  being presidential at private event with 40 or 50 people in Chicago that you have to [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=835.5s)]
*  have a teleprompter. Why do you have to have a teleprompter at that? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=840.62s)]
*  I mean, to that point we did, though, because what you said earlier covered in real time. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=842.7s)]
*  I was in the presidential pool for one of these fundraisers. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=846.14s)]
*  It was in New York City. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=849.18s)]
*  And President Biden, at the time, he gave us he told a story. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=850.46s)]
*  He kind of lost his way in his notes. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=853.98s)]
*  He told the story again. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=855.62s)]
*  And we wrote about the Charlotte school story. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=856.86s)]
*  Forgetting that he had. So we wrote about it at the time. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=858.46s)]
*  We covered it here as well. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=860.7s)]
*  You are absolutely right. And since it was widely covered and there are new things in [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=861.66s)]
*  the book, but they are things to two things. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=865.34s)]
*  There were things that we covered similar to what we covered. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=869.22s)]
*  And also, Joe Biden, the way he is like the Biden is, as we call it in the book, you [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=872.62s)]
*  know, where he called the guy fat in New Hampshire and or if people came after him, they [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=879.38s)]
*  people still like they're like, hey, get off our guy. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=884.6600000000001s)]
*  So we love Joe Biden. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=887.7s)]
*  I think everybody would agree that we all saw him aging. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=889.02s)]
*  Yes. That happens to people. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=892.62s)]
*  Yes, of course. Happens to me right now. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=894.62s)]
*  Not news. Yeah. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=896.34s)]
*  Well, it's news in the sense that when one of these incidents would happen, you guys [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=898.94s)]
*  would air them. We would air them. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=902.18s)]
*  It's a show. Yes. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=903.3s)]
*  The question is, what else was going on? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=904.86s)]
*  Because I would argue that there's a difference between learning, as we reveal in the [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=907.54s)]
*  book, that he didn't recognize George Clooney at that fundraiser or that he couldn't [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=910.94s)]
*  come up with the name of Jake Sullivan behind the scenes. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=914.94s)]
*  And that's that's the not not being able to recognize George Clooney. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=918.38s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I I saw George Clooney. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=924.62s)]
*  Fine. OK, anyway, we're going to or not knowing that not being able to come up with the [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=928.5s)]
*  name of his national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, there's a difference between that [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=931.98s)]
*  or people senators that we that we refer to in the book having serious questions about [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=935.9s)]
*  how much President Biden is actually running things. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=939.82s)]
*  Those that's different. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=942.26s)]
*  And I would argue more significant than Biden tripping on a commencement. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=943.7s)]
*  So what I want to go to ultimately is what the takeaways are for the future. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=947.34s)]
*  Democrats or Republicans find themselves in a situation like this. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=951.66s)]
*  And by the way, can we all remember Trump's doctor? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=954.78s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. The report about his health. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=959.1s)]
*  Oh, Trump. Trump is older than Joe Biden was when he was inaugurated. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=962.1s)]
*  And we know nothing about Trump's health. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=965.54s)]
*  We have no idea. Yeah. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=967.78s)]
*  So this is not covering. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=969.14s)]
*  This is not an excuse for Donald Trump. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=971.54s)]
*  Right. So what are the takeaways? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=973.82s)]
*  What do we learn here for future situations that could be similar that the party can [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=975.18s)]
*  learn? I'd say two things. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=980.38s)]
*  One is what Jake was referencing earlier, which is that having sort of mandated health [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=981.98s)]
*  disclosures for presidents, given the amount of power that they have and maybe having [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=986.42s)]
*  some sort of, you know, under oath mechanism. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=990.98s)]
*  The other thing I would say is, you know, the Democrat Democrats often mock rightly [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=994.14s)]
*  that Republicans say something different about Trump in private than they do in public. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=998.82s)]
*  They don't have the guts to say it. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1001.9399999999999s)]
*  And I think this book conclusively shows that Democrats knew and had serious concerns. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1003.3s)]
*  You guys sort of talked about some of the private concerns, but no one was willing to [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1008.14s)]
*  go public. And I think it shows that you need to listen to your voters and be responsive [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1011.9399999999999s)]
*  to them because the voters were ahead of the curve of where Democratic leaders were. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1017.5s)]
*  Well, the voters voted for Joe Biden in 2024. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1021.06s)]
*  Twenty twenty. You mean the primary primary. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1027.34s)]
*  Oh, yeah. But they I mean, that was not a fair primary. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1029.86s)]
*  I mean, they changed the order of the states. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1032.66s)]
*  They didn't allow for any debates. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1035.06s)]
*  And the chairman of the Wisconsin Democratic Party tried to keep Dean Phillips off the [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1037.94s)]
*  ballot that went all the way up to the Wisconsin Supreme Court to put him on the ballot. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1041.74s)]
*  But I mean, did you ever see a poll, though, that? [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1045.5s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. I don't know that it's so much of a conspiracy as Democrats [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1050.66s)]
*  looked at the fact that Biden was way ahead in the vote. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1054.6200000000001s)]
*  We never saw a poll that suggested certainly not that Dean Phillips could run a close [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1057.78s)]
*  race or Gretchen Whitmer or or anybody else. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1061.74s)]
*  Well, nobody's alleging that because Joe Biden didn't have a serious primary challenge [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1065.22s)]
*  that that was a conspiracy. That's just incumbency in the protection. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1069.78s)]
*  Right. Exactly. That's not that's not part of it. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1072.86s)]
*  But I would argue, although Alex's point is correct, that the Democratic Party tried to [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1075.02s)]
*  make sure that that was as uncompetitive as possible. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1079.54s)]
*  But that's not abnormal. I think the question is, why did people [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1081.6200000000001s)]
*  who had serious questions about whether or not Joe Biden should run for reelection? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1087.06s)]
*  Why were they so quiet? And they were those people, people inside the White House. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1091.14s)]
*  We have Anita Dunn saying in 2023, you know, are we sure this is a good idea? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1095.02s)]
*  Jeff Zients becomes the chief of staff and he's surprised that, you know, having come [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1100.22s)]
*  from Bain Capital, he's surprised there's been no stress testing of this idea. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1104.42s)]
*  John Anzolone, pollster for Biden, who's been with him since the 1988 campaign. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1108.22s)]
*  Right. 1987. I guess he never made it to 88. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1113.5800000000002s)]
*  But comes in and says, let's do some polling on this. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1116.5800000000002s)]
*  Let's let's find out whether or not this is a good idea, what the advantages and [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1118.82s)]
*  disadvantages are. And Anita Dunn says to him, there's there's no polling. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1122.06s)]
*  The decision's been made. I mean, why was this decision with very little process [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1126.42s)]
*  or conversation allowed to continue? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1131.18s)]
*  And then when people saw moments behind the scenes and we have one very compelling one, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1133.26s)]
*  you were you were in Ireland when President Biden was in Ireland in April 2023. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1138.58s)]
*  There's a very compelling scene with Congressman Quigley [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1143.34s)]
*  seeing Joe Biden behind the scenes melting away, unable to really function. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1146.8600000000001s)]
*  And it reminds him in a very moving way, because this is a tragedy. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1153.66s)]
*  Let's remember that. This is a tragedy. This is sad. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1157.6200000000001s)]
*  It reminds him of his dad who died of Parkinson's. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1160.3000000000002s)]
*  Why were the why was there so little incentive for anybody to say anything about? [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1163.42s)]
*  I don't know that this guy is up for the job at the very least of running for [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1168.18s)]
*  reelection, not to mention, can he be president in January 2029? [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1171.94s)]
*  Is there anybody at this table who thinks that he could be functioning president [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1175.82s)]
*  until January 2029? [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1179.26s)]
*  So let's talk about you talked about Ireland and we talked about what the [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1181.42s)]
*  Democrats can learn. Let's talk about what you can learn and what I can learn. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1186.7s)]
*  But I saw Biden in Ireland. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1190.14s)]
*  I went to two events there one day. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1192.7s)]
*  They had a winding. I was exhausted. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1195.5s)]
*  I think I did six of them. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1197.14s)]
*  Complain. Yeah, very, very. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1198.7s)]
*  I called home bitching and God, I am dying. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1200.8600000000001s)]
*  Like throwing up on the side of the road. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1205.06s)]
*  It's like this is, you know, but winding all around. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1207.1s)]
*  Biden does six events. And so I go away from that. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1210.1399999999999s)]
*  I see him the next day interviewing. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1212.58s)]
*  He's you know, he's he's he's doing well. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1214.1s)]
*  He has a hero's reception in Ireland. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1216.82s)]
*  I have, you know, told you about going in and talking to him for two and a half, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1218.78s)]
*  three hours inside the White House. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1223.26s)]
*  Far beyond Kojic. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1226.06s)]
*  I really, really has a better and has a grasp [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1227.3799999999999s)]
*  of international politics in a way that only somebody has been doing it since he [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1232.82s)]
*  was 29 years old. Sure. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1237.3s)]
*  We get phone calls at home where the guy is like pounding me because of op eds [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1238.6599999999999s)]
*  that I wrote, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1242.6599999999999s)]
*  So, you know, I said that this was Biden that is at his best. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1244.74s)]
*  Sure. That's what I saw. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1250.54s)]
*  I don't doubt other people's. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1252.78s)]
*  I was obviously wrong. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1254.86s)]
*  So I'm not sure what my takeaway is here the next time. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1256.3799999999999s)]
*  But if you're around a guy for hours and hours and hours, I guess the question is. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1260.62s)]
*  What's the takeaway here? [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1267.3s)]
*  What did you learn? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1268.8999999999999s)]
*  Because what did you did you pick it up in real time? [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1270.2199999999998s)]
*  So well, I just I saw what everybody else saw. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1273.82s)]
*  Right. I saw what everybody else saw. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1276.6599999999999s)]
*  The stumbles in front of the camera and that. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1278.1399999999999s)]
*  But I saw him in person in for the State of the Union lunch [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1280.1799999999998s)]
*  and that they do with anchors in early 2023. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1285.06s)]
*  And then I didn't see him in person. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1288.06s)]
*  Other than that, I will say two things. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1289.66s)]
*  One of them is there were more moments of non-functioning Biden behind the scenes [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1292.66s)]
*  that then we were privy to that we that we saw than what we saw. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1298.78s)]
*  If there are two Joe Biden's is the one that you saw that you just described. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1303.66s)]
*  And then there's the one who's non-functioning like what we saw at the debate night. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1307.0600000000002s)]
*  Can't follow his train of thought. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1311.1000000000001s)]
*  Can't come up with names. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1312.78s)]
*  Can't remember dates. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1313.8600000000001s)]
*  What you listen to in the her report or he's like unsure of when his son deployed, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1314.78s)]
*  unsure of when his son died. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1318.62s)]
*  Tragic stuff, but he really honestly doesn't know those dates. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-4b77G6AnA&t=1320.6599999999999s)]
