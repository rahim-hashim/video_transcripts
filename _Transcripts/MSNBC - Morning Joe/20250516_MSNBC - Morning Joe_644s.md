# 'This isn't a close case': California AG slams Trump, says birthright citizenship is bedrock
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8)
*  The Supreme Court appears to be expressing concerns about how lower courts should handle [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump's executive order on ending birthright citizenship. Yesterday, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=5.04s)]
*  justices heard oral arguments on a series of Trump's emergency requests that seek to limit [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=9.84s)]
*  the scope of nationwide injunctions to block that order. Justice Elena Kagan pointed out that so far, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=15.44s)]
*  the Trump administration has lost every case in which this order was challenged, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=21.44s)]
*  while conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh questioned the Solicitor General about the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=25.76s)]
*  practical problems with blocking Trump's executive order in some parts of the country, but not in [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  others. And then they win, and again, I mean you need somebody to lose, but nobody's going to lose [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=35.36s)]
*  in this case. It's just you're going to have like individual by individual by individual, and all of [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=44.32s)]
*  those individuals are going to win, and the ones who can't afford to go to court, they're the ones [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=52.16s)]
*  who are going to lose. The tools that are provided to address hypotheticals like this, again I... [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=56.72s)]
*  This is not a hypothetical, this is happening out there, right? Every court has ruled against you. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=62.8s)]
*  We've only had snap judgments on the merits, you know, obviously we're fully briefing the merits [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=67.44s)]
*  in the courts of appeals, and our arguments are compelling more fundamentally in response to the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=71.67999999999999s)]
*  question. I'm suggesting to you, like the real brunt of my question is in a case like this, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=76.88s)]
*  the government has no incentive to bring this case to the Supreme Court, because it's not really [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=82.0s)]
*  losing anything. It's losing a lot of individual cases which still allow it to enforce its CEO [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=86.56s)]
*  against the vast majority of people to whom it applies. On the day after it goes into effect, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  it's just a very practical question how it's going to work. What do hospitals do [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  with a newborn? What do states do with a newborn? I don't think they do anything different. What [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=104.4s)]
*  the executive order says in section two is that federal officials do not accept [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  documents that have the wrong designation of citizenship from people who are subject to the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=115.36000000000001s)]
*  executive order. How are they going to know that? The states can continue to... the federal officials [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=119.12s)]
*  will have to figure that out. How? So you could imagine a number of ways that the federal officials [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=123.60000000000001s)]
*  could... Such as? Such as they could require a showing of documentation showing legal presence [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=130.16s)]
*  in the country for a temporary visitor. For example, they could see whether they're on a B1 [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=135.76s)]
*  visa, which would exclude the birthright citizenship in that country. For all the newborns? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=140.07999999999998s)]
*  Is that how that's going to work? Again, we don't know. A little skepticism there from Justice [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=145.12s)]
*  Kavanaugh later when Trump's Solicitor General hedged on whether the administration is committed [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=151.6s)]
*  to abiding by any court ruling. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a Trump appointee, said this. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=156.4s)]
*  Did I understand you correctly to tell Justice Kagan that the government wanted to reserve its [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=163.76000000000002s)]
*  right to maybe not follow a second circuit precedent, say, in New York because you might [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=169.12s)]
*  disagree with the opinion? Our general practice is to respect those precedents, but there are [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=174.4s)]
*  circumstances when it is not a categorical practice. And that is not... This administration's [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=180.72s)]
*  practice or the long-standing practice of the federal government? And I'm not talking about in [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=185.68s)]
*  the Fourth Circuit. Are you going to respect a second circuit? I'm talking about within the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=189.28s)]
*  Second Circuit. And can you say, is that this administration's practice or a long-standing one? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=193.20000000000002s)]
*  As I understand it, long-standing policy of the Department of Justice. Yes, that we generally, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  as it was phrased to me, generally respect circuit president, but not necessarily in every case. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=202.56s)]
*  And certain examples, some examples might be a situation where we're litigating to try and get [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=207.44s)]
*  that circuit president overruled and so forth. Well, okay, so I'm not talking about a situation [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=211.6s)]
*  in which, you know, the Second Circuit has a case from 1955 and you think it's time for it to be [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=216.64s)]
*  challenged. That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about in this kind of situation. I'm [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=222.0s)]
*  talking about this week the Second Circuit holds that the executive order is unconstitutional, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=225.76s)]
*  and then what do you do the next day or the next week? Generally, we follow that. So you're still [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=230.72s)]
*  saying generally? Yes. And you still think that it's generally the policy, long-standing policy [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=234.95999999999998s)]
*  of the federal government to take that approach? That is my understanding. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=239.76s)]
*  That is Justice Amy Coney Barrett talking to Donald Trump's Solicitor General. Joining us now, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=243.28s)]
*  California's Attorney General Rob Bonta. In January, he filed one of the lawsuits challenging Trump's [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=247.84s)]
*  executive order on birthright citizenship and co-leads the coalition against it. MSNBC contributor [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=253.35999999999999s)]
*  Mike Barnicle joins the conversation as well. Gentlemen, good morning to you both. Mr. Bonta, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=259.28s)]
*  so this was the first lawsuit, as I understand it, that you filed against an executive order [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=264.32s)]
*  this President, something you had been well prepared for. You're on good constitutional [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=269.68s)]
*  ground, as we heard in court yesterday. The 14th Amendment guarantees birthright citizenship. Even [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=273.76s)]
*  if your parents aren't citizens, if you're born in the United States, you get citizenship. So we can [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=278.48s)]
*  talk about that part of the case, but let's talk also more broadly about the question that we were [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=283.76s)]
*  hearing debated there about whether a district judge can file a nationwide injunction that extends [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=289.52s)]
*  far beyond the jurisdiction of that court. Absolutely. This was our first lawsuit of the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=297.04s)]
*  22 lawsuits that we brought against the Trump administration in 16 weeks. It was based on a [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=303.6s)]
*  day one action, an executive order by the Trump administration seeking to revoke birthright [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=308.16s)]
*  citizenship and amend the U.S. Constitution through the stroke of a pen in an executive order, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=313.6s)]
*  and that's something you can't do. And you're right, we're on great constitutional ground, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=318.08000000000004s)]
*  whether it be the black letter law right there in black and white in the 14th Amendment citizenship [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=322.16s)]
*  clause or the U.S. Supreme Court cases that have interpreted it, birthright citizenship is bedrock [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=326.48s)]
*  foundational constitutional law. It's a right owed to all in the United States of America. Now, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=330.88s)]
*  what about the nationwide injunctions? This is a perfect case for a nationwide injunction. It's a [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=336.88s)]
*  constitutional right that applies broadly to everyone in the United States. If you're born on [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=341.20000000000005s)]
*  American soil, then you are a citizen, period, full stop. It doesn't matter what state you're born [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=346.40000000000003s)]
*  in. If you're born in a red state, you don't get U.S. citizenship because the attorneys general of [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=351.28s)]
*  that state didn't bother to fight for your rights. But if you are in a blue state who did stand up to [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=357.52s)]
*  fight for your constitutional rights, then you do get U.S. citizenship. That doesn't make sense. It [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=361.52s)]
*  belongs to everyone, regardless of the state that you are born in. And so this is a perfect case in [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=365.28s)]
*  my respectful, humble opinion for a nationwide injunction. We got three of them in three different [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=371.52s)]
*  cases in three different district courts upheld by three different circuit courts. So as some of [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=378.4s)]
*  the justices were mentioning in some of the dialogue that you just excerpted, this isn't a [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=383.35999999999996s)]
*  close case and a nationwide injunction is very appropriate here. General, I'm curious of the [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=389.03999999999996s)]
*  other lawsuits you filed. Could you give us, in your opinion, which are the ones that you feel [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=394.88s)]
*  are most urgent? Which are the cases besides the birthright citizenship? Where do you see [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=402.8s)]
*  the next big issue coming to fruition in terms of a Supreme Court decision that could impact [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=410.40000000000003s)]
*  how this administration is behaving in many ways outside the law? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=417.68s)]
*  We have quite a few cases that follow a similar pattern from the federal administration in which [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=423.92s)]
*  they appear to be a repeat offender, which is that they're trying to stop already [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=430.08s)]
*  congressionally appropriated funding from flowing. In one case, our second case, through an Office of [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=436.71999999999997s)]
*  Management and Budget memo that sought to halt three trillion, with a T, dollars of already [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=442.32s)]
*  congressionally appropriated funding for critical, essential programs and services to all the states, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=448.15999999999997s)]
*  about 168 billions worth of funding in California for health care and housing and food and college [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=453.84s)]
*  and child care and public safety, disaster relief. Congress has the power of the purse. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=459.68s)]
*  Congress can appropriate. Congress can spend. The president can't. But the president wants that power [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=466.16s)]
*  very urgently. It's not his. He can't. And so there's a number of cases in which he has violated [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=472.56s)]
*  the U.S. Constitution, the separation of powers, violated the law, and that issue may go up to the [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=477.92s)]
*  U.S. Supreme Court as well at some point. Mike Barnacle, it does this narrow question about [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=485.52s)]
*  birthright citizenship. It seems pretty plain that you cannot override the Constitution [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=490.56s)]
*  with an executive order, but this larger question about whether district courts can issue nationwide [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=496.24s)]
*  injunctions and stop executive orders from the president really was at the heart of what that [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=502.32s)]
*  debate was yesterday during oral arguments. You know, Willie, at one level, it boggles the [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=507.03999999999996s)]
*  mind that we're talking about this being dropped before the Supreme Court. And yet on another [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=515.28s)]
*  level, given the context of politics today in this country, it's not surprising at all. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=519.36s)]
*  But General Bonta, let me ask you, California would seem to be particularly vulnerable to [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=524.56s)]
*  a change in the birthright citizenship law, given its proximity to an open border. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=529.8399999999999s)]
*  And so could you address that, the vulnerability of your state? But also, if you could take your [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=535.68s)]
*  constitutional hat off, legal hat, and talk about the politics of it, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=542.8s)]
*  where do you sense a movement like this from the administration comes from? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=548.9599999999999s)]
*  California is the largest state in the nation, and nearly 40 million people. We are a border [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=555.4399999999999s)]
*  state. I'll push back a little bit on your description as an open border. But we are a [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=559.36s)]
*  border state. We have about 25,000 babies born every year that are entitled to the privileges, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=563.68s)]
*  and advantages of birthright citizenship. And look, this is a fringe theory that the [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=570.8s)]
*  Trump administration is trying to mainstream. No court has ever agreed with this fringe theory. But [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=578.16s)]
*  it's perhaps a policy proposal that they favor. Maybe some of their base support it as well. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=584.7199999999999s)]
*  And if you want that to be the new constitutional rule of the United States, then go get a [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=591.1999999999999s)]
*  constitutional amendment. That's the way to do it. You need two-thirds of the House and two-thirds [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=596.08s)]
*  of the Senate to vote for this constitutional amendment, then you've got to go get three-fourths [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=601.2s)]
*  of the states to ratify it. There's a process. It's right there in the U.S. Constitution. That [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=604.5600000000001s)]
*  process is not an executive order issued by the president. Right, and they have none of those that [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=608.64s)]
*  you just laid out. That's why they're going the route of executive orders. California Attorney [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=616.8000000000001s)]
*  General Rob Bonta, thanks so much for being here. We appreciate it. Thanks for having me. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrucsjSCJK8&t=620.5600000000001s)]
