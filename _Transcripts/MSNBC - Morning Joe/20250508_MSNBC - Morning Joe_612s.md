# Trump needs to get moving fast and deliver more on trade: Senator slams 'chaotic' tariff rollout
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw)
*  Joining us now, Democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=0.0s)]
*  The Senator serves on the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, as well as [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=4.0s)]
*  the Appropriations, Foreign Relations, and Judiciary Committees. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=8.2s)]
*  He's a busy man. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=11.72s)]
*  Senator, thanks for joining us this morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=12.72s)]
*  Let's, a lot of ground to cover with you, but let's start with this news here. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=15.36s)]
*  The trade deal with the UK, expected to be announced at about an hour's time. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=18.64s)]
*  Your reaction to that, but also in terms of where it fits in President Trump's larger [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=22.68s)]
*  approach on trade. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=27.32s)]
*  You just heard him there in that sound talk about, you know, just even acknowledging that [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=29.28s)]
*  there's a lot of inconsistency and uncertainty stemming from his policies. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=33.68s)]
*  Well, President Trump promised that he would lower prices on American families on day [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=38.400000000000006s)]
*  one. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=43.52s)]
*  And here we are well past day 100. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=44.52s)]
*  And I believe Jerome Powell, the head of the Federal Reserve, that Trump's chaotic tariff [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=46.88s)]
*  rollout has in fact increased prices and reduced growth in the American economy. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=51.44s)]
*  We'll see what he actually announces later today with the UK. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=57.919999999999995s)]
*  But the EU, a much larger economic block than the single country of the UK, is readying [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=61.44s)]
*  100 billion euros of tariffs on American products. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=67.24s)]
*  So if he doesn't get moving fast and deliver more, we're going to see really big impacts [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=71.75999999999999s)]
*  on the household budgets of hundreds of millions of Americans. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=78.25999999999999s)]
*  And that's coming down the pike fast. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=82.92s)]
*  Vice President J.D. Vance offered a candid assessment of where negotiations stand between [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=85.44s)]
*  Russia and Ukraine yesterday, speaking at a Munich leaders meeting on international [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=90.28s)]
*  security policy in Washington. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=95.74s)]
*  Vance said the United States believes Russia is asking for too much at the bargaining table. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=98.48s)]
*  I wouldn't say that the Russians are uninterested in bringing this thing to a resolution. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=105.2s)]
*  What I would say is right now the Russians are asking for a certain set of requirements, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=110.0s)]
*  a certain set of concessions in order to end the conflict. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=115.48s)]
*  We think they're asking for too much. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=119.2s)]
*  There's a big gulf, predictably, between where the Russians and the Ukrainians are. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=121.28s)]
*  And we think the next step in the negotiation is to try to close that gulf. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=126.08s)]
*  We think it's probably impossible for us to mediate this entirely without at least some [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=129.88s)]
*  direct negotiation between the two. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=134.82s)]
*  And so that's what we focused on. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=137.04s)]
*  Hours later, President Trump was asked about Vance's comments. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=140.0s)]
*  Vice President Vance said Russia was asking for too much to end the war. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=143.76s)]
*  Given that, do you still have confidence that— [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=150.2s)]
*  When did he say that? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=152.4s)]
*  — earlier this morning? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=153.4s)]
*  Well, it's possible that he's right. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=154.4s)]
*  He may know some things that—because I've been dealing with this and some other things. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=156.56s)]
*  But we are getting to a point where some decisions are going to have to be made. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=161.56s)]
*  I'm not happy about it. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=168.4s)]
*  I'm not happy about it. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=170.44s)]
*  All right, Senator. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=173.84s)]
*  I don't even know what to make of that answer, actually. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=174.84s)]
*  So I am so worried the U.S. is turning its back on Ukraine. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, Mika, if Vice President Vance is waking up to the idea that Russia under Putin is [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=184.96s)]
*  an aggressor, that's a good thing. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=190.88s)]
*  But it makes me heart sick on the 80th anniversary of our victory in Europe over aggression and [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=194.67999999999998s)]
*  fascism that it's so hard for President Trump and Vice President Vance to see clearly that [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=202.32s)]
*  Putin has been playing them for months, that he has no intention of coming to the table [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=209.32s)]
*  in good faith and negotiating a peace agreement. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=214.51999999999998s)]
*  And only by standing up to Putin, only by doubling down on our support for Ukraine, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=217.45999999999998s)]
*  is there any hope of a just peace in the ongoing war of aggression in eastern Ukraine. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=223.04s)]
*  President Trump famously said to President Zelensky, you have no cards in their appalling [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=229.92s)]
*  meeting in the Oval Office. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=235.84s)]
*  That's because President Trump started these negotiations by handing his cards away, by [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=237.72s)]
*  saying he would not support NATO membership, by saying he would recognize Crimea and would [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=243.12s)]
*  not push back on Russian occupation of the Ukrainian lands they've taken by force. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=248.44s)]
*  In a nation where our modern history was built on the sacrifice and bravery of millions of [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=254.8s)]
*  American troops who fought in Europe in World War II, this has rolled back our place in [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=260.04s)]
*  the world. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=265.76s)]
*  There is still time for Trump and Vance to see this clearly, and Senator Graham is moving [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=266.8s)]
*  a sanctions bill here in the Senate that now has, I believe, more than 70 cosponsors [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=273.36s)]
*  that would impose really brutal sanctions, secondary sanctions on Russia if they begin [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=279.24s)]
*  again their aggression after a peace deal. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=285.32s)]
*  But this is going to take presidential leadership to resolve and to get a just peace. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=288.64s)]
*  And so far, it doesn't seem to me that our president has woken up to the fact that Putin's [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=293.48s)]
*  been playing him all along. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=298.02000000000004s)]
*  We should note that Vladimir Putin today in Moscow is standing with Chinese President [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=300.16s)]
*  Xi Jinping. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=304.36s)]
*  Senator, elsewhere on the globe, we want to talk to you about the Middle East. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=305.36s)]
*  President Trump will actually be doing his first foreign trip of this term next week, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=309.64000000000004s)]
*  starting in Saudi Arabia, going to a couple other Gulf states while there. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=314.32000000000005s)]
*  Talk to us, please, about what he will face while there. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=318.76000000000005s)]
*  Your concerns in particular about negotiations with Iran, the tax in Yemen on the Houthis, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=322.96000000000004s)]
*  and what's happening in Gaza. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=330.16s)]
*  Well, first, there was a positive development in that there was the announcement of an agreement [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=332.12s)]
*  between the United States and the Houthis to stop striking each other, the Houthis to [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=337.76s)]
*  stop striking ships in the Red Sea and the United States to stop bombing them. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=342.12s)]
*  It was jarring that President Trump recognized the bravery of the Houthis. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=348.48s)]
*  That would be like him recognizing the bravery of Hamas. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=353.32s)]
*  There is an unfolding humanitarian disaster in Gaza because of a full stop of any humanitarian [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=357.52s)]
*  aid getting in. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=364.76s)]
*  When President Trump came into office, there was real positive movement in Gaza. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=366.52s)]
*  There was a ceasefire in place. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=371.71999999999997s)]
*  There were dozens of hostages released, and there was robust humanitarian aid getting [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=373.38s)]
*  in to address the suffering of two million Gazans. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=378.44s)]
*  That's changed. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=382.44s)]
*  In the last few months, the war has restarted. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=383.56s)]
*  Israel has blockaded Gaza from humanitarian aid, and the Saudis have made it perfectly [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=387.0s)]
*  clear. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=392.56s)]
*  They will not move forward with recognizing Israel with normalization without progress [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=393.56s)]
*  on the Palestinians, without a path towards self-governance, without reopening humanitarian [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=398.8s)]
*  relief. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=404.76s)]
*  Trump has an enormous opening here, an opportunity to show real leadership on the world stage [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=405.76s)]
*  by pressing Netanyahu to abandon the idea of occupying Gaza fully, to abandon the idea [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=411.2s)]
*  of displacing Palestinians, and to restart vetted humanitarian aid into Gaza. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=418.0s)]
*  This is a consequential trip. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=425.0s)]
*  If instead he fully embraces further occupation of Gaza and no humanitarian aid, I think he'll [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=427.15999999999997s)]
*  find his meetings in Saudi Arabia difficult. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=434.56s)]
*  The World Central Kitchen, a not-for-profit food relief charity which had been providing [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=438.79999999999995s)]
*  meals in the enclave since the war broke out, announced yesterday that it is shutting down [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=443.4s)]
*  meal-making operations in that territory due to a lack of supplies. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=447.88s)]
*  Israel's blockade of aid entering into Gaza has been in effect since early March. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=452.64s)]
*  The World Central Kitchen says it will continue to help Palestinian families in Gaza by aiding [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=456.88s)]
*  in water distribution, but it won't be able to help with food going forward until Israel [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=460.79999999999995s)]
*  allows aid to enter in the territory. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=466.04s)]
*  And lastly, Senator, one of your committees, the Appropriations Committee, just moments [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=469.48s)]
*  from now, FBI Director Cash Patel will testify there as the Trump administration seeks to [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=473.44s)]
*  cut over $500 million from the Bureau. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=478.68s)]
*  Senator Coons, you of course will be in that hearing. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=482.28s)]
*  What do you hope to find out here? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=485.0s)]
*  What are going to be some of your and your colleagues' questions for the FBI director? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=486.0s)]
*  Well, President Trump and Doge, while it was being led by Elon Musk, imposed cuts on hundreds [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=490.36s)]
*  of state and local law enforcement agencies around our country, cancelled I think 350 [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=497.15999999999997s)]
*  grants that were going to victims' assistance, to support for anti-violence initiatives, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=503.28s)]
*  support for police officers. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=509.48s)]
*  And now in his budget proposal, President Trump is calling for a $500 million cut to [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=511.68s)]
*  the FBI. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=517.8s)]
*  And we will be pressing FBI Director Cash Patel on how he will implement these cuts, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=518.8s)]
*  how this is anything other than directly defunding the police, and how this will help in the [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=524.76s)]
*  fight against violent crime, against counterterrorism, and the important work that the FBI does across [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=530.68s)]
*  our country. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=537.88s)]
*  There's also been some disturbing movement in the direction of firing those who had a [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=539.04s)]
*  hand in the January 6 investigations. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=543.88s)]
*  I'll remind you, one of the most disturbing things President Trump's done from a law enforcement [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=547.6s)]
*  perspective was to pardon all of the January 6 rioters, including those who viciously [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwvvhj6lkRw&t=552.36s)]
