# Musk urges lawmakers to ‘kill the bill’, but Republicans aren't walking away
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM)
*  The Wall Street Journal, meanwhile, this morning has some new reporting on that fraying relationship [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=0.0s)]
*  between two of the world's most powerful men, maybe the world's two most powerful men. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=4.76s)]
*  According to that reporting, President Trump is losing patience with Elon Musk's outburst [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=8.92s)]
*  over the last couple of days over this bill. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=13.52s)]
*  A senior White House official said Trump was not happy about Musk's decision to lambast [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=15.76s)]
*  his signature legislation, describing the president as confused as to why the Tesla [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=20.0s)]
*  chief executive decided to ratchet up his criticism after working so closely with the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=25.28s)]
*  president for four months. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=30.12s)]
*  The official said senior Trump advisors were caught off guard by Trump's latest offensive. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=31.92s)]
*  The piece continues, quote, Congressman Thomas Massey, one of the two House Republicans who [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=37.64s)]
*  voted against the bill in the House last month, was pleased Musk is speaking out. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=41.96s)]
*  I figured he would eventually get there, said Massey, who noted the two have not spoken [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=46.56s)]
*  on the issue. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=50.38s)]
*  You don't land rockets backwards or get cars to drive themselves by ignoring the people [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=51.38s)]
*  who are lying to you. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=56.620000000000005s)]
*  End quote. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=58.5s)]
*  Let's bring in Bloomberg columnist and senior writer for The Dispatch, David Drucker, and [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=59.5s)]
*  NBC News congressional correspondent Julie Serkin. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=64.18s)]
*  Good morning to you both. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=67.42s)]
*  Julie, let's talk about that back and forth on Capitol Hill. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=68.42s)]
*  We just heard Speaker Johnson doing his best to say that Elon Musk is wrong about this [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=70.74000000000001s)]
*  bill despite all the data we've just talked about, despite what the CBO has come out and [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=76.42s)]
*  said about adding $2.4 trillion to the debt over a decade. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=80.3s)]
*  Where does this play out from here? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=85.62s)]
*  You have conservatives, Republicans who are trying to please effectively Donald Trump [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=87.3s)]
*  on the one hand and Elon Musk on the other. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=91.89999999999999s)]
*  Well, I don't think unless Elon Musk, Willie, promises to fund challengers, primary challengers, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=94.53999999999999s)]
*  or even Democrats, which is a concern for Republicans in the White House, that Republicans [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=101.14s)]
*  on the Hill are going to pay attention to him, at least the ones who want to pass this [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=105.28s)]
*  bill. Right. I think that's the distinction here, because I think what Elon Musk illustrated [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=109.38s)]
*  yesterday or helped us understand was the Republicans who are going to vote for this [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=113.38s)]
*  no matter what and are just making noise like Senator Josh Hawley, who has a big issue with [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=117.02s)]
*  the Medicaid cuts and reforms because he of course represents a rural constituency in [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=121.5s)]
*  Missouri or Senator Rand Paul, Senator Johnson, who have been talking about the deficit and [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=126.14s)]
*  are echoing perhaps what Elon Musk has been saying online. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=131.68s)]
*  For Josh Hawley, for example, yesterday, he told me this is Donald Trump's administration, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=134.74s)]
*  Trump drives the train. He does not think that Elon Musk is going to have influence [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=139.18s)]
*  to kill this bill. But one very important through line in all of this is, yes, it's [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=143.62s)]
*  about the deficit. Yes, Elon Musk, of course, helped the president run a campaign that was [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=147.78s)]
*  all about cutting the debt. And now this bill, as you point out, will add to it. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=152.78s)]
*  But it's also about the electric vehicle tax credits that were removed as a part of this [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=157.14000000000001s)]
*  bill. That's very important for Elon Musk and his business. In fact, a couple of months [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=163.14000000000001s)]
*  ago, he said he doesn't need those tax credits because his business was doing so well. Of [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=168.26s)]
*  course, now that's not the case for Tesla. And we have new reporting that Elon Musk actually [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=172.46s)]
*  spent the last few weeks trying to lobby Speaker Mike Johnson, who is the only member of leadership, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=177.46s)]
*  Republican leadership, that he has that kind of relationship where he can call and text [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=183.18s)]
*  to keep those credits alive, to not put them in this bill. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=187.26s)]
*  By the way, another thing in this bill, people who drive electric vehicles are now going [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=191.1s)]
*  to have to start contributing to the Highway Trust Fund. So a lot of changes made in this [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=194.82s)]
*  legislation that would hurt Elon Musk's bottom line. And a lot of people I'm talking to think [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=199.38s)]
*  that's exactly why he's making noise right now. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=203.94s)]
*  Well, and David Drucker, of course, also the NASA administrator issue came up there. So [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=207.14s)]
*  no doubt there are a lot of reasons for the bottom line for Elon Musk, for him to be upset [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=212.66s)]
*  right now. And perhaps that has something to do with all of this. Perhaps it has a lot [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=217.66s)]
*  to do with all of this. But I'm just curious in your reporting, forgive me for being naive here. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=221.78s)]
*  This bill, if this were put in front of us by Newt Gingrich or anybody else's speaker, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=233.22s)]
*  we would have laughed it off the floor. And the last thing you would want would be for [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=241.94s)]
*  somebody supporting this bill to do what Donald Trump did yesterday and say, oh, I agree with [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=249.94s)]
*  Elizabeth Warren, we should get rid of the debt ceiling forever. We go, aha, okay, there's [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=254.42s)]
*  your evidence, right? But I just, I'm incapable of understanding how somebody who calls themselves [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=260.94s)]
*  a fiscal conservative could vote for this bill, the size of it, would be a deal killer. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=269.94s)]
*  In the first place, the added $2.4 trillion in debt on top of $20 trillion in the next [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=277.94s)]
*  10 years on top of $37 trillion. I mean, I could go on and on, on and on and on about [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=285.06s)]
*  this. But David, is there, I don't understand why there's not a level of unease from a lot [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=291.34s)]
*  of people that I served with that are still there to pass what looks like to me the most [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=298.14s)]
*  fiscally irresponsible bill in American history? Yeah, well, listen, Joe, as you know, lawmakers [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=306.14s)]
*  don't like to push boulders uphill. They only like, excuse me, they only like to push them [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=314.14s)]
*  downhill. And the people you served with are now in a Republican party where populists [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=317.94s)]
*  are ascendant and fiscal conservatives, really the traditional conservative that we like [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=324.06s)]
*  to think of from the Reagan era is a minority within the coalition. And so there just isn't [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=330.14s)]
*  a lot of support for the kind of fiscal restraint that used to sort of characterize the Republican [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=336.5s)]
*  party at least philosophically. But David, are there not four or five in the House? And [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=343.74s)]
*  this isn't even fiscal restraint. This is just like not jumping off a cliff fiscally. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=348.86s)]
*  Yeah, well, I mean- There aren't four or five conservative Republicans left in the House [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=354.34000000000003s)]
*  that say no to this? Well, yeah, but saying it's not saying no to this. It's saying no [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=359.02s)]
*  to President Donald Trump and their voters trust Trump more than they trust them. So [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=363.53999999999996s)]
*  as long as Trump wants this bill, this bill is likely to pass one way or the other. Now [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=369.5s)]
*  I've talked to Republican strategists about this and this is the point I want to make [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=375.09999999999997s)]
*  is that Republicans with their thin majorities in the House and Senate really aren't doing [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=379.53999999999996s)]
*  much else. Every ounce of energy they have, most of the legislation that they might pass [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=384.94s)]
*  is all rolled up into this reconciliation package. That includes a lot of the tax cuts [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=391.42s)]
*  for middle and lower class voters that the president campaigned on. That also includes [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=396.24s)]
*  a lot of the border security components that are broadly popular that he campaigned on. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=400.62s)]
*  And so if this thing collapses, the entire Trump agenda collapses, that which he can't [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=405.38s)]
*  do by executive order, and the entire congressional Republican agenda collapses, they risk going [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=411.5s)]
*  to the voters empty handed next year. That's a recipe for disaster. One other thing here, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=417.22s)]
*  and Republicans have told me that if they were to start from scratch and do this in [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=422.52s)]
*  a way that wasn't going to add to the debt, that would require actual normal legislating [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=427.2s)]
*  and they'd have to negotiate with Democrats, at least in the Senate where Democrats can [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=433.34s)]
*  And the Republican base would look at that as a complete failure and be really, really upset [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=439.02s)]
*  that they weren't just plowing this stuff through. So there are a lot of political considerations [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=444.18s)]
*  that are not surprisingly are looming larger in the minds of these Republicans than the [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=448.88s)]
*  fiscal considerations because no voter, finally here, no voter's beating on their door complaining [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=454.09999999999997s)]
*  about the debt. They're just not. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=459.62s)]
*  Yeah, well, they will be. They will be. Willie, you know, it's amazing that one of the arguments [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=462.58s)]
*  for not going back and doing this right is you would have to actually go through regular [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=474.53999999999996s)]
*  order. You would have to actually go to committees. You would actually have to start at subcommittees, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=482.02s)]
*  go to committees, go to the House floor instead of the House speaker and one or two other [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=487.82s)]
*  people writing this bill behind closed doors that nobody sees, nobody reads. And after [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=492.94s)]
*  it's out there, you have members being shocked going, Oh my gosh, I didn't know that was [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=499.0s)]
*  in there. That's what happens when you say, Oh, we're not going to go through regular [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=502.98s)]
*  order because we want to jam a lot of BS in here that nobody's going to read. You know, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=507.02s)]
*  when they find out about that, they find out about that about two weeks into their campaign [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=512.02s)]
*  because I guarantee you they may not have read the bill, but their opponents and the [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=516.22s)]
*  DNC will have read the bill and everything they're voting yes on, they're going to pay [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=522.74s)]
*  for politically every single thing. And we're seeing that from members already in the House [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=528.38s)]
*  who voted for the bill. And now after the fact, you're hearing exactly what you're laying [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=534.0600000000001s)]
*  out, which is people saying, wait a minute, the bill, this massive bill includes this. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=538.5s)]
*  Oh, well, I didn't like that. I guess I should have fully read the bill. And they're going [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=543.2600000000001s)]
*  to hear more about that. As you say, if this makes it through from people in their districts [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=547.1800000000001s)]
*  whose hospitals are eliminated, who lost health care because of this and Julie Serkin, maybe [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=551.2600000000001s)]
*  people don't care in the abstract about the debt. Maybe that's not something that motivates [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=557.1800000000001s)]
*  them and brings them out to polls. But if you take away their health care, as this bill, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=561.62s)]
*  according to the CBO does to 11 million people, they sure notice that and they know who voted [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=565.46s)]
*  for it and why they lost their health care. So, you know, if history is our guide, Republicans [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=570.42s)]
*  do not cross Donald Trump in the end. They raise protests and they say they don't like [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=576.14s)]
*  something but they eventually fall in line. Do you suspect based on your reporting on [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=579.86s)]
*  Capitol Hill, that's what's going to happen here? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=584.14s)]
*  Absolutely. They are not going to back away from this bill because Elon Musk told them [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=586.62s)]
*  so. And it's a shift because a couple of months ago, everything that Elon Musk would put on [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=590.9399999999999s)]
*  scare Republicans in Congress. But that was because he had the backing of the president, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=596.06s)]
*  right? There's no pressure. David's absolutely right. Like the one that can come across Pennsylvania [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=601.02s)]
*  Avenue on Capitol Hill from Trump. And I think it's an important point that they have not [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=605.2199999999999s)]
*  done much legislatively in the House. At this point in 2017, at least the House already [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=611.14s)]
*  passed the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Of course, it was blocked in the Senate, but [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=617.14s)]
*  for Republicans, they had a win on that issue. Now, of course, as you point out, Americans [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=620.78s)]
*  being kicked off their health care is not a win politically, but at least they were [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=625.18s)]
*  able to show their base that they did something that the president ultimately ran on. Of course, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=629.1s)]
*  they weren't successful. But in this case, you really have a House that has not accomplished [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=633.9s)]
*  much. And remember, the reason it was put in this one big, beautiful bill is because [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=638.02s)]
*  there are such fragile majorities. You really, the only way that you can get all of this [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=642.4599999999999s)]
*  through to fund the president's agenda, the border, the military, the energy, all of these [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=646.54s)]
*  things that he ran on that he now wants Congress to make do on is by stuffing it all together [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=650.06s)]
*  and force people to swallow the things they don't like in addition to the things that [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=655.2199999999999s)]
*  they might like. And so now you have a situation, of course, where the House passed a bill that [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=658.9799999999999s)]
*  is probably going to get torn up by the Senate at least a little bit. There's no way they [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=663.3s)]
*  can send back even close to the same product because you have those moderates in the Senate. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=667.14s)]
*  Even Josh Hawley, of course, is not a moderate, but they know what's at stake if they take [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=672.5s)]
*  away Medicaid from millions of people. They know that they are going to lose in the midterms [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=677.0200000000001s)]
*  in 2026. Trump might not be worried about that because he can say that historically [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=681.5s)]
*  that's what happens. The party in charge loses in the midterm elections. But the senators [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=685.94s)]
*  who are in their seats right now are worried about that. And you have to think about the [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=690.6600000000001s)]
*  Republicans in the House just quickly here who voted for things that the Senate is going [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=694.9000000000001s)]
*  to change. And now their primary opponents, Democrats, are going to still be able to run [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=699.58s)]
*  on that and throw that in their faces in 2026. So this is a huge problem for them. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=704.7s)]
*  Trump is not ideological in any way, as we know. He doesn't really care about that. He's [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=710.0200000000001s)]
*  going to make deals with whoever he needs to, even if it's Democrats at the end of the [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=714.26s)]
*  day. So that's so important to point out. There's so many House Republicans, and this [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=718.1s)]
*  goes way back. There's an old saying that a lot of people watching may not remember, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=724.58s)]
*  but there was an old saying you would go around when they were trying to get you as a member [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=731.7s)]
*  of the House to vote for something that the Senate would never vote for. You'd say, I'm [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=735.1800000000001s)]
*  not going to be BTU'd, which was Bill Clinton passed a bill that had a BTU tax that House [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=739.1800000000001s)]
*  members fought against but ended up voting for. And then it got stripped out of the Senate [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=748.26s)]
*  bill. So they voted for nothing, but every one of them had to defend that on the campaign [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=754.0600000000001s)]
*  trail. Why did you vote for an increase in energy tax? Why did you vote for this? Why [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=759.58s)]
*  did you vote for that? I'm sitting here most likely because a conservative Democrat who [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=763.74s)]
*  is in leadership voted to get the bill over to the Senate, and then after he saw what [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=770.1800000000001s)]
*  was happening, he said, I don't need this. I'm not going to be defending this on the [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=776.5400000000001s)]
*  campaign trail every day. And that's, of course, this is important. That's the reason why Republicans [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=780.58s)]
*  took the majority for the first time in 40 years because of a terrible bill, a terrible [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=787.02s)]
*  budget bill. And so this is a game changer, Mika. When you have somebody like Josh Hawley, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=795.78s)]
*  he's looking at it, he's thinking, am I really going to take away health care from the reddest [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=803.38s)]
*  parts of my state so Silicon Valley monopolists and Silicon Valley billionaires can get an [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=810.78s)]
*  even bigger tax cut? Like, that's a game changer for any Democrat that's running. If you have [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=819.42s)]
*  a Republican willing to do that, that's fine. And by the way, the whole thing, oh, we had [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=827.7s)]
*  to vote for it because it was an up or down, but no, no, no. Why don't you legislate? Why [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=831.46s)]
*  don't you do your job? Why don't you go through subcommittees? Why don't you go through committees? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=836.78s)]
*  Why don't you do it the way Congress had done it for like 220 years where you actually go [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=841.76s)]
*  to Capitol Hill and work? You actually go to Capitol Hill and legislate. You actually [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=849.14s)]
*  don't let the Speaker of the House and the Majority Leader and a couple of lobbyists [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=853.4599999999999s)]
*  sit behind closed doors, locked closed doors where 430 members are locked out of the House [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=858.14s)]
*  and the Senate. Think about that. They lock out like 430 members from this process and [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=866.78s)]
*  two, three, four people write this bill. Yeah, go try selling that on the campaign trail [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=872.78s)]
*  and say, oh, I couldn't really do anything. It was an up or down vote. Yeah, it was an [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=881.22s)]
*  up or down vote because you're allowing it to be an up or down vote. You're adding trillions [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=884.5799999999999s)]
*  to the debt because you're deciding you don't want to do your job. It's too hard. It's too [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=890.1s)]
*  hard to be a subcommittee member or a committee member and actually take this through the [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=894.44s)]
*  process. Too hard. So it's an up or down vote. It's ridiculous. It's a beautiful bill. It [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=900.72s)]
*  has some ugly consequences. We'll see what happens. NBC's Julie Serkin, thank you so [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=906.5200000000001s)]
*  much for your reporting this morning and still ahead. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGfpaZVSMHM&t=911.0s)]
