# U.S. GDP declines 0.3 percent as imports surged ahead of Trump's tariffs
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg)
*  That is basically down. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=0.0s)]
*  And interest rates came down, despite the fact that I have a Fed person who's not really [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=2.48s)]
*  doing a good job. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=7.5s)]
*  But I won't say that. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=8.56s)]
*  I want to be very nice. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=9.94s)]
*  I want to be very nice and respectful to the Fed. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=11.46s)]
*  You're not supposed to criticize the Fed. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=15.9s)]
*  You're supposed to let him do his own thing. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=17.64s)]
*  But I know much more than he does about interest rates, believe me. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=19.32s)]
*  Ah, that was President Trump last night in Michigan, marking 100 days in office with [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=22.44s)]
*  a campaign-style speech. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=28.12s)]
*  Welcome to the fourth hour of Morning Joe, along with Jonathan Lamire and me at 6 a.m. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=30.32s)]
*  on the West Coast, 9 a.m. in the East. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=34.84s)]
*  So why don't we get right to the latest economic news. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=37.04s)]
*  The U.S. economy slowed sharply in the first quarter as GDP data for the first three months [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=40.52s)]
*  of the year showed a contraction of 0.3 percent. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=48.040000000000006s)]
*  This is Jonathan, the first quarter of negative GDP growth since the first quarter of 2022. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=52.72s)]
*  Yeah, much closer to the height of the pandemic than also we've seen imports surging into [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=59.2s)]
*  the country here because manufacturers businesses preparing for the impact of President Trump's [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=63.96s)]
*  tariffs. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=69.84s)]
*  Not news that a White House would like. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=71.2s)]
*  And for more, let's go into CNBC's Dom Chiu. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=72.8s)]
*  Dom, give us your read here. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=76.64s)]
*  So sure. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=78.6s)]
*  So, the gross domestic product data is hard economic data, right? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=79.6s)]
*  This is data that has happened in the past that is actually measurable. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=83.28s)]
*  So that latest read on growth came in lower than expected as well. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=87.19999999999999s)]
*  The three-tenths of a percent drop on an annualized basis compares to what economists were looking [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  for in terms of growth of four-tenths of a percent. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=96.44s)]
*  Now this is the first read on first quarter GDP. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=99.84s)]
*  We're going to get two more revisions to get to the final number weeks from now. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=103.17999999999999s)]
*  So markets are lower in part, as you point out, due to the GDP number. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=108.22s)]
*  But some traders and investors are being a little bit more measured about the surprise [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=111.78s)]
*  drop in that GDP because, to Jonathan's point, a good amount of it is due to the surge in [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=115.34s)]
*  imports as many companies, even consumers, rush to get goods into the country ahead of [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=121.08s)]
*  those tariffs being implemented. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=126.62s)]
*  Imports just as a primer, they actually subtract from gross domestic product. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=129.06s)]
*  So that drop could actually be reversed at some point in the coming months, depending [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=133.28s)]
*  on the kind of import and other economic activity we had. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=137.68s)]
*  And by the way, we also got more hard economic data from data from payrolls processor ADP, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=140.9s)]
*  which showed that America added 62,000 private sector jobs during the month of April. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=147.3s)]
*  That was well below the 120,000 jobs expected by economists and lower than the 147,000 that [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=152.0s)]
*  we saw back in March. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=159.5s)]
*  Now when it comes to the softer economic data, which is consumer confidence, other survey-related [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=161.04s)]
*  data, that's taken a hit as well. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=166.82s)]
*  According to the most recent survey from the Conference Board, the consumer confidence [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=168.82s)]
*  index fell by nearly eight points to a level of 86. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=172.17999999999998s)]
*  Now that's significant because it would make it the lowest read on consumer confidence [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=174.85999999999999s)]
*  since May of 2020. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=179.14s)]
*  That was around the depths of the COVID pandemic, the shutdown of the economy around the world, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=181.14s)]
*  including ours. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=185.98s)]
*  Confidence is really, though, taking a hit in what Americans expect in the next six months. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=187.56s)]
*  The Conference Board's Expectations Index, which asks respondents about how they feel [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=192.84s)]
*  about the next half year, that measure fell to the lowest since October of 2011, and it [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=198.26s)]
*  was driven by sharp drops in optimism over all three of the expectations components. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=204.8s)]
*  We're talking business conditions, employment prospects, and future income as well. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=210.16s)]
*  And then I just want to end here by giving you a bigger part of the spectrum. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=215.56s)]
*  We talked about the consumer. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=219.0s)]
*  Now it's about the business side of things. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=220.68s)]
*  This is the busiest week of corporate earnings season. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=222.6s)]
*  About a third of the entire large cap S&P 500 will report their latest quarterly financial [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=225.72s)]
*  results. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=231.32s)]
*  One of the bigger themes that we've seen so far this season is the number of companies [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=232.32s)]
*  who've lowered their expectations and forecasts for future business activity or outright withdrawn [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=237.07999999999998s)]
*  their forecasts overall, citing the uncertainty hanging over them on the global economic front [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=243.64s)]
*  because of things like tariff policy. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=249.64s)]
*  One of the more recent examples is Stellantis, which is the Europe-based parent company of [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=251.72s)]
*  car brands like Dodge, Jeep, Maserati, Chrysler, others. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=255.64s)]
*  It abandoned its full year forecast due to tariff related uncertainties, but it did say [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=259.44s)]
*  it is highly engaged with the administration on tariff policies in the future. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=264.84s)]
*  Also airline companies like American, Alaska, Southwest Airlines, all either withdrew fully [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=269.7s)]
*  or part of their full year forecast, given the uncertainty leading to some questions [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=275.32s)]
*  about consumer and business travel in the coming months. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=279.86s)]
*  But it's not all bad news because I'm not all that bad news guy. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=283.2s)]
*  Guys, Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines, Royal Caribbean, did manage to raise its full year [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=287.48s)]
*  forecast. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=293.54s)]
*  The company is saying that bookings for the full year remain on track. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=294.54s)]
*  Cancellations are at nominal levels and that they are seeing business activity consistent [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=298.06s)]
*  with their prior forecast. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=303.22s)]
*  So they're upping that as well. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=304.82s)]
*  more mixed, but still the general feeling is that there is a slowdown that is occurring, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=307.04s)]
*  whether or not it leads to a full recession. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=312.16s)]
*  That's going to be the key question for a lot of people out there. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=314.96000000000004s)]
*  Covering a lot of ground for us there are thanks to CNBC's Dom Chu, AKA all not bad [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=317.16s)]
*  news guy. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=322.56s)]
*  Dom, thank you so much. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=323.56s)]
*  Let's now bring in bad news guy, managing editor of the bulwark Sam Stein, president [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=325.36s)]
*  and CEO of the LBJ Foundation, presidential historian Mark Updegrove, and co-founder [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=330.28000000000003s)]
*  and CEO of All In Together, Lauren Leader. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=336.24s)]
*  Lauren here at the table with us. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=338.03999999999996s)]
*  Thanks to you all for joining. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=339.59999999999997s)]
*  Sam, we will go with you to start. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=341.2s)]
*  We've seen a series actually of a sort of worrisome economic data points in the last [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=344.59999999999997s)]
*  week or two that show concerns about the economy now, but more that as Dom just said, really [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=350.24s)]
*  reflecting worries about what's coming. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=356.4s)]
*  The full on impact of this trade war of President Trump's tariffs. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=359.28s)]
*  He spent a lot of time last night in Michigan trying to explain to his audience why they [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=365.15999999999997s)]
*  would eventually help. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=368.23999999999995s)]
*  He seems to be sort of in a minority position on that. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=370.28s)]
*  Give us your read on this situation and the pretty complicated and worrisome politics [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=373.56s)]
*  for this White House. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=377.88s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the GDP number is not great, but it's not as Dom says, it's not terrible [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=378.88s)]
*  because if you look underneath, consumer spending is fine. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=384.59999999999997s)]
*  Job growth from last month was fine, pretty good actually. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=388.08s)]
*  What's really happening is a psychological warfare on the consumer and the business that's [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=391.76000000000005s)]
*  being waged by this White House. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=395.20000000000005s)]
*  And anticipation of these tariffs, you're seeing a massive spike in imports. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=397.16s)]
*  And really the number that's worrisome is consumer confidence, right? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=401.64000000000004s)]
*  People are just not feeling good about this economy. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=404.36s)]
*  They're probably preparing to spend less, earn less, and that can have profound economic [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=406.84000000000003s)]
*  ripple effects. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=411.64000000000004s)]
*  So, you know, it's like we're in this weird position in which the president's kind of [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=412.64000000000004s)]
*  holding a gun to the economy, threatening to shoot it. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=417.52000000000004s)]
*  We don't know if he's going to do it and everyone's getting prepared for the shot [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=420.68s)]
*  to be fired. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=423.2s)]
*  Now, I will just add one thing. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=424.2s)]
*  This quarter was not the quarter where people were expecting bad numbers. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=426.96s)]
*  It's the next quarter when the tariffs do kick in, if they do kick in, I should say. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=430.52s)]
*  And already that ADP number about job growth coming in well below expectations, I mean, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=434.72s)]
*  that's, if you're the White House, you're sitting there, you're looking at those numbers, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=439.44s)]
*  you're like, this is not looking particularly great. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=442.2s)]
*  We're going to start seeing the impact of the tariffs actually in Q2. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=445.12s)]
*  We're going to start seeing the impact of the Doge job cuts soon in the April jobs data. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=448.04s)]
*  The real bad data is to come. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=454.56s)]
*  This is the mixed bad data. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=456.82s)]
*  And so if I'm the White House, I'm on the political side, I am not feeling particularly [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=458.68s)]
*  great about this. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=463.08000000000004s)]
*  And I'm probably trying to concoct some ways to get Trump to move more swiftly to announce [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=464.08000000000004s)]
*  some deals or really honestly pull the tariffs back entirely. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRJlgkpwDmg&t=469.8s)]
