# Steve Rattner: Debt soars under House bill, GOP tax cuts are massive
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY)
*  Bringing former Treasury official morning Joe economic analysts our good friends Steve Ratner over at the southwest wall Steve [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=0.0s)]
*  Good morning. Good to see you. Let's continue this conversation about the so-called big beautiful bill and its impact on the national debt [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=6.82s)]
*  What are you looking at there? Well, look, it's a really a big bill [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=13.44s)]
*  Well, it's beautiful not we can debate but as you heard before the challenge is that there are people who think it's too big [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=16.34s)]
*  There are people who think there's other stuff that should be cut and so it's a really tough situation for the president [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=22.02s)]
*  But let's take a look at what the bill as it was written in the house would actually do [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=27.8s)]
*  First of all, it's important to note that we're already as I think everybody knows starting with a really large deficit [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  Our deficit is almost two trillion dollars right now while it's projected go down slightly [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=37.88s)]
*  It would otherwise then keep climbing up to about between two and two and a half trillion dollars [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=42.44s)]
*  That's we do nothing the big beautiful bill [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  You can look at two ways as it is written it would do this [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=50.24s)]
*  So we have the budget deficit still higher than we have but there are a bunch of gimmicks in there in terms of making things [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=53.62s)]
*  Expire that aren't really gonna end up expiring [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=59.84s)]
*  And so I think the real way to look at this big beautiful bill is it would take the deficit out to three trillion dollars [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=62.22s)]
*  In 2035 and and that becomes a huge amount and then you see what it does to the debt [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=69.3s)]
*  So right now we're sitting here with 37 trillion dollars of debt [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=75.06s)]
*  Compared to a GDP the whole size of our economy is only 30 trillion meaning our debt is bigger than our economy [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=79.94s)]
*  That's the only the only other time this has happened was in World War two [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=86.58s)]
*  So we're starting with a huge debt load and then no matter really what you do because the deficit stays high [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=89.98s)]
*  No matter what you do [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=96.36s)]
*  The big beautiful bill makes it worse you and you could end up out here with 55 trillion dollars of debt [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=98.14s)]
*  So the debt growing faster than the economy this becomes unsustainable [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=104.72s)]
*  And this is what the deficit hawks are really focused on Steve [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=109.12s)]
*  Already bigger than the economy is the national debt and this would just add to that as you say [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=113.44000000000001s)]
*  This is a large conversation. I know but just briefly what are the risks to a debt that is larger than the economy [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=117.74000000000001s)]
*  Well what you're seeing what you've seen happen in the last few weeks as this bill has been moving through Congress is [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=124.4s)]
*  Periodic spurts of interest rates moving up the federal government has to sell this debt periodically it rolls over it matures [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=130.24s)]
*  They have to go out in the market and sell it and the risk is that we pay higher and higher [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=136.96s)]
*  Interest rates for our debt and that in turn as we'll look at in a few charts [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=141.32000000000002s)]
*  squeezes out other kinds of spending and puts an ordinary pressure on our debt and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=146.04000000000002s)]
*  Forces some really really unpleasant things at some point reversing tax cuts when the market says it's enough [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=150.32000000000002s)]
*  We're not going to keep financing these kinds of deficits. It's really a burden [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=156.10000000000002s)]
*  We're leaving to our children and our grandchildren and that is an incredibly selfish act that we're doing all right speaking of tax cuts [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=159.4s)]
*  Let's look to your second chart these are in your words [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=165.84s)]
*  Absolutely massive tax cuts dwarfing anything we saw from the first Trump administration. Yeah, so this bill again [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=169.12s)]
*  This there's a bunch of gimmicks in it. You can look at it as a two point four trillion dollar bill [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  You can look at it as a four trillion dollar increase to the deficit [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=181.0s)]
*  But but compared to all the stuff we've done in the last few years the bipartisan [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=184.56s)]
*  Infrastructure law looks puny compared to this the rescue plan half the size of this the cares Act which was Trump's [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=189.64s)]
*  COVID rescue plan one point seven trillion and here Trump's signature tax bill from his first administration [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=197.67999999999998s)]
*  the tax cut and jobs act [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  1.5 trillion so compared to his last tax cut we're talking about something that is massively different [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=206.6s)]
*  Why is it so big he wants to extend all the tax cuts that were set to expire in the last bill [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=213.07999999999998s)]
*  This was the gimmick in the last bill [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=218.67999999999998s)]
*  They use these gimmicks to make these bills look smaller because then they come back and extend the tax cut [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=220.35999999999999s)]
*  Increase the standard deduction increase the child tax cut and then these are a bunch of campaign promises that Trump made [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=225.84s)]
*  Sort of out of nowhere and in states and in places where it would be politically advantageous [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=232.64s)]
*  No tax on overtime no tax on car loan interest no tax on tips and so forth [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=237.35999999999999s)]
*  They want to increase defense spending [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=243.04s)]
*  He promised no taxes on Social Security for seniors [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=245.64s)]
*  You can't do that through this process [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=249.48s)]
*  but he came with up with a workaround to basically provide the same thing and then there are the cuts and [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=251.76s)]
*  This is what Elon Musk is on about rescinding the IRA climate funds [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=258.71999999999997s)]
*  This is the EV tax credit in here and these are the Medicaid cut 700 billion dollars, which have not only gotten [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=262.68s)]
*  criticism from Democrats [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=269.84s)]
*  But even Republicans like Josh Hawley a very conservative Republican has said this can't happen [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=271.68s)]
*  And so as we talked about in the last block [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=277.52s)]
*  You've got people on both sides of this pushing in different directions, which is going to make this unbelievably difficult [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=280.48s)]
*  To get through the Senate and then it has to go back to the house and be reconciled with the bill that they passed [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=286.44s)]
*  Did you say that last line Medicaid cuts is going to be a big problem? Let's go to your third chart [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=291.24s)]
*  You say debt is difficult to tame. What are you looking at there? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=295.96000000000004s)]
*  Well, why did Elon Musk fail so spectacularly he [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=299.88s)]
*  President had talked during the campaign about cutting two trillion [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=304.8s)]
*  Elon talked about cutting a trillion the final number is probably less than 150 billion [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  Maybe a hundred billion and by the way, yes people are dying because of that that's been now well documented [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=313.04s)]
*  But the reason it's so hard to cut is because so much of the budget is kind of off limits [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=318.8s)]
*  Nobody wants to cut Medicare nobody wants to cut Social Security. You can't cut interest obviously people want to increase defense [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=324.15999999999997s)]
*  Veterans benefits probably not food stamps [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=333.03999999999996s)]
*  Maybe a little bit something there and then of course you have the Medicaid piece down here [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=336.12s)]
*  But everything else that's left out of a seven trillion dollar budget is only about a trillion dollars [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=340.84s)]
*  You can't cut two trillion dollars out of a trillion dollars [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=346.23999999999995s)]
*  You can't cut a trillion dollars out of a trillion dollars [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=349.16s)]
*  And so that's why when when Doge got in there they found there really wasn't very much to do [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=351.56s)]
*  But let's just say a word of what could have been because we've now had 25 years of basic fiscal [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=357.56s)]
*  irresponsibility going back to the Bush tax cuts in [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=364.08000000000004s)]
*  2001 and so if we had not increased discretionary spending faster than the economy [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=367.20000000000005s)]
*  We would have been we could have increased it just not as fast as we did [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=372.44000000000005s)]
*  If we had not had all these tax bills the Bush tax cuts and then the TCGA and so forth [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=376.34000000000003s)]
*  The recession response you could say we really had to do but it costs a lot of money [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=381.62s)]
*  but in any event if we had not done this stuff, we still would have had a government that was growing and [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=386.06s)]
*  We would have ended up in [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=391.54s)]
*  2021 with essentially no debt. This was the missed opportunity [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=393.98s)]
*  Now because so much of the spending is constrained now because we're paying so much interest. It's impossible to do something like this [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=398.34000000000003s)]
*  Morning Joe economic analyst Steve Ratner. Thank you very much for being on this morning for those explanations [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDpAsVU6SiY&t=406.18s)]
