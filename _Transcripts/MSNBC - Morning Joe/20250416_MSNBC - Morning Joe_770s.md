# Judge scolds DOJ officials, tells them they have two weeks to prove they're not in contempt of court
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw)
*  U.S. District Judge Paula Zennis, who's overseeing Kilmar Abrego-Garcia's case, is now weighing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=0.0s)]
*  contempt proceedings against the Trump administration for failing to act in returning [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=6.88s)]
*  Abrego-Garcia back to the U.S. During a hearing yesterday, Zennis scolded Justice Department [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=12.64s)]
*  officials for doing nothing to facilitate Abrego-Garcia's release from El Salvador's [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=17.92s)]
*  notorious prison, telling them to cancel vacations and other appointments in order to comply with [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=23.44s)]
*  a two-week inquiry into the matter. She added there will be no tolerance for gamesmanship [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=29.92s)]
*  or grandstanding. In an eight-page written order, Zennis said four senior officials from Homeland [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=36.72s)]
*  Security and the State Department must sit for depositions by next Wednesday to produce details [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=43.040000000000006s)]
*  under oath about their attempts to bring him back. Zennis also called out the Trump administration [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  for its semantics over the word facilitate in its read of both her order and the Supreme Court's [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=57.12s)]
*  order. In a status report ahead of yesterday's hearing, a Trump administration attorney wrote [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=66.56s)]
*  that even if Abrego-Garcia does make it back to the U.S., the administration will only deport him [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=72.47999999999999s)]
*  again. For his part, President Trump continues to argue he won the decision, nine to nothing, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=79.28s)]
*  and that the matter is entirely in the hands of El Salvador. Let's bring in NBC News justice [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=86.16s)]
*  and intelligence correspondent Ken Delaney. And Ken, what do you make of the order here? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=92.64s)]
*  And what it appears this judge, I'm assuming even the press conference that the president had with [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=97.84s)]
*  the president of El Salvador where the entire cabinet chimed in, probably not helpful. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=107.12s)]
*  Ken Delaney, New York Times, New York Times, New York Times, New York Times, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=112.16000000000001s)]
*  Good morning, Nika. Good morning, Joe. No, in fact, the judge said that she disregarded [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=113.36000000000001s)]
*  that news conference. She didn't believe that that was evidence of really anything. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=117.84s)]
*  But I think one of the real takeaways from this whole saga so far is that there's no evidence that [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=122.64000000000001s)]
*  anyone from the Trump administration, the president or anyone else, has even asked El Salvador to [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=128.72s)]
*  return this man. So when you talk about the definition of the word facilitate, the lawyer [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=134.16s)]
*  for the Trump administration in that hearing yesterday said that they believe that facilitate [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=138.96s)]
*  is if he presents himself at a port of entry, they will facilitate his admission back to the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=143.12s)]
*  United States, where they will, of course, try to deport him again, as you mentioned. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=148.48000000000002s)]
*  But the judge was not having this. She was very frustrated, obviously. It's been very clear to her [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  and other observers and the lawyer for Mr. Arbrego Garcia that the Trump administration has been [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  resisting. They have not done a single thing to try to get this guy back from El Salvador. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=163.52s)]
*  And you're right, Joe, that Supreme Court ruling does give them a little wiggle room here [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=169.04000000000002s)]
*  because they apparently don't feel like they can bind the executive branch in any way in terms of [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=174.72s)]
*  their relations with another country. But it's clear that the courts have said this man was [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=179.68s)]
*  wrongly deported. And yet again, the administration has not asked for him back. They've not made that [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=184.56s)]
*  simple request. And so you're right, Mika, what this judge appears to be doing here with this [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=190.32s)]
*  inquiry and putting people under oath is setting the stage for a potential contempt order. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=196.4s)]
*  Now, we've seen those in the past. Executive branch officials have been held in contempt. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  The Interior Secretary was at one point over handling of some Native American trusts. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=206.23999999999998s)]
*  And generally, that's a symbolic act because to the extent that the judge issues fines, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=211.92s)]
*  the federal government can pay endless amounts of fines. But in this case, you really wonder how far [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=217.6s)]
*  this judge will be willing to go to enforce her order in the face of resistance and recalcitrance [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=222.16s)]
*  from these executive branch officials. Would she order someone placed in jail? And then the next [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=228.0s)]
*  question is, who enforces that order? Is it the U.S. Marshals? Well, they work for the attorney [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=233.35999999999999s)]
*  general. So would the attorney general tell them not to carry out that order, even though it's a [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=237.76s)]
*  lawful order from a court? And then if that happens, could the court appoint someone else [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=241.76s)]
*  with a badge and a gun to enforce that kind of court order? It really raises some uncomfortable [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=247.6s)]
*  questions. But that's what happens when an administration appears to defy the courts, guys. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=252.95999999999998s)]
*  Well, it raises uncomfortable questions. Again, the Supreme Court also. It's not just this federal [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=258.08s)]
*  judge, this district judge that's looking at what the Trump administration is doing and what they [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=263.59999999999997s)]
*  did inside the White House and what they did with the president of El Salvador yesterday. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=267.76s)]
*  You've got nine justices on the Supreme Court who are looking to. And as the Wall Street Journal [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=272.24s)]
*  editorial board writes about the case, they're not pleased. Mr. Abreu Garcia is being held under [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=279.92s)]
*  an agreement in which the administration is paying El Salvador $6 million to house migrants this year. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=286.0s)]
*  Since the Supreme Court has ordered efforts to facilitate the return, continuing to pay El Salvador [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=292.0s)]
*  for his detention would violate that order, writes the Wall Street Journal editorial page. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=297.2s)]
*  The larger problem is that Mr. Abreu Garcia was deported without due process, writes Murdoch's [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=303.59999999999997s)]
*  Wall Street Journal editorial page. Mr. Trump would be wise to settle all of this by quietly [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=311.03999999999996s)]
*  asking Mr. Bukele to return Mr. Garcia, who has a family in the U.S. But the president may be [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=317.36s)]
*  bloody-minded enough that he wants to show the judiciary who's boss. If this case does become a [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=324.0s)]
*  judicial showdown, Mr. Trump may assert his Article 2 powers not to return Mr. Abreu Garcia, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=330.48s)]
*  and the Supreme Court will be reluctant to disagree. But Mr. Trump would be smarter to play [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=336.4s)]
*  the long game. He has many much bigger issues than the fate of one man that will come before [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=342.24s)]
*  the Supreme Court. By taunting the judiciary in this manner, he is inviting a rebuke on cases [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=348.0s)]
*  that carry far greater stakes. And again, this is, again, going back to Signalgate, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=355.28s)]
*  this could be an example of the administration fighting to win a battle and ending up losing [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=362.48s)]
*  a political war, a kindlingian. I'm reminded back in 2017 when Donald Trump started attacking federal [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=369.44s)]
*  judges on Twitter at the time, talking to a relative of a federal judge who is in the [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=375.52s)]
*  Federalist Society, very conservative, saying, not a smart move. An attack on one federal judge [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=385.28s)]
*  is an attack on all federal judges. And you saw it time and time again over the next three and a half [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=393.35999999999996s)]
*  years that even the most conservative justices had no patience for the White House thumbing their [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=401.04s)]
*  nose at any federal judges. Yeah, Joe, that's right. It's one thing for the Trump administration [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=408.96000000000004s)]
*  to lose the Wall Street Journal editorial board on tariffs. That's to be expected. But they've [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=414.72s)]
*  lost them now on these rule of law questions. This isn't the first time they've editorialized [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=418.8s)]
*  against them on the rule of law. And they've also lost regular folks in Iowa. I hadn't heard that [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=423.44s)]
*  recording of the Grassley Town Hall. That was remarkable. So across the board, look, you can't [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=429.35999999999996s)]
*  talk to any legal expert, anyone in the legal community who doesn't work for Donald Trump, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=434.15999999999997s)]
*  who thinks this is a good idea, who thinks that the way they've handled this is appropriate. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=438.96s)]
*  People get really concerned and rattled when a president appears to be defying court orders and [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=443.03999999999996s)]
*  an order of the Supreme Court. It's a constitutional crisis, essentially. Now, there's some, as you said, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=449.67999999999995s)]
*  there's wiggle room here. And if this goes back up to the Supreme Court, we can all only hope that [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=455.28s)]
*  they clarify what they mean for the Trump administration to do and spell it out and make [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=459.28s)]
*  it happen, guys. All right, NBC's Ken Delaney. And thank you so much. And we're going to play the [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=465.52s)]
*  comments that a Briego Garcia's wife made yesterday as well in just a moment. But professor at [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=470.4s)]
*  Georgetown University Law Center, Stephen Vladeck, had a piece for the Atlantic entitled What the [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=475.67999999999995s)]
*  Courts Can Still Do to Constrain Trump. And he writes in part this. What's important to recognize [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=482.24s)]
*  is that federal courts have not reached the end of the road in this case. There is a wide swath of [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=488.08s)]
*  daylight and of judicially available relief between invading El Salvador and just taking the government [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=495.28000000000003s)]
*  at its fashionly preposterous claim that it's totally powerless. Federal courts can't tell the [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=502.96000000000004s)]
*  executive branch what to do, but they can tell it what it can't do. And they can provide powerful [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=508.88s)]
*  incentives for the executive branch to choose to take specific steps on its own. A world in which [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=516.16s)]
*  the federal courts become reflexively skeptical of any effort to remove anyone from the United States [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=523.76s)]
*  is one in which the Trump administration's conduct in this one case will prevent it from accomplishing [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=530.08s)]
*  many of its broader immigration policy goals. Of course, Trump and his advisors might think [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=537.84s)]
*  that is a price worth paying. But like so much of their behavior in this case, that too [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=545.0400000000001s)]
*  would be revealing. Joe, there's a long way to go here. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=551.0400000000001s)]
*  Well, I mean, a long way to go. Also, a lot of options for the courts. They can actually [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=556.08s)]
*  cut at the very heart of this alien enemies act that the Trump administration is using [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=560.24s)]
*  and say that it's unconstitutional. It can no longer do that. That's what the professor said [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=567.44s)]
*  later in that Atlantic article. But, David French, love to get your input on this. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=572.72s)]
*  I'm reminded of, I think it was Oliver Wendell Holmes who said hard cases make bad law. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=578.6400000000001s)]
*  This is a hard case. And it's a hard case because actually, if Mr. Garcia were from, say, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=586.8800000000001s)]
*  Honduras, that would be much cleaner. Return him to the United States. We will send him back. We [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=593.28s)]
*  will deport him back to Honduras. Here, he's from El Salvador. He's in El Salvador. And yet in 2019, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=599.52s)]
*  there was a federal judge that said you can't return him back to El Salvador because his life [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=607.4399999999999s)]
*  will be endangered. So sort through everything that you've seen and very interested in your take [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=612.0799999999999s)]
*  on what the next move is because we already know this federal district court judge [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=619.36s)]
*  is moving aggressively to make sure the White House doesn't defy court orders. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=624.64s)]
*  Then it goes to the Supreme Court. What should we expect? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=630.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, part of this is complicated and part of this is simple. The complicated element is [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=635.2s)]
*  it is true that the Supreme Court doesn't have jurisdiction over the government of El Salvador. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=639.6s)]
*  There are limits to what the Supreme Court can order the federal government to do in this instance. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=644.48s)]
*  But what is simple is that the federal government and the Trump administration is obviously not [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=650.48s)]
*  powerless here. And it's very simple and very clear that they're doing nothing at all to [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=655.76s)]
*  effectuate the court's order to facilitate Garcia's return. So an administration acting in good faith [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=661.84s)]
*  here would immediately request his return as a diplomatic matter, immediately seek the return [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=669.52s)]
*  very firmly and clearly. It's obvious the administration is not acting in good faith [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=676.0s)]
*  in response to the Supreme Court or the district court. And Joe, you're right, there is a little [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=681.12s)]
*  bit of wiggle room from saying there is direct defiance of the Supreme Court in this moment. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=686.56s)]
*  But it is absolutely obvious that right now the administration is demonstrating no intention to [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=691.84s)]
*  do anything. And David, let's underline that right now because for people that haven't read [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=697.76s)]
*  the decision, for people that haven't looked at the language, for people that didn't see the [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=703.52s)]
*  news stories written in the New York Times, watching this before the White House appeared [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=709.52s)]
*  to defy the order, there were already warnings that the Supreme Court had written such a [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=715.52s)]
*  sort of a general instruction to the Trump administration on one hand to facilitate. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=725.28s)]
*  And then on the other side of it said, and by the way, court, you can't do anything to get in the way [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=730.32s)]
*  of the executive's power to run foreign policy. I mean, that gave two loopholes to the Trump [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=737.12s)]
*  administration that you knew they were going to drive a truck through, and they have. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xye0x0SCrhw&t=745.52s)]
