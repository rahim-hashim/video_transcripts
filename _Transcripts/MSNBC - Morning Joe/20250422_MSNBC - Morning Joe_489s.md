*  Unclassified [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=141.0s)]
*  Coordinations for media coordination other things that's what I've said from the beginning at the beginning [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=142.44000000000003s)]
*  It was left-wing reporters from the Atlantic who got a hold of it and then wanted to create a problem for the president [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=147.32000000000002s)]
*  This is what it's all about trying to get it President Trump and his agenda [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=152.92000000000002s)]
*  The reporter from the Atlantic the editor at Jeffrey Goldberg did not get his hands on it [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=156.36s)]
*  He was included in the group chat and it was Pete Hegseth who then put the attack plans on [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=162.08s)]
*  That group chat and this group chat on signal on an iPhone was actually started by Pete Hegseth [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=169.88000000000002s)]
*  After the massive scandal of the first signal on the news [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=177.4s)]
*  After the massive scandal of the first signal group chat [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=181.96s)]
*  Concurrently and you know Willie [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=188.4s)]
*  It's kind of funny to hear him talking about like a left-wing left-wing, right? It's like left-wing now. It's [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=190.8s)]
*  Rupert Murdoch's Wall Street Journal editorial page [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=200.4s)]
*  It's the National Review [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=203.68s)]
*  It's conservative generals and admirals [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=206.04000000000002s)]
*  It's really anybody that's ever served in the military that understands and combat as Pete Hegseth understands himself [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=209.04s)]
*  I mean he went on he won missions [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=215.36s)]
*  I'm sure he would have been really angry if when he was killed before he went out on missions, you know [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=218.12s)]
*  the Secretary of Defense was saying [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=224.04000000000002s)]
*  Pete Hegseth's units about to move here or it's just again [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=226.88s)]
*  This is not even close and so when you say left-wing this left-wing that that's kind of like on immigration saying [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=231.12s)]
*  It's just a bunch of left-wingers that want to help gang members when again [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=237.88s)]
*  You've got the Wall Street Journal editorial page the National Review editorial page Joe Rogan, you know, and Colter [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=242.44s)]
*  You've got all of these people expressing concerns about what's happening on immigration again [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=249.04s)]
*  these people are really support the deportation of [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=253.38s)]
*  Illegal immigrants same thing here. You can't point the left-wingers on this one [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=258.2s)]
*  I mean, maybe that works in a tiny tiny bubble [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=262.56s)]
*  But it does not work with anybody that's ever served in uniform doesn't work for anybody who's a traditional [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=267.12s)]
*  Conservative who was a real conservative on military issues who? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=273.20000000000005s)]
*  That's why that's why I really am surprised [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=277.04s)]
*  We brought up before people that served in the military like Tom Cotton who I think told he enlisted after yeah [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=279.24s)]
*  Going to Harvard undergrad and Harvard Law School and then you've got Dave McCormick who served in the military Lindsay Graham served in the military [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=286.54s)]
*  People who understand this is like this is not a close call [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=293.28000000000003s)]
*  This is dangerous for men and women in uniform and you know, if they're not speaking out loudly [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=296.12s)]
*  I certainly hope they're sending a message to the White House. This is just simply unacceptable [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=301.8s)]
*  They all know they all know Pete Hegseth knows as you suggest that this is bad that you cannot put [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=306.76s)]
*  Attack plans any friends and family open source group chat an app on your phone. You can't do that [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=312.44s)]
*  They know that and as we've been saying for the last several weeks [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=318.04s)]
*  These are many of them first in line to attack Hillary Clinton for having a server at her home in New York [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=321.16s)]
*  So they all know and I just go back to the beginning of this what you said on day one [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=327.28000000000003s)]
*  Is if you just said we screwed up right? This was a mistake. That's it [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=332.54s)]
*  This will not happen again [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=337.6s)]
*  And now this is what month happening again of this story and it all and now the second beat of it comes out [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=339.02000000000004s)]
*  There would be forgiveness. I think in most court of course many quarters [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=344.76000000000005s)]
*  They would say that cannot happen again. We screwed up. That's it. Okay can't happen again. We screwed up [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=348.9s)]
*  So when we find out concurrently that it happened at the same time [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=355.46s)]
*  We find that out a month or two later then you can so like we said before terrible mistake will never happen again [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=360.74s)]
*  We we certainly learned a lesson and it's the same thing with a Brea Garcia [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=366.28s)]
*  Like it's very easy. They've already said we made a mistake [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=371.06s)]
*  So they're continuing this out and again, I know some people in the White House think hey, this is great for us [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=374.68s)]
*  Well now it's not when Joe Rogan goes on like a three or four minute rant [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=380.48s)]
*  Talking to all the people that supposedly helped Donald Trump get elected going. This is really frightening. This is really terrible [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=384.16s)]
*  This is a bad bad thing. We are turning into monsters and you know what he's saying [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=390.72s)]
*  We can't turn into monsters to defeat my again. These are sort of own goals [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=395.6s)]
*  You know need to do this you screwed up [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=401.36s)]
*  We've learned our lesson [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=404.76s)]
*  Won't do it again. And with the breakover is here also. It's very simple. Okay, you're right [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=406.48s)]
*  We messed up shouldn't have sitting down Salvador Honduras has decided to accepting boom [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=411.40000000000003s)]
*  It's done [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=416.76s)]
*  But the president trump and his ethos first time around and even more so this time has never admit a mistake never back down [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=417.8s)]
*  Whether it is about a break of Garcia [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=422.8s)]
*  We know that New York Times had reporting last week that their escalation in their fight with Harvard was done by mistake [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=425.2s)]
*  It was a letter that was inadvertently sent. Yeah, what are they gonna do by the way? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=430.24s)]
*  What are they gonna do on that? We haven't covered that enough, but somebody screwed up [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=433.72s)]
*  sent that letter to Harvard and [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=438.6s)]
*  What what are they doing right now? They're not backing off [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=441.88s)]
*  They took the the mistaken letter as their position and that they now they're fighting on those grounds and Harvard last night [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=444.72s)]
*  Announced that they're counter suing they're consuming the administration about those funds in question [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=451.96000000000004s)]
*  And now there's this where they have simply not [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=455.7s)]
*  Admit a mistake about the improper use of signal the first the channel started the group started by National Gear Advisor waltz [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=458.42s)]
*  And at the same time this one started by Defense Secretary Hagseth and now [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=465.21999999999997s)]
*  You [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvsw4db6Iyc&t=487.94s)]
