# 'Our answer to Trump': Dems slam president's 'reckless tariff policies', seek to lower costs
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ)
*  I'm just standing here with my colleagues today to officially launch our lowering costs [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=0.0s)]
*  caucus. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=7.2s)]
*  A new caucus focused on a broad coalition in Congress committed to one clear mission, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=8.2s)]
*  to make life more affordable for the American people. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=16.46s)]
*  That was Democratic Congresswoman Hillary Scolton of Michigan announcing the launch [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=21.72s)]
*  of the new lowering costs caucus yesterday. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=26.6s)]
*  It's the latest effort by Democrats to reach and reengage with voters after last year's [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=29.56s)]
*  elections which saw Republicans take the White House of course and both houses of Congress, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  not to rub it in to my new guests. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=38.96s)]
*  The new caucus also aims to combat President Trump's economic policies as Republicans push [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=41.12s)]
*  toward their mega bill. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=46.72s)]
*  And Congresswoman Scolton joins us now along with another founding member of the lowering [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=49.36s)]
*  costs caucus, Democratic Congressman Derek Tran of California. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=53.12s)]
*  Congressman, we have seen an awful lot of talk about affordability. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=57.72s)]
*  We had Abigail Spanberger who's running for governor of Virginia on the program yesterday [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=60.839999999999996s)]
*  saying that's the number one issue she hears about from voters. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=64.76s)]
*  We saw it in the New York mayoral primary race. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=67.76s)]
*  But different bits of the party seem to have quite different approaches to how to actually [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=71.12s)]
*  tackle affordability. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=74.32s)]
*  What is your caucus hoping to do? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  Well, you know, this caucus is launched by myself, Derek Tran and several other members [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=77.52s)]
*  of Congress who know this crisis firsthand. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=84.08s)]
*  We are in an affordability crisis. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=88.52s)]
*  Derek and I are both parents of young children, you know, and the cost of childcare, the cost [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=90.36s)]
*  of groceries is crippling American people and they want their representatives to do [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=96.88s)]
*  something about it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=103.32s)]
*  So, so this caucus is our answer to Donald Trump who ran on making prices lower and he's [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=104.48s)]
*  done anything but since he has been in the White House. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=112.96s)]
*  His reckless tariff policies is making life actually more expensive for the American people [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=117.08s)]
*  and we're going to combat that through policy and action. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=122.55999999999999s)]
*  But Congressman, you are out of power. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  So it's nice that you set up a caucus, but what can you actually do? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=128.24s)]
*  I mean, people who are paying six X their income in rent that used to be paying two [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=132.12s)]
*  X their income in rent. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=135.92s)]
*  What can you do about that? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=137.38s)]
*  Yeah, you're absolutely right. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=138.38s)]
*  And I think, you know, just because we're out of power doesn't mean we can't tune out [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=139.8s)]
*  the noise of Washington, D.C. and focus on what matters to the American people. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=144.4s)]
*  When I go back in my district to get my hair cut to go grocery shopping with my kids. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=149.08s)]
*  The hair looks very good by the way. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=153.16000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=156.16000000000003s)]
*  Whoever's cussing. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=157.16000000000003s)]
*  The single issue and the main talking point is we don't care if you're a Democrat or [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=158.16000000000003s)]
*  Republican. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=164.52s)]
*  We want to know what you're doing to help us right now because we need relief at the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=165.68s)]
*  grocery store. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=169.04s)]
*  We need relief with child care. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=170.04s)]
*  Let me pick up on that. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=172.92s)]
*  First of all, good luck with the kids. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=173.92s)]
*  I'm in it myself. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=174.92s)]
*  What happened in twenty twenty four? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=179.16s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=180.6s)]
*  Why did it take a wake up like this to get you guys to focus on affordability? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=181.6s)]
*  Or were you focusing on affordability all along and we just didn't notice? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=186.72s)]
*  I think we were focused on affordability and that's why, you know, folks like Derek and [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=190.56s)]
*  I are here. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=194.72s)]
*  I'm the first Democrat in a century to hold my seat in Congress in Grand Rapids. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=196.4s)]
*  And Derek obviously famously had one of the closest races in the country. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=203.08s)]
*  And it's because we stuck to issues like that. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=208.68s)]
*  And I think right now people want to hear what Democrats are going to do, not just complaining [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=211.68s)]
*  about what the other guys are doing wrong. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=217.84s)]
*  They want to see what our proactive plan is. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=220.16s)]
*  And that's exactly why we launched this caucus so that we can talk about what we are going [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=224.23999999999998s)]
*  to do when we're back in power. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=227.51999999999998s)]
*  We talked to one of your Michigan colleagues, Alyssa Slocken, yesterday at the bulwark. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=230.51999999999998s)]
*  And she said, yeah, the reason I won in Michigan and Kamala Harris did not is because I kept [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=234.92s)]
*  talking about economics and affordability. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  Is that your assessment of the top of the ticket as well? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=242.67999999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=245.51999999999998s)]
*  You know, I know that I stayed laser focused on the affordability crisis when I was running. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=246.51999999999998s)]
*  And I think we lost the thread a little bit. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=253.52s)]
*  And the American people need to hear clearly what we're going to do for them, not just [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=256.16s)]
*  what's wrong with Donald Trump. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=262.48s)]
*  So that word clearly is doing a lot of work there. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=263.88s)]
*  Because Congressman Tran, what are your ideas for affordability and how do you express them [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=266.8s)]
*  in a clear, understandable and motivating way? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=274.56s)]
*  The way, frankly, Zora Mamdani did in New York. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=279.44s)]
*  Now, you can say what you want about his ideas, but people got free buses, it frees the rent. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=283.6s)]
*  I mean, these are very simple, easy to understand policies that are connected with a lot of [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=289.68s)]
*  people. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=295.96000000000004s)]
*  What are the caucuses' policies? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=296.96000000000004s)]
*  Look, you can't get any further from New York than Southern California, where I come from [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=298.28000000000003s)]
*  in my district. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=302.88s)]
*  And I cannot speak for all Democrats, but I can speak for my constituents in my community. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=303.88s)]
*  I'm hearing and what I'm feeling as well is when we get back to fall and it's time to [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=309.68s)]
*  shop for back to school, whether it's shoes for the kids, clothes, backpacks, school supplies, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=315.40000000000003s)]
*  these products are coming from somewhere. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=320.64s)]
*  It's not here. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=322.40000000000003s)]
*  And these tariffs are going to kill us. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=324.04s)]
*  So they are worried about having enough money to be able to provide and get these essential [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=325.92s)]
*  products for their kids. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=331.24s)]
*  These are the same worries that I have. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=332.76s)]
*  And that's going to be my focus as I move forward in this caucus. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=334.16s)]
*  Isn't that the issue, to Gene's point, about what we heard in New York? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=337.12s)]
*  I can't imagine for a second that you going around your district, which is a purple district [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=340.36s)]
*  and saying we're going to make free buses and we're going to freeze rents, that that [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=345.32s)]
*  would fly, right? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=349.36s)]
*  You're going to lose a whole load of voters if you go around and say that because they're [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=350.36s)]
*  going to paint you as a socialist, I don't think socialist actually, in America, but [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=353.12s)]
*  a democratic socialist. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=356.72s)]
*  Even that's a bridge too far. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=358.4s)]
*  So for each of you, I mean, you can try and have a unified message that we're all focused [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=360.4s)]
*  on affordability. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=364.28000000000003s)]
*  But when it actually comes down to the implementation of that message, that's where it gets more [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=365.28000000000003s)]
*  complicated and not quite as unified. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=369.16s)]
*  Right? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=371.64s)]
*  That's why over the course of the next year and a half, but beginning next month, we're [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=374.64s)]
*  going to start laying out policy by policy that really connects with the American people, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=381.6s)]
*  that can actually get things done. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=386.36s)]
*  And it's not going to be the government's going to pay for everything or we're going [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=388.16s)]
*  to make everything free. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=391.16s)]
*  Everyone has to pay for it. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=393.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=394.4s)]
*  But we can tackle health care. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=395.4s)]
*  We can tackle child care. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=396.4s)]
*  We can tackle housing through smart and workable policies that bring people together. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=397.56s)]
*  Derek and I are, we're both deeply bipartisan and we're hoping to bring our Republican colleagues [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=404.8s)]
*  along with us in a lot of these policy ideas as well. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=410.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=413.2s)]
*  Democratic congressman Hilary Sculpton of Michigan and Democratic congressman Derek [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=414.2s)]
*  Tran of California, thank you very much for coming in. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=417.6s)]
*  Good luck with the caucus. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=420.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=421.68s)]
*  We're going to be having some Republicans on board, Will. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=422.68s)]
*  If you manage to, come back and tell us. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=423.68s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=426.68s)]
*  Bring them with you. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=427.68s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=428.68s)]
*  Still ahead. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=429.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QchBI8KcQeQ&t=452.68s)]
