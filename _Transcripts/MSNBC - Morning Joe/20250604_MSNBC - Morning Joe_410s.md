# 'Women are going to die because of this': Claire McCaskill slams Trump's move on emergency abortions
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw)
*  The Trump administration is rescinding a Biden-era policy that required hospitals to provide [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=0.0s)]
*  emergency abortions to women whose health is in peril, regardless of state law. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=7.8s)]
*  The guidance was issued to hospitals in 2022, weeks after the Supreme Court overturned Roe [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=14.52s)]
*  v. Wade in an effort to preserve abortion access for extreme cases. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=20.16s)]
*  The Biden administration argued that hospitals needed to provide emergency abortions under [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=26.24s)]
*  the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=31.24s)]
*  That law requires emergency rooms that receive federal funding to stabilize all patients, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=34.62s)]
*  regardless of their ability to pay. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  It does not specifically include abortion, but administrations, going back to President [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=43.84s)]
*  George W. Bush, have interpreted it that way. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=48.8s)]
*  In a letter rescinding the guidance, the Trump administration said hospitals would still [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=53.08s)]
*  be subject to the law requiring them to provide reproductive health care in emergency situations, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=57.56s)]
*  but it did not explain exactly what that meant. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=64.78s)]
*  Some doctors and abortion rights activists say this adds to the growing confusion around [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=69.08s)]
*  emergency care and abortions, and could mean women will not get emergency abortions in [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=73.92s)]
*  states with strict bans. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=81.36s)]
*  And Claire McCaskill, I'd love for you to chime in. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=83.88s)]
*  I'm continuing to be horrified that the American people in electing Donald Trump and continuing [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=86.88s)]
*  with these bans are messing around and finding out because a reproductive emergency doesn't [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=95.32s)]
*  just happen to Democrats. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=104.67999999999999s)]
*  It happens to Republicans. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  It happens to all women. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=107.74s)]
*  Oftentimes, they need abortion health care to save their lives or to save their fertility. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=111.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=119.56s)]
*  My daughter desperately wanted a child, and we were on a trip in California, and I spent [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=121.88s)]
*  hours in an emergency room with her because she miscarried. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=128.14s)]
*  And they gave her the health care that she needed to have at that moment. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=133.51999999999998s)]
*  Women don't go to emergency rooms to get elective abortions. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=139.86s)]
*  That's not where they go. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=144.58s)]
*  They would be turned away at emergency rooms if they were getting an elective abortion. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=146.82000000000002s)]
*  The only reason women go to emergency rooms because it is an emergency. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=151.68s)]
*  They are bleeding. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=156.78000000000003s)]
*  They are in danger. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=158.12s)]
*  Their health is jeopardized. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=159.66000000000003s)]
*  And to say this guy, for him to send out a letter, I'm sure at the urging of those people [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=161.9s)]
*  who want to make sure women have no health care choices when it comes to their reproductive [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=170.02s)]
*  health and not even fully explain the difference between emergency reproductive health care [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=174.78s)]
*  and an emergency abortion, I don't understand the difference. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=183.62s)]
*  It's a distinction without a difference. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=187.54000000000002s)]
*  So I think this topic, Mika, has kind of taken a back seat because of all the nonsense [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=189.86s)]
*  of Trump over the last six months. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=197.22000000000003s)]
*  It's time for us to begin to sound the alarm again. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=199.62s)]
*  And this letter is a good place to do it because women are going to die because of this letter. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=203.22000000000003s)]
*  It will happen. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=210.54000000000002s)]
*  They will bleed out in parking lots because of this letter. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=211.54000000000002s)]
*  Well, this is another post-Dobbs protection being pulled away because the basis of this [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=215.22s)]
*  is EMTALA, which, Mika, you explained at the beginning of the show. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=221.10000000000002s)]
*  But that's basically a law from the 1980s that says you have to provide emergency care [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=223.98000000000002s)]
*  broadly regardless of someone's insurance status. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=228.78s)]
*  That's to make sure that providers and hospitals are giving people what they need when they [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=231.86s)]
*  show up in the emergency room. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=235.3s)]
*  Then in 2022, the Biden administration's HHS added the provision that in response to Texas's [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=236.98000000000002s)]
*  restrictive laws, EMTALA had to provide for abortion and reproductive health care because [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=243.16s)]
*  of the concern that Claire is talking about here, that women were basically being told [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=249.44s)]
*  because providers were either fearful or they appreciated the ideology of the day that Republicans [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=253.48s)]
*  who restrict abortion health care share, that they were worried about what would happen [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=259.24s)]
*  to them if they provided this kind of health care if the woman had other choices. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=263.52s)]
*  Effectively, we were hearing stories from the ground through reproductive health care [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=268.92s)]
*  groups and others that women were basically being told you have to get sicker in order [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=272.28s)]
*  for us to feel that the only option is to do a DNC, is to do something in the abortion [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=276.84s)]
*  health care realm. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=282.76s)]
*  And so this is yet another protection being ripped away here. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=284.23999999999995s)]
*  And I think you're right. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=287.67999999999995s)]
*  It's faded from the national consciousness, but the results and the impact of these kinds [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=289.11999999999995s)]
*  of restrictions are still very much being felt. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=293.76s)]
*  I would add, as someone who's covered the reproductive landscape for a while now, the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=296.79999999999995s)]
*  fear after Dobbs was that you ended up with a patchwork of rules across the country where [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=301.44s)]
*  in some states you had options, in some states you did not. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=305.52s)]
*  This only exacerbates that. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=309.5s)]
*  For example, Colorado has a rule on the books that independently enforces MTALA, but other [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=311.24s)]
*  states do not. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=316.6s)]
*  And so once again, women don't really know where they can go for health care options [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=317.64s)]
*  that they very much deserve. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=321.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=323.8s)]
*  It's just, it's beyond me why health care for women has to just roll backwards to the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=325.92s)]
*  dark ages. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=333.0s)]
*  I mean, this is literally crazy, and we're finding out the hard way just how bad it's [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=334.0s)]
*  going to get for women because of Republicans and because of this letter and because, of [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=339.56s)]
*  course, the fall of Roe. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=344.36s)]
*  And Claire, I'm so sorry for your daughter's loss. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=345.96000000000004s)]
*  Thank you for sharing the story. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=348.8s)]
*  It's a story that's repeating itself across the country for many women, especially in [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=352.59999999999997s)]
*  states with strict bans, who need help, who need life-saving health care. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=356.24s)]
*  And we'll continue to follow it here. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=364.88s)]
*  It won't take a backseat here. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=366.88s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=369.48s)]
*  I got to jump in and say she got great care and was pregnant again within the year, and [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=370.48s)]
*  baby Rose was nine months old this week, and she's amazing. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=378.64s)]
*  I'm so glad. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=382.20000000000005s)]
*  I'm so glad. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=383.20000000000005s)]
*  Claire McCaskill, thank you very much for coming on this morning and sharing. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=384.20000000000005s)]
*  Willie? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0-bdBfbtw&t=389.0s)]
