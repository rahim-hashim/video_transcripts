# 'DEVASTATING': Red state governor says 200,000 residents will lose health care because of bill
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [July 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc)
*  Meanwhile, Democratic governors in red states like Kentucky and Kansas have been warning [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=0.0s)]
*  of the consequences if Republican lawmakers in Congress do pass this massive budget bill [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=5.14s)]
*  as they are expected to do a short time from now. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=9.96s)]
*  Those leaders say it would take health care and food assistance away from Americans who [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  need it most. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=17.1s)]
*  The bill cuts Medicaid, as we've been telling you, by $930 billion and also cuts another [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=18.88s)]
*  $285 billion in food assistance. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=24.72s)]
*  The Congressional Budget Office estimates nearly 12 million Americans will become uninsured [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=28.2s)]
*  by the year 2034 if the bill becomes law, and 3 million more will not qualify for food [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=33.879999999999995s)]
*  stamps known as SNAP benefits. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=40.28s)]
*  Joining us now is the Democratic governor of Kentucky, Andy Beshear. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=43.08s)]
*  Governor, thanks for joining us this morning. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=47.56s)]
*  As we've been discussing for the last several hours, it does look like Speaker Mike Johnson [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  has the votes among Republicans to get this bill through, to get it on the desk of the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=54.239999999999995s)]
*  President of the United States who says he will sign it by the 4th of July. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=58.8s)]
*  As you read through the details of this massive piece of legislation, what will be the impacts [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  on your state? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=68.4s)]
*  Oh, it's going to be devastating. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=69.4s)]
*  This is the day that Donald Trump and the Republican Party are telling the American [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=72.52s)]
*  people, especially in rural America, that they don't care about us. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=77.64s)]
*  If you look at what's going to happen in my state, 200,000 of my people are going to [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=82.48s)]
*  lose their health care coverage. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  20,000 health care workers are going to lose their job. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=88.76s)]
*  This is the Republican majority firing Americans that right now have a good job. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=92.44s)]
*  And 35 rural hospitals may close, which is going to impact every single community they're [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=98.04s)]
*  in. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=103.4s)]
*  What people don't know about rural hospitals is that they're typically the largest or the [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=104.4s)]
*  second largest employer in their community. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=108.38000000000001s)]
*  So you lose all those jobs. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=111.0s)]
*  And every small business in rural America is going to be impacted by having fewer people, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=113.0s)]
*  less dollars cycling through. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=119.08s)]
*  And then when you think about worker productivity for America, it's going to take a nosedive [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  because now you've got to drive two hours to go see a doctor, not just for your appointment, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=125.48s)]
*  but for your kids and your parents. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=130.12s)]
*  And when your parent or grandparent gets kicked off Medicaid because they did not check a [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=132.4s)]
*  box, you're going to have to bring them into your own home. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=136.84s)]
*  Take time off of work and ultimately pay for their medical expenses out of pocket. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=140.24s)]
*  This is just crazy. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=145.64000000000001s)]
*  It's going to hit Democrats, Republicans, independents. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=147.12s)]
*  It's going to hammer the U.S. economy. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=150.0s)]
*  This is the worst bill I've seen in my lifetime. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=152.14000000000001s)]
*  So as you grapple with this, what seems to be inevitable that this is coming your way [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=156.08s)]
*  into states across the country, how do you plug those holes as the governor of Kentucky? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=160.84s)]
*  hospitals are closing in your state. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=167.48s)]
*  What do you do about that on the state level? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=170.48s)]
*  No state has the budget to fix what the federal government that Donald Trump and the Republicans [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=173.51999999999998s)]
*  are about to break. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=179.39999999999998s)]
*  No state can make up for hundreds of billions of dollars of Medicaid payments flowing through [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=180.92s)]
*  our economy. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=188.2s)]
*  If you just look at the economy at large, the health care is one of the fastest growing [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=189.56s)]
*  segments out there. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=194.26s)]
*  And this is the Republicans just taking a hatchet to it. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=196.16s)]
*  We're going to see job losses across America. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=199.79999999999998s)]
*  And listen, we're going to do our best. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=202.32s)]
*  We're going to do our best to plug some holes where we can. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=204.2s)]
*  But even when you look at food assistance, which my faith teaches me that in a country [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=207.04s)]
*  that grows enough food for everybody, nobody should starve. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=211.28s)]
*  The miracle of the fishes and the loaves is in every book of the gospel. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=214.68s)]
*  But look at what they're doing. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=218.64s)]
*  Seniors and children are going to go to bed and wake up hungry. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=221.2s)]
*  That's just wrong. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=225.64000000000001s)]
*  And just the administrative costs pushed on Kentucky is an extra $66 million. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  So you think about plugging other holes. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=232.08s)]
*  On top of that, you have the president not approving public assistance after natural [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=234.08s)]
*  disasters. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=238.56s)]
*  That may cost my state another $300 million. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=239.56s)]
*  So what this federal government is doing is fiscally wrong. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=242.86s)]
*  It's going to add what, trillions of dollars to the federal debt. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=246.6s)]
*  But it's also going to blow up every single state budget where we have to balance those [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=249.88s)]
*  budgets. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=254.92s)]
*  And I don't buy for a minute that they have to cause all this pain just for a tax cut. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=255.92s)]
*  In Kentucky, I've expanded Medicaid, while at the same time lowering the income tax and [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=262.84s)]
*  the property tax rate multiple times. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=267.18s)]
*  You know, Governor, as a governor of a red state, you're a Democrat, but you by definition [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=271.84s)]
*  have to work with Republicans. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=276.62s)]
*  You always have. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=278.15999999999997s)]
*  I've continued to do that. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=279.44s)]
*  How do you explain the vote taken by Republicans in Washington right now in Capitol Hill, many [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=281.0s)]
*  of whom, all of whom, know exactly what you've just said, that it is going to cost their [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=286.86s)]
*  own constituents, the place where they live, the people who voted for them, their health [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=291.68s)]
*  care in some cases, or the hospital that they've counted on for all of their lives? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=295.56s)]
*  Is it anything more than feeling the pressure from President Trump, who was up all night [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=301.02000000000004s)]
*  calling members, who was up all night posting to social media saying, Magga will not be [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=306.20000000000005s)]
*  happy with you, talking about his own movement, if you vote against my bill? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=311.12s)]
*  In other words, how do you explain the members of Congress, let's just take your state of [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=315.92s)]
*  Kentucky, voting against the interests of many of their constituents? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=321.32000000000005s)]
*  Well, it seems like they care more about being a good Republican than a good representative [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=324.52000000000004s)]
*  or senator. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=329.94s)]
*  I mean, they're elected to represent the people of their districts. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=330.94s)]
*  And for every Kentucky congressman or senator that's voting for this, it hammers their constituents. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=334.36s)]
*  People are going to lose their jobs that voted for them and that voted for the president. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=340.68s)]
*  I mean, people have lost their way if they think their number one job is to stick with [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=344.68s)]
*  their party instead of their people. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=348.56s)]
*  You look at all the congressional delegation that voted for it in Kentucky, every single [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=351.24s)]
*  one has a rural or an urban hospital that's going to get hit. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=355.74s)]
*  Every single one is going to run into someone that's going to lose their health care and [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=359.52000000000004s)]
*  not be able to get a cancer treatment. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=363.88s)]
*  Every single one has people in their districts that will die if they do not have health care [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=365.68s)]
*  coverage. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=370.03999999999996s)]
*  Listen, I remember when we expanded Medicaid, my dad was governor at the time and I was [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=371.03999999999996s)]
*  in an elevator with him when a woman walked in, burst into tears and said, I'd be dead [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=374.88s)]
*  without you, without that expansion. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=380.12s)]
*  She could not get coverage because they considered cancer a pre-existing condition. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=382.64s)]
*  But with the expansion of Medicaid and the ACA, she could. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=387.15999999999997s)]
*  These are real lives at stake. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=390.28s)]
*  These are real people and this is a huge betrayal. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=392.2s)]
*  People care more about their families than they do their political party. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=394.97999999999996s)]
*  And so Democrats, Republicans and independents in Kentucky are going to react and react incredibly [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=398.84s)]
*  negatively when their friends are losing their jobs at their hospital. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=404.64s)]
*  Governor, it's Ali Vitale in Washington. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=408.24s)]
*  We were just talking with Ken Martin, the head of the DNC, about how this bill in terms [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=411.0s)]
*  of the issues that it brings up is a gift politically in some ways for Democrats to [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=415.8s)]
*  take back out on the campaign trail in 2026. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=420.28s)]
*  But there are concerns from advocates about the message, this perennial concern that we've [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=423.2s)]
*  heard since 2024. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=427.73999999999995s)]
*  You're someone who has been playing in the space of trying to find different ways of [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=429.64s)]
*  communicating with new constituencies. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=433.11999999999995s)]
*  What do you see in this bill and how do you think it could be best communicated by Democrats [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=435.79999999999995s)]
*  as they head into this midterm year? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=440.23999999999995s)]
*  Well, as Democrats, we've got to recognize that when people wake up in the morning, they're [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=442.15999999999997s)]
*  not thinking about their next election. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=446.55999999999995s)]
*  They're thinking about their job and whether they make enough to support their family. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=448.46s)]
*  A lot of jobs are going to be lost. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=452.02s)]
*  They're thinking about their next doctor's appointment and how far they have to drive. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=453.58s)]
*  It's about to get a lot tougher. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwaRUqExhuc&t=456.71999999999997s)]
