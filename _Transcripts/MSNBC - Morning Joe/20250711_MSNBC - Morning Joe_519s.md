# 'Running scared': Texas Democrat slams state GOP for considering redrawing congressional maps
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [July 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI)
*  We turn back now to the deadly flooding in Texas, where the search continues this morning [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=0.0s)]
*  for the more than 160 people who are still missing. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=4.12s)]
*  President Trump is set to meet with survivors and first responders there later today as [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=10.48s)]
*  the community mourns the scores of victims. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=15.1s)]
*  Texas Governor Greg Abbott had already called for a special session of the state legislature [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=19.56s)]
*  prior to the flooding, but now lawmakers will address the disaster relief and preparedness [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=24.94s)]
*  in the aftermath of the catastrophe. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=31.1s)]
*  And there is another item on the agenda that is rattling Democrats across the state. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=34.46s)]
*  Congressional redistricting, a move that our next guest calls disgusting political gamesmanship [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=39.86s)]
*  at a time when Texas is reeling. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=47.260000000000005s)]
*  Joining us now from Dallas, chairman of the Texas Democratic Party, Kendall Scudder. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=51.22s)]
*  Good to have you on the show this morning, Kendall. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=56.48s)]
*  Kendall, thank you so much. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=58.38s)]
*  While we're doing two things at once, it's the same thing that happened after Katrina. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=63.019999999999996s)]
*  It's to a Republican president, a Democratic mayor, and a Democratic governor in Louisiana. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=68.7s)]
*  It's the same thing that happens after every event. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=75.22s)]
*  You ask if there's something more that could have been done when it seems obvious that [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=77.46s)]
*  there is. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=81.69999999999999s)]
*  We keep getting reports, and no one out this morning, that Texas officials said there's [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=83.36s)]
*  going to be another flood in Carrick County, most likely within the next year, and warning [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=91.1s)]
*  devices would be called for, and yet they didn't do anything. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=101.42s)]
*  In fact, they haven't done anything for the past 10 years, despite the fact that the state [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=107.22s)]
*  has this massive rainy day fund that could have very easily been used, and at least given [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=111.78s)]
*  so many of those people a chance to survive. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=119.94s)]
*  What happened? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=123.5s)]
*  Why didn't they listen to all of the warnings over the past decade? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=126.18s)]
*  Well, and it's not just the Texas rainy day fund that could have been used. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=131.18s)]
*  There were funds passed down by the Biden administration put in the bank accounts of [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=135.94s)]
*  Carrick County government, and they sent it back because they didn't want money from Biden [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=140.14000000000001s)]
*  to do it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=144.14000000000001s)]
*  So as a result, there are people on the ground there who didn't get the appropriate warnings [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=145.14000000000001s)]
*  that they should have. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=149.3s)]
*  Because we had a significantly underfunded national weather service, there were completely [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=150.74s)]
*  vacant positions that should have been alerting people and giving people those warnings. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=154.78s)]
*  I think as time moves on, we're going to get more and more information that will trouble [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=158.94s)]
*  people on what could have been there. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=163.02s)]
*  The reality right now is that what's happening is Republicans for years have worked to discredit [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=165.42000000000002s)]
*  and dismantle these governmental systems that were created to help people. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=171.22s)]
*  And now they're seeing what happens when those programs don't exist. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=175.84s)]
*  They existed for a reason. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=180.32s)]
*  It was because people were depending on them to save their lives in situations just like [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=181.88s)]
*  this. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=186.64s)]
*  And instead of taking this to the legislature to deal with it now, they're masking it or [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=187.64s)]
*  using it to mask things like redistricting. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=192.92s)]
*  And they're going to turn the state into a political circus instead of getting people [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=195.56s)]
*  what they actually need to help their communities. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=199.24s)]
*  Let's follow up on that point just now, Kendall, about redistricting. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=202.92s)]
*  Because then again, let's keep in mind here that tragedy is first and foremost the response [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=206.84s)]
*  to it. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=210.84s)]
*  There's a political nature undercurrent here as well that the governor is trying to push [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=212.8s)]
*  through. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=215.96s)]
*  Tell viewers what that is and why you feel it's so concerning. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=216.96s)]
*  Yeah, so when a lot of people think of Texas, they think of this deep red Republican state. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=220.88s)]
*  But what they fail to realize is that the second largest deliverer of votes to Democrats [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=227.48000000000002s)]
*  in the last election came from Texas. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=233.16s)]
*  There are a lot of Democrats in Texas, and Texas Democrats make up a large chunk of the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=236.04s)]
*  Democratic delegation to Congress. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=240.6s)]
*  So what they're trying to do is redraw the maps in Texas to take four, maybe even up [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=242.84s)]
*  to eight seats away from Democrats in Texas, which would rob the entire country from the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=247.64000000000001s)]
*  opportunity to hold Trump accountable in the 2026 primary. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=253.0s)]
*  They're using this bogus letter from Trump's attorneys at the Justice Department to try [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=257.04s)]
*  to claim that minority protected seats are unconstitutional, which we all know through [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=262.36s)]
*  the Civil Rights Act that that is not true. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=267.32s)]
*  But if they succeed in Texas courts and go up to the U.S. Supreme Court that is largely [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=269.44s)]
*  appointed by Trump and succeed there, they would put a spear through every minority district [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=274.64s)]
*  in the country and then just start peeling away. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=279.71999999999997s)]
*  We could have a wider United States Congress than pre-Reconstruction. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=282.4s)]
*  You know, it's interesting, and you've said this before, but it's so true. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=286.28s)]
*  Political parties that are doing well, they don't read district, like, before midterms. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=295.16s)]
*  So what is the Republican governor of Texas so scared of that he's engaging in this sort [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=302.76000000000005s)]
*  of political gamesmanship in the middle of a Texas tragedy? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  Catastrophe. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=317.28000000000003s)]
*  If you look at the political trajectory of Texas, it has been trending towards Democrats. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=318.78000000000003s)]
*  We had a bit of a setback in the last election, OK? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=324.66s)]
*  I get it. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=326.86s)]
*  But if you look at the last two. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=327.86s)]
*  Why did you? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=329.76000000000005s)]
*  Can I ask you that question? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=330.76000000000005s)]
*  Because it's so fascinating because everybody's been looking at Texas. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=331.76000000000005s)]
*  Texas is going to go blue. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=335.34000000000003s)]
*  And it was like 13-9-5. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=337.42s)]
*  And then Donald Trump had a massive win. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=341.82000000000005s)]
*  Ted Cruz did well. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=344.22s)]
*  Democrats got wiped out along the border. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=346.34000000000003s)]
*  What happened? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=351.38s)]
*  And because of that happening, again, I guess it surprises me so much that the governor [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=353.3s)]
*  is going to be playing politics while you have this search and rescue event and this [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=357.58000000000004s)]
*  just unspeakable tragedy still unfolding in his state. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=364.26000000000005s)]
*  You'd think he would have the good sense to push this off. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=368.26000000000005s)]
*  But why is he so desperate, given how well Donald Trump did in Texas just last year? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=373.74s)]
*  Well, don't ever look for good sense in Greg Abbott, OK? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=382.5s)]
*  The reason the state moved backwards is a conglomeration of different ideas. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=385.46s)]
*  I mean, we struggled across the country in the last election. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=389.66s)]
*  But also, we saw one-fifth of our Democratic voters in Texas stay home and say that Democrats [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=393.1s)]
*  weren't worth voting for. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=398.26s)]
*  If you put them in focus groups, they'll say things like the Democrats don't fight hard [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=399.54s)]
*  enough, they negotiate away the things that are important to us. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=402.65999999999997s)]
*  And I think that Texas Democrats need to get back to our roots of Lyndon Johnson and Sam [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=405.58s)]
*  Rayburn, big, bold, progressive ideas that make Democrats want to show up and vote for [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=409.22s)]
*  them. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=414.94s)]
*  And because we have new leadership now at the Texas Democratic Party, we've been building [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=415.94s)]
*  a grassroots apparatus in every corner of the state. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=419.98s)]
*  There's a new energy here in the last hundred days since that has happened. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=422.62s)]
*  I think Greg Abbott is running scared. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=426.58s)]
*  I think they're worried about what's going to happen there, mixed with the fact that [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=428.58s)]
*  Republicans are going to nominate a certified garbage person as their nominee for the United [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=431.94s)]
*  States Senate here in Texas, and that's Attorney General Ken Paxton. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=437.34000000000003s)]
*  And when they do, Democrats will have the absolute best opportunity to flip a United [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=440.34000000000003s)]
*  States Senate seat in Texas in my lifetime. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=444.86s)]
*  And I think Republicans know that. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=448.26s)]
*  They're running scared. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=450.26s)]
*  And they're going to try to carve up Texas and put a spear through the minority district [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=451.58000000000004s)]
*  protections to the best of their ability and try to, if it's successful in Texas, they're [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=455.5s)]
*  going to try to do it all across the country. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=459.58000000000004s)]
*  And so everyone in the country should be interested in what's happening in Texas. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=461.90000000000003s)]
*  We all have to do everything that we can to stop them from doing it. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=466.1s)]
*  Boy, I really wish they would. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=469.3s)]
*  I really wish they put this off while this tragedy continues to unfold. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=472.3s)]
*  The timing just sounds absolutely terrible. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=477.74s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=480.66s)]
*  Chairman of the Texas Democratic Party, Kendall Scudder, thank you so much for coming on the [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=481.42s)]
*  show this morning. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=486.3s)]
*  Come back. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=487.3s)]
*  We appreciate your analysis. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=488.62s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=491.5s)]
*  Take care. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_OHDjBtsKI&t=492.02000000000004s)]
