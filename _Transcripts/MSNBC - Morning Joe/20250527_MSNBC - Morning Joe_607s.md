# 'Weak,' 'woke': Top Obama official rips party brand as he attempts to shift it to center
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es)
*  Former U.S. ambassador to Japan, Rahm Emanuel, is weighing in on the Democratic Party, calling [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=0.0s)]
*  its brand toxic, weak and woke. Emanuel told the Wall Street Journal Democrats need to pivot back [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  to the center if they want to win elections once again. And that the party has put too much focus [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=14.64s)]
*  on so-called culture war issues that are favored by progressives. Emanuel served in both the Biden [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=21.68s)]
*  and Obama administrations and was the mayor of Chicago. Now he appears to be considering [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=28.4s)]
*  a presidential bid or a possible run for Illinois governor. Meanwhile, the Democratic Party is still [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=35.76s)]
*  searching for a path forward. More than six months after President Trump swept the battleground [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  states and won the 2024 election, a new piece from the New York Times analyzes the gradual split [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=48.64s)]
*  between the party and its traditional base, noting, quote, communities that Democrats had [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=56.160000000000004s)]
*  come to count on for a generation or more, young people, black voters, Latinos, all veered toward [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  the right in 2024, some of them sharply. But as the paper points out, even the attempts from the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=70.0s)]
*  party to address these issues seems out of touch. Quote, Democratic donors and strategists have been [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=77.04s)]
*  gathering at luxury hotels to discuss how to win black working class voters, commissioning new [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=82.88s)]
*  projects that can read like anthropological studies of people from faraway places. The prospectus [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=90.0s)]
*  for one new $20 million effort obtained by the Times aims to reverse the erosion of Democratic [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=97.52s)]
*  support among young men, especially online. It is code named SAM, short for Speaking with American [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=104.32s)]
*  Men, a strategic plan and promises investments to study the syntax, language and content that [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=112.08s)]
*  gains attention and virility in these spaces. It recommends buying advertisements and video games, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=120.32s)]
*  among other things. Whoa. John Hellman, what do you make of that effort, these moves by party leaders? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=127.6s)]
*  Well, Mika, I would say that the focus on language is something we've seen in a lot of [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=136.8s)]
*  political parties when they get into trouble. This is something you can think back to the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=149.68s)]
*  periods where the Republican Party has been out of favor. People think, oh, well, how do we talk [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  differently? How do we have to reach this group? We have to reach that group. And the way to reach [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=159.84s)]
*  this group or that group is to tailor our messaging to try to reach those groups. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=165.2s)]
*  It turns out, at least in our lifetimes, that the way that you start to reach groups that you have [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=170.39999999999998s)]
*  lost favor with or that used to support the party but now don't, and you're losing traction with them, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=177.44s)]
*  is partly a language thing, but really it's more of a substance thing. It's a thing of, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=183.04s)]
*  what does the party believe in? When I hear Rahm, enormous respect for Rahm Emanuel, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=188.79999999999998s)]
*  accomplished a lot. I said this literally on the show last week. Alyssa Slotkin is another person [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=194.88s)]
*  who's been saying the same sort of thing. Weak and woke. That phrase is a phrase that various [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=200.16s)]
*  people who want to moderate the party have been throwing around. What I think is important here [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=206.0s)]
*  is not the question of what the party's image is, but is what does the party stand for? If the party [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=212.79999999999998s)]
*  takes positions on issues that are weak and woke, it will seem weak and woke. If it takes positions [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=220.32s)]
*  that are strong and not woke, that is the way to go forward. It's not about language. It's about, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=228.8s)]
*  where are you going to deviate from what has become democratic ideological conformity? And again, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  I'm sure Rahm has examples. Alyssa Slotkin probably has examples, but that's the conversation. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=241.92000000000002s)]
*  That's the debate. That's the work the Democrats have to do right now is not thinking about their [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=246.72s)]
*  language. The language will follow the positions. The language will follow the substance. And what I [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=251.28s)]
*  am not hearing so far in this first six months after November 6th, after the big loss last year, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=257.6s)]
*  is that kind of work, the kind of reform work that goes to what does this party want to believe in [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=264.96s)]
*  that will lure working class voters of all races back to it. Gene Robinson, it's obviously this [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=271.36s)]
*  idea, some of the ideas that came out in this piece in the New York Times have come in for [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=279.04s)]
*  mockery on social media. We got to get down with the kids and talk to the men and all that stuff, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=282.8s)]
*  but that's all fair. But they do have the right idea, don't they, that they do need to talk to [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=287.28000000000003s)]
*  male voters, particularly young male voters who have really shown an affinity for Donald Trump and [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=293.04s)]
*  for the message of his party. It reminds me of people saying after the election last year that [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=298.96s)]
*  Democrats and liberals need their Joe Rogan. We don't just create a Joe Rogan. He became famous [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=305.12s)]
*  and influential to millions of people organically because people liked what he was saying and [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=311.03999999999996s)]
*  followed him down that way. So maybe the right idea here, it's the execution they might need to work on. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=315.67999999999995s)]
*  Right. You don't start, I think, in my opinion, the way forward on the language piece of this is not [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=322.0s)]
*  to accept the framing of the Republican Party and MAGA, right? So if your framing is woke versus [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=332.72s)]
*  anti-woke, I think you're already losing if you accept that framing. You have to come up with a [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=343.44s)]
*  different framing. And I think, look, how do parties come back? They come back with a new [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=350.16s)]
*  focus. They come back with new candidates, and that's very important. So they need the ideas, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=358.64000000000004s)]
*  and yes, they need to communicate better, but they need candidates that people not just relate to, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=367.36s)]
*  but that people want to believe in because they believe those candidates believe in them. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=376.16s)]
*  And that's the disconnect that they've got a bridge. I think back to after the McGovern [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=383.76000000000005s)]
*  debacle and how the party came back and how ultimately that ended up with Bill Clinton. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=391.6s)]
*  Bill Clinton was, you know, half of that was a different message. Half of that was Bill Clinton. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=400.88000000000005s)]
*  He was a great candidate. And so you have to have both those pieces working if you're really [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=405.84000000000003s)]
*  going to bring your party back. So, John Haman, let's talk about those candidates, even though, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=414.56s)]
*  of course, we're a long way from 2028. We are seeing, surprisingly early, a few would-be [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=419.04s)]
*  contenders make some early moves to put themselves out there, whether that's certainly starting a [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=424.64000000000004s)]
*  podcast like Gavin Newsom or, you know, guarding more headlines or national issues like Governor [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=429.6s)]
*  Pritzker. And then there's Rahm Emanuel, who seems to be the least subtle of all right now, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=433.92s)]
*  making a lot of moves from the day after the election to put himself in this conversation. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=439.28000000000003s)]
*  We don't know that he's going to run, per se, but he at least wants to have a voice. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=444.72s)]
*  That's right, John. And look, there's, you know, Rahm started his life as a political strategist [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=451.12s)]
*  and a political tactician who worked in that Clinton White House that Eugene Robinson was [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=457.52s)]
*  just alluding to a second ago and then made his way into elected politics, was one of the most [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=462.15999999999997s)]
*  successful, politically speaking, one of the more successful speakers of the House in recent years, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=467.03999999999996s)]
*  leaders of the Democratic Party, not Speaker of the House, but leader of the Democratic Party at [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=472.08s)]
*  the DCCC when he led the Democrats back to the majority and then went on and became mayor of [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=475.76s)]
*  Chicago, has served as White House Chief of Staff and now as an ambassador. The man now has an [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=482.4s)]
*  enormous array of experience at every level of government and I think anyone who doesn't take [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=487.76s)]
*  Rahm seriously as a candidate, the combination of his strategic savvy and the campaign know-how [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=491.68s)]
*  that he has along with the fact that he has this now very formidable resume in elective governance [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=498.08s)]
*  would be foolish. He's someone who people sometimes write off because of how blunt he is. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=503.2s)]
*  People say, well, he's not polished enough, etc. etc. I think that there's more activity right now [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=508.56s)]
*  on the Democratic side in terms of people who are out testing the water right now earlier than in any [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=517.2s)]
*  presidential cycle that I've ever seen before. The question is, are we going to end up like we did in [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=522.48s)]
*  the 2020 cycle? People remember, you know, we have 19, 20 Democratic candidates back in 2019 into 2020 [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=529.2s)]
*  and we ended up with Joe Biden winning, the most familiar of all of them ended up being the one the [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=537.6s)]
*  Democrats ended up picking. So again, I go back to the question of what is it that's going to, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=542.48s)]
*  what are the substance? Bill Clinton put the party in a different direction when he embraced free [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=548.08s)]
*  trade, welfare reform, a variety of different things that Democrats in the previous two generations [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=552.96s)]
*  had rejected. Who's going to become the thought leader in this group? That's the question. Right, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=558.5600000000001s)]
*  yeah, I think Rahm Emanuel is a fascinating potential contender and it's interesting how [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=564.1600000000001s)]
*  he distills the message that he thinks Democrats should embrace. He doesn't suffer fools and as you [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=569.9200000000001s)]
*  said, he's blunt, he cuts to the chase. It'll be interesting to see how that works. We'll be [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=576.72s)]
*  following that and John Hellman, thank you so much for coming on this morning. It's always good to see you. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=582.4000000000001s)]
*  you [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTVXyWsC1es&t=593.44s)]
