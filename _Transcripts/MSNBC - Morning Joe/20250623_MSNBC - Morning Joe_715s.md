# Trump views weekend strike as a one-off, doesn't look to escalate further: Jonathan Lemire
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY)
*  Mr. Vice President, is the United States now at war with Iran? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=0.0s)]
*  No, Kristen, we're not at war with Iran. We're at war with Iran's nuclear program. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=6.0s)]
*  The president's been very clear, Kristen. We have no interest in a protracted conflict. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=11.0s)]
*  We have no interest in boots on the ground. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=15.0s)]
*  I don't like the regime, but we're not into the regime change business here. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=17.0s)]
*  We're into the safety and security of the United States business. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=20.0s)]
*  We are not pursuing regime change. We're not trying to put any troops on the ground into Iran. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=23.0s)]
*  We are trying to eliminate their nuclear weapons program. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=28.0s)]
*  No, I don't think I see boots on the ground in our future, but I do see Israel not stopping. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=31.0s)]
*  Some important distinctions being made yesterday by members of the Trump administration and Republicans in the U.S. Senate [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=38.0s)]
*  saying that there's no interest in regime change or putting boots on the ground in Iran. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=45.0s)]
*  But President Trump isn't ruling out one of those possibilities. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=51.0s)]
*  We're going to have his latest comments in just a minute. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=55.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, Iran is promising to retaliate for Saturday's strikes. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=57.0s)]
*  We'll look into what possible options they have. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=61.0s)]
*  It is a terribly shattered government right now. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=65.0s)]
*  Plus, Democrats and at least one Republican lawmaker are calling the action in Iran unconstitutional. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=68.0s)]
*  The question is, what can they actually do about it? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=75.0s)]
*  The answer is about the same thing that members of Congress have been able to do since, well, the end of World War II. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=78.0s)]
*  Good morning and welcome to Morning Joe. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=87.0s)]
*  It's Monday, June 23rd. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=90.0s)]
*  With us, we have co-host of our fourth hour contributing writer of the Atlantic, Jonathan LaMere, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=92.0s)]
*  and U.S. special correspondent for BBC News, Cady K. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=96.0s)]
*  Jonathan, I know you have reporting from the White House, as do I, sharing notes yesterday. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=100.0s)]
*  It does seem that what we heard on the shows yesterday from members of the administration [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=106.0s)]
*  or what the president is thinking directly, which is this is a one-off. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=112.0s)]
*  He wanted to seriously degrade Iran's nuclear program. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=117.0s)]
*  And viewing this more of a Soleimani-type act, a one-and-done unless, of course, American troops are attacked by Iran. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=121.0s)]
*  Right. And certainly the enemy gets a say here. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=130.0s)]
*  And that's the old cliché. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=133.0s)]
*  And Iran will have a vote as to the future of this war. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=134.0s)]
*  But that is correct. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=138.0s)]
*  From what I've been told from White House officials, that this is a decision, a historic decision, that President Trump reached in recent days. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=139.0s)]
*  Then we had a bit of a faint, a bit of a misdirection where he said, well, we're going to wait two weeks, his verbal crutch there, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=146.0s)]
*  before making a decision to actually strike these sites in Iran when really he had already given the go order. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=152.0s)]
*  Now, as always, these things can change at the last minute. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=157.0s)]
*  It didn't become official until minutes before the strikes were launched over the weekend. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=160.0s)]
*  But now that it has happened and U.S. officials still assessing the damage there in Iran, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=165.0s)]
*  senior aides tell me the president does view this as a one-off, that Israel had weakened Iran and the U.S. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=170.0s)]
*  with its pilots, its aircraft, its bombs, then went in to damage and potentially destroy these three nuclear sites. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=177.0s)]
*  Trump has now telegraphed that will be it, that the U.S. does not look to escalate further, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=185.0s)]
*  don't want boots on the ground, aren't looking to keep hitting them, the wild card being, of course, if Iran were to strike back, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=190.0s)]
*  we would almost certainly retaliate. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=196.0s)]
*  Now, Israel's a different matter. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=198.0s)]
*  We'll see where they go from here. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=199.0s)]
*  But Joe, they feel like this was a moment that the U.S., the president made a calculation, the U.S. wanted to step in, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=201.0s)]
*  certainly does violate his pledge for no larger wars, but he hopes this can be contained. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=209.0s)]
*  He hopes this will be it for U.S. involvement, at least for now. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=215.0s)]
*  Well, obviously, growing concerns by the day before the attacks that Iran was speeding toward the possibility of moving toward a nuclear weapon. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=219.0s)]
*  You know, Cady Kay, Henry Kissinger famously said that when you're sitting in the White House [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=229.0s)]
*  and trying to make a decision on foreign policy, possibility of war, you're never handed a good decision and a bad decision. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=236.0s)]
*  You're handed two very difficult choices. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=243.0s)]
*  And the president made that choice. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=246.0s)]
*  And then, as Jonathan said, he did a bit of a head fake talking about two weeks to buy a little bit of operational security while those B-2s sped toward Iran. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=249.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=261.0s)]
*  Yeah. Now we have two big questions. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=262.0s)]
*  How much damage was done and what are the Iranian options? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=264.0s)]
*  So where are we on this Monday morning after this dramatic weekend? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=267.0s)]
*  Well, President Trump now says that three key nuclear sites in Iran were completely and totally obliterated on Saturday [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=270.0s)]
*  after the United States joined Israel's offensive aimed at dismantling Iran's nuclear program. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=277.0s)]
*  The American strikes involved more than 125 military aircraft, including seven B-2 bombers, in a mission dubbed Operation Midnight Hammer. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=282.0s)]
*  The aircraft dropped a series of 30,000-pound bunker-busting bombs, the most powerful non-nuclear weapons in the U.S. arsenal. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=292.0s)]
*  It was the first time that they'd ever been used in combat. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=300.0s)]
*  American sailors also fired dozens of cruise missiles from a submarine. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=303.0s)]
*  On social media yesterday, the president described the damage to the nuclear sites as monumental, calling it an obliteration. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=308.0s)]
*  Again, NBC News cannot independently verify, though, the level of damage. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=315.0s)]
*  President Trump is now set to meet with his national security team this afternoon in the Oval Office. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=320.0s)]
*  Iran, meanwhile, is warning that the U.S. should expect heavy consequences for these actions. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=326.0s)]
*  That threat came early this morning from a spokesperson for Iran's central military headquarters. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=332.0s)]
*  In a recorded video statement, he called President Trump the gambler for joining the Israeli conflict with Iran, adding, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=337.0s)]
*  quote, You may start this war, but we will be the ones to end it. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=344.0s)]
*  Before Saturday's strikes, Iran had threatened to activate terrorist sleeper cells inside the U.S. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=348.0s)]
*  That message was reportedly delivered to President Trump last week through an intermediary at that G7 summit in Canada. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=354.0s)]
*  The State Department has also warned that Iran could launch cyber attacks on U.S. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=361.0s)]
*  networks and target current and former U.S. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=366.0s)]
*  government officials whom it blames for the 2020 killing of Iran's top general. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=369.0s)]
*  Saturday night, after the strikes, President Trump posted that any retaliation against the United States would be met with greater force. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=374.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, President Trump is floating the idea of a regime change in Iran. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=384.0s)]
*  In a Truth Social post yesterday, the president wrote, quote, If the current Iranian regime is unable to make Iran great again, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=389.0s)]
*  why wouldn't there be a regime change? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=397.0s)]
*  This is the first time Trump's raised the possibility of changing the leadership in Iran since Israel launched that war 11 days ago. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=400.0s)]
*  The president's comments also break from the restance of the rest of his administration that they've been taking, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=409.0s)]
*  as they've been saying the intention of Saturday's strike was not to push for regime change, but to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=415.0s)]
*  This mission was not and has not been about regime change. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=424.0s)]
*  The president authorized a precision operation to neutralize the threats to our national interests posed by the Iranian nuclear program [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=429.0s)]
*  and the collective self-defense of our troops and our ally Israel. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=439.0s)]
*  Does the United States support Israel killing Iran's leader? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=446.0s)]
*  Well, look, that's up to the Israelis. But our view has been very clear that we don't want a regime change. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=452.0s)]
*  We do not want to protract this or build this out any more than it's already been built out. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=458.0s)]
*  We want to end their nuclear program. And then we want to talk to the Iranians about a long-term settlement here. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=463.0s)]
*  This mission was a very precise mission. It had three objectives, three nuclear sites. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=470.0s)]
*  It was not attack on Iran. It was not an attack on the Iranian people. This wasn't a regime change move. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=475.0s)]
*  This was designed to degrade and or destroy three nuclear sites related to their nuclear weaponization ambitions. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=480.0s)]
*  And that was delivered on yesterday. What happens next will now depend on what Iran chooses to do next. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=487.0s)]
*  If they choose the path to diplomacy, we're ready. We can do a deal that's good for them, the Iranian people, and good for the world. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=492.0s)]
*  If they choose another route, then there'll be consequences for that. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=498.0s)]
*  Let's bring in right now Colin, associate editor for The Washington Post, David Ignatius, also with us, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Karim Sajapour. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=502.0s)]
*  He focuses on Iran and U.S. foreign policy toward the Mideast. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=512.0s)]
*  David Ignatius, let me begin with you. Obviously, there is a lot of back and forth right now after the president's post yesterday. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=517.0s)]
*  But I spoke to somebody that is very familiar with the president's thinking. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=526.0s)]
*  And this is not about regime change, just as everybody said yesterday on the Sunday shows. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=532.0s)]
*  They wanted to seriously degrade the possibility of Iran developing a nuclear weapon, and they feel like they were successful. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=538.0s)]
*  Curious what your reporting is showing you. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=550.0s)]
*  So we speak of the fog of war during conflict. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=552.0s)]
*  I think two days after there's a little bit of fog of intentions about just what the U.S. and certainly what Iran intends to do. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=557.0s)]
*  If President Trump isn't interested in regime change, then he shouldn't have a social media post late last night saying that he is. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=567.0s)]
*  That certainly muddied the water. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=576.0s)]
*  I think the hope had been after the decisive and I have to say well planned strike by the seven B-2s and their huge munitions, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=579.0s)]
*  that they might be able to enter a discussion with Iran about ending the war, in effect dictate a surrender. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=591.0s)]
*  The talk that came from Vice President J.D. Vance about the eagerness to negotiate, I think, reflected the administration's hope that we could now move into the peace negotiation phase. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=600.0s)]
*  Trump, from the beginning of this crisis back in February or so, has been thinking about a negotiated way out. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=613.0s)]
*  That way out doesn't seem so obvious today. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=620.0s)]
*  The Iranians have reacted as you'd expect, angrily beginning to suggest their options, promising retaliation. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=623.0s)]
*  The reaction of the international community similarly has been pretty sharp. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=631.0s)]
*  And there's some big questions that I hope we'll talk about this morning. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=635.0s)]
*  Like, for example, where is the 400 kilograms of highly enriched, enriched to 60 percent uranium that Iran had been keeping in a stockpile? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=639.0s)]
*  There are reports that that stockpile was moved before the bombing. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=651.0s)]
*  It was supposed to be in Isfahan, one of the three nuclear sites the U.S. had. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=656.0s)]
*  Where is it now? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=661.0s)]
*  It's important to know that because that could be used as the fuel for some kind of follow-on weapon in coming months, years. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=663.0s)]
*  So that's just one example of, as I said, the fog that exists two days after the action about what are the continuing consequences? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=675.0s)]
*  Has the U.S. obliterated the program or not? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=684.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUYl7jSYNxY&t=704.0s)]
