**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [April 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc)
*  man mistakenly deported El Salvador, Kilmar Abrego Garcia remains in prison [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=0.0s)]
*  this morning. The White House continues to push back against the Supreme Court [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=6.36s)]
*  orders to facilitate his return to the U. S. This is NBC News has learned of [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=10.14s)]
*  plans by the administration to resume using the Alien Enemies Act to deport [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=15.14s)]
*  migrants as early as today. Let's bring in right now. The borders are for the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=19.92s)]
*  Trump administration. Tom Homan, Mr. Homan, thank you so much for being with [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  us. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=27.7s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=30.12s)]
*  Um, so, uh, just wanted to ask you about that NBC report that, uh, the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=31.92s)]
*  administration is thinking about using the alien enemies act again and may use [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=37.68s)]
*  it as early as today. Can you report? Can you either confirm that or deny [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=44.4s)]
*  that report? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  I think we're discussing it. It's a tool in toolbox is a useful tool. I mean, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=51.620000000000005s)]
*  the President Trump can choose to invoke the authorities he has under alien [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=56.06s)]
*  enemies act act created by Congress against those are enemies United States. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=59.48s)]
*  So, yes, it's a tool in the two shed. And when, yes, it's still on the table. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. The, um, as you know, the court ruled Brett Kavanaugh wrote for [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=67.28s)]
*  the court nine. Oh, that in future deportations that he basically echoed [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=73.32s)]
*  what Scalia had said earlier. And that is anybody that's in America that's [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=79.28s)]
*  going to be deported needs to receive notice first and then they need to have [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=84.25999999999999s)]
*  a hearing before a judge. Um, is that, uh, is that a ruling that the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=88.84s)]
*  administration and you specifically will be following? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=96.0s)]
*  We're not talking about Americans. We're talking about aliens. But you know, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=102.16s)]
*  we'll President Trump has been clear. We'll follow that will follow the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=105.68s)]
*  decision by the Supreme Court. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=108.48s)]
*  Right. And again, the protections do extend according to the Supreme Court. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  Scalia others to, um, uh, to illegal immigrants. Um, in the Abrego case, we [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=118.08000000000001s)]
*  we've had, uh, had many conservatives, of course, come out being very critical [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=126.0s)]
*  of it. But again, we've also had the court rule nine. Oh, that the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=132.28s)]
*  administration should facilitate a brego Garcia's return. I know you've said [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=138.28s)]
*  you're not a lawyer. You're not in the Justice Department. Not your basically [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=144.8s)]
*  not your job. But the administration's admitted. It's a mistake. All parties [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=149.44s)]
*  have admitted it's a mistake. Uh, do you admit that it's a mistake? And is this [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=154.28s)]
*  something that should not happen again? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=159.28s)]
*  Look, I don't I don't agree with the term. Those mistake. I mean, I know [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=162.84s)]
*  that was that was put out in the beginning. But look at this case, there's [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=166.88000000000002s)]
*  a couple of things in play here. First of all, it's a mistake because the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  president said he had withholding withholding or removal. Well, the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=173.44s)]
*  holding the facts wrong that withholding have changed over the years. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  For instance, when that when that decision was made, the methoding he [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=179.8s)]
*  wasn't classified as a terrorist, which is now and plus the conditions of [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=183.36s)]
*  withholding was a danger of a specific gang in El Salvador. That gang don't [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=188.0s)]
*  exist anymore in El Salvador. Matter of fact, El Salvador is one of the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=192.88s)]
*  safest nations in the region now because the actions of President Buckeye. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=195.96s)]
*  So the facts wrong that decision have changed. And we believe that the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=200.48s)]
*  withholding order is set aside now that he's a terrorist because it doesn't it [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=206.76s)]
*  doesn't pertain to those designated terrorists. He is member MS 13. Two [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=210.35999999999999s)]
*  federal judges have decided that we have a police department who documented [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=215.44s)]
*  that ice intelligence has documented that documented that the El Salvadoran [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=220.16s)]
*  government says the MS 13 game member who has since been designated as a [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=224.32s)]
*  terrorist. So the entire condition around that decision have changed. The [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=228.6s)]
*  facts have changed. So we don't think the withholding is in play anymore. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=233.2s)]
*  Well, the courts originally thought he may be a terrorist and and and federal [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=238.56s)]
*  judge said so. But of course, as I'm sure you know, the informants, the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=245.28s)]
*  testimony was conflicting. And and in fact, even the detective was suspended. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=253.12s)]
*  That was a part of that. And the courts let him go. And the Trump administration [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=259.0s)]
*  didn't fight that order because there was there was no evidence ultimately to [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=265.68s)]
*  keep him in prison because he committed any crimes. And then again, he got this [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=270.0s)]
*  special protective order. He checked in regularly with his immigration officers [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=273.96s)]
*  and his family. And he was released. He was released. He was released. And [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=280.04s)]
*  the police did that all the way through January of this year. So So I guess [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=285.84s)]
*  what I'm curious about is what's changed the circumstances from 2019 when the [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=293.08s)]
*  Trump administration agreed with the court, didn't appeal it and let him be [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=298.72s)]
*  released back to his family and gave him this special protective status. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=304.4s)]
*  Department Intelligence from ICE and the Al Salvadoran government themselves. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=310.08s)]
*  He's a citizen and national of the country of El Salvador. He has an order [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=316.2s)]
*  of deportation. They should buy a judge. So let's say he was to come back. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=320.52s)]
*  He's gonna be detained and deported because there's already deportation. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=327.16s)]
*  He's either gonna be deported El Salvador or another country. But but [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=331.08s)]
*  what you asked what what has changed the facts that have changed is that he is [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=334.56s)]
*  designated MS 13 member who was now designated as a member of a terrorist [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=339.40000000000003s)]
*  organization with withholding no longer applies, at least in our opinion, not [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=344.40000000000003s)]
*  let D. O. J. Fight that out. I'm not an attorney. I let the term to justify it [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=348.48s)]
*  now. But that is a stance that I believe we are right now and we'll continue [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=352.44s)]
*  to litigate it. But I think we removed the bad guy from this country who was [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=357.40000000000003s)]
*  down at home in the custody of his country in this country. That's to make [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=360.88s)]
*  the decision to release him. I mean, there's there's certain steps can be [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=364.96000000000004s)]
*  taken through an extradition, whatever. But right now we think we made the [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=369.56s)]
*  right steps and we took to get bad guy and remove them from the United States [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=372.48s)]
*  and now he's home. Right. So for viewers that are watching what the order said [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=376.04s)]
*  was back in 2019 that he could be deported, but he could not be deported [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=381.52000000000004s)]
*  to El Salvador. So the procedure would be if he came back to the United States [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=387.36s)]
*  and then be deported. If he were deported to the Netherlands or if he [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=391.76s)]
*  were deported to Honduras, any country but El Salvador, the courts would rule [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=395.36s)]
*  that to be legal. I want Mr. Holman. Let's let's move on. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=399.59999999999997s)]
*  El Salvador, El Salvador, El Salvador is not off the table. Again, the situation [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=405.8s)]
*  about the withholding of El Salvador, such was totally changed. The gang he [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=410.68s)]
*  feared doesn't exist anymore in El Salvador. So the dangers are the basis [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=414.28s)]
*  for the withholding no longer exists. And that's where I say not only do those [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=419.08000000000004s)]
*  dangerous no longer exist, he's also designated terrorist organizations [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=422.68s)]
*  doesn't apply. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=426.40000000000003s)]
*  Right. And of course, those are, as you've said, you're not a lawyer. You're [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=428.44s)]
*  gonna let the Justice Department speak for it. But that is the issue. I suspect [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=432.0s)]
*  we're gonna see courts fighting about in the coming weeks and months about his [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=435.36s)]
*  return. If if he is in fact returned, if he goes somewhere other than El [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=441.04s)]
*  Salvador. I want to ask you just generally about deportation. You worked [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=445.92s)]
*  I'm sure this will surprise a lot of viewers. You worked for President Obama. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=451.76s)]
*  President Obama actually gave you a presidential award. President Obama, of [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=456.6s)]
*  course, many people might remember, was criticized for being a deporter in [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=460.52000000000004s)]
*  chief. I got a number here. There are over 2.5 million deportations under the [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=463.8s)]
*  Obama administration. I wanted to ask you as this administration, I think [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=469.52000000000004s)]
*  Trump administration reported one million during the first term, you're [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=475.84000000000003s)]
*  trying to reach some goals that I think, especially with funding cuts are going [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=479.64000000000004s)]
*  to be really hard to reach. I'm wondering, is there is there the possibility of [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=485.52000000000004s)]
*  this administration encouraging self deportation? Obviously, there are a lot [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=493.08000000000004s)]
*  of people, illegal immigrants who are are are very scared, would probably [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=498.04s)]
*  like to be given the opportunity to return to their their homes without [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=504.68s)]
*  ending up in maximum security prisons. Is this something as borders are that [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=510.1s)]
*  you and the administration is trying to work through? Because that obviously be [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=516.62s)]
*  a lot cheaper, be, I think a lot better for everybody. Um, is that something [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=520.28s)]
*  that you all are considering? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=526.26s)]
*  Well, we're working the CBP one happens now the CBP home map. We hope people [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=529.66s)]
*  take advantage of it, especially those who are United States who don't have an [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=533.46s)]
*  order deportation yet. Because if we have to go through the process of going [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=537.54s)]
*  through the courts, getting order deportation and we have to find you [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=542.1s)]
*  remove you, then you have a bar from reentering. So we want people if you're [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=545.06s)]
*  in the country, go home, do things the right way. Then you don't have that bar [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=549.22s)]
*  placed against you. So if you have a U. S citizen child, he can petition for you [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=553.0999999999999s)]
*  if you want to come in on a work visa or visitor visa or come in some sort of, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=557.2199999999999s)]
*  you know, uh, some sort of other status, maybe as a student coming to country [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=561.54s)]
*  the right way that leaves that ability open for you. But if you get formally [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=566.42s)]
*  reported, there's automatic bar set against you. So people take advantage of [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=569.9399999999999s)]
*  it. And President Trump has said before, you know, people we've, you know, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=573.4599999999999s)]
*  depending on the situation, depending on what job series it is, he's looking at [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=578.3399999999999s)]
*  ways to bring people back to the United States the right way. What I like about [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=583.6999999999999s)]
*  that, when they come in the right way, they're not giving their life savings [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=587.62s)]
*  to the criminal cartel to come across the river or go through a desert. Less [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=591.14s)]
*  aliens would die. Uh, and, uh, board patrol will be 100% vision online rather [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=595.18s)]
*  than still dealing with the humanitarian crisis that the Biden [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=600.38s)]
*  administration created where board chose also line, you know, taking care of this [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=603.66s)]
*  humanitarian crisis, you know, whether it's preparing food, making hospital [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=607.54s)]
*  runs and everything. And when you take board places off the line during a [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=610.78s)]
*  illegal crisis like that, that's when the fat and all comes across, killed [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=614.38s)]
*  according to Americans. That's when sex trafficking women, children, one 600%. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=618.6999999999999s)]
*  That's when a record number of people on terrorist watch this comes across an [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=622.66s)]
*  unguarded border. So doing things your right way keeps board patrol on the job, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=625.9399999999999s)]
*  vigilant 100% of the time and let people coming through right way through the [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=630.02s)]
*  That's what President Trump's aiming for. So, so, so, so walk me through the [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=633.74s)]
*  process of your will. So if you're an illegal immigrant and you're in America, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=638.5s)]
*  let's say you have a child that was born here and you're very scared, rightfully [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=643.7s)]
*  by a lot of things that you're seeing on television. Um, what, what, what, what [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=647.94s)]
*  are the steps that you take to, to, uh, voluntarily self deport and then go back [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=652.0600000000001s)]
*  to your home country and then apply to come here legally? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=660.86s)]
*  You go to CBP home map. You apply to CBP home map. Most have access. Most just [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=666.26s)]
*  about all of them have cell phones. They came across the border with cell phones. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=672.46s)]
*  They know the CBP one app could many millions came across, uh, at the border [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=675.62s)]
*  and hundreds of thousands came through the CBP one app. So you should go [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=680.66s)]
*  through the CBP one app. You can't go to an ice office and turn yourself to an [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=684.32s)]
*  ice office. That brains was made to go home. There's a lot of ways to self [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=689.38s)]
*  remove and the government is willing to help you. But if you're in the country [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=693.42s)]
*  legally, you should be concerned. Uh, it's not okay to be in the country [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=697.78s)]
*  legally. It's not okay to enter this country legally. It is a crime. So make [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=701.58s)]
*  it right. Turn yourself in either to the CBP one home app or go to an ice [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=705.26s)]
*  office, immigration, custom enforcement office and make arrangements for your [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=709.18s)]
*  turn. That way you can put your affairs in order and go home the right way. And [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=712.5s)]
*  you know, you can certainly take advantage of the numerous ways to come [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=717.26s)]
*  back to this country legally, but it's not okay to enter this country legally. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=720.46s)]
*  It is a crime. So if you're in the country legally, you should not be safe [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=723.7s)]
*  insecure and comfortable being in the country legally. Like you and I would [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=727.88s)]
*  not be no relaxed being another country legally. If you're in the country, make [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=731.12s)]
*  it right. You know, give yourself some opportunities in the future to come to [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=735.74s)]
*  the greatest nation on earth. And if they do that, if they if they go to the [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=738.62s)]
*  app or they go to ice officials, are you you guaranteeing that if they want [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=745.34s)]
*  to self deport and do it the right way, as you say that they will be traded [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=752.7800000000001s)]
*  treated humanely on and be allowed to go back to their homeland in a humane [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=757.1s)]
*  manner? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=763.5400000000001s)]
*  We treat all people humanely. I know there's a lot of bad stories. I think [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=766.48s)]
*  would disagree. But look, I've been doing this. I've been I've been doing [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=771.62s)]
*  this since 1984. We do things humanely. We're the most giving nation in the [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=774.94s)]
*  world. We welcome more people to this country refugees than any other nation [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=780.42s)]
*  in the world. It's somewhat this very given nation. And I've been in this [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=786.8s)]
*  business in 1984 and we do everything humanely. Well, I think Mr. Oman, I've [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=789.7s)]
*  always said America's fed and freed more people across the world than than [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=796.58s)]
*  any country that's ever existed. We're city like Reagan said that shines [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=802.34s)]
*  brightly on the hill for all the world to see. I think, though, people are [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=807.34s)]
*  seeing some of the situations, especially with what's happened with [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=811.58s)]
*  people being pulled off the streets and sent down to a maximum security prison [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=815.36s)]
*  in El Salvador without any due process. Like what you know, what you know, Joe, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=820.6600000000001s)]
*  people look at that if you want me finished and then I'll start. I'll let [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=825.42s)]
*  you finish. That strikes a lot of Americans as being un American and that [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=830.98s)]
*  even people like myself that's been talking about the need for strong [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=836.58s)]
*  borders for 30 years. You know, I think a lot of conservatives not gonna read [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=840.58s)]
*  your quotes from a lot of conservatives here who say they want gang members out. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=845.9s)]
*  They want violent members out. But there's a right way to do it. And [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=850.54s)]
*  there's a wrong way to do it. And a lot of people believe that what we've seen [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=854.38s)]
*  over the past three months is the wrong way to do it. I'm sorry. Go ahead. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=857.62s)]
*  No, look, American people voted for this American people voted for Donald [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=862.9399999999999s)]
*  Trump. This is number one issue. Vast majority Americans want illegal [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=866.3s)]
*  amish move from this country and it's done humanely. However, we gotta [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=869.78s)]
*  remember this. There are millions of people standing in line, taking their [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=873.1s)]
*  tests, doing their background investigation, paying their fees to be [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=877.26s)]
*  part of the greatest nation on earth. They're sitting in the back seat. Well, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=880.74s)]
*  10.5 million illegal amish came to this border, enter this country illegally, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=884.6999999999999s)]
*  which is a violation of law. There's right way and right way to come to this [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=889.78s)]
*  country legally. The people came across me, they call them asylum seeks. But [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=892.9s)]
*  you and I both know if you look at the immigration court data, nine out of 10 [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=896.62s)]
*  of those so called asylum seekers will end up with the order removal. They [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=900.18s)]
*  overwhelm the system on purpose. Why? Because they know it's gonna take 579 [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=903.9s)]
*  years to have a hearing, which they will lose. But now they have U. S citizen [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=908.98s)]
*  kids. Now they own equities. Now there may be Democratic administration in [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=912.82s)]
*  power, which award amnesty. They're playing the long game, but we're [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=917.32s)]
*  enforcing laws as enacted by Congress, which you remember. We're not making [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=920.46s)]
*  this up. We're enforcing laws on the books, including the alien enemies act, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=925.22s)]
*  which is act created by Congress. We're simply using laws on the books to make [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=928.48s)]
*  this country safe again. Yeah, well, and you know, it's interesting. One of the [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=932.78s)]
*  arguments you made, I would make all the time when I was in Congress, I [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=938.26s)]
*  would have people, whether they were from Pakistan or let the way wherever [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=941.38s)]
*  they were from, they would come to the United States that want to come to the [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=946.38s)]
*  United States and they would stand in line and it would be a very long line. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=950.38s)]
*  And I always thought it was unfair that they stood and waited in line, uh, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=954.7s)]
*  while other people were able to just come across the border. So again, I [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=959.58s)]
*  think we agree on that point. Uh, what? What again, why I'm asking you though, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=964.18s)]
*  is, uh, whether the administration can do this in a way that is consistent [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=969.58s)]
*  with the United States Constitution and with what nine members of the United [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=975.5s)]
*  States Supreme Court said, which is you cannot remove somebody that is here [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=979.42s)]
*  even illegally if they are in America without giving them notice and without [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=984.18s)]
*  giving them due process before a judge. Is that something that you've been [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=989.5s)]
*  instructed to do moving forward? Because nine members of the Supreme Court say [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=995.3000000000001s)]
*  that everybody deserves that opportunity in America. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1000.14s)]
*  We are using the laws on the books, the existing laws to secure this border and [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1006.1s)]
*  to remove people here illegally with a priority on public safety threats and [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1012.62s)]
*  national security threats. We're not making this up. We're following the law [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1015.58s)]
*  unlike the last administration who ignored the law, who actually violated [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1018.74s)]
*  it, violated law of bringing 100,000 people, given them pro status and [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1022.22s)]
*  misuse of the pro statue. As you're well aware, there wasn't a case by case [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1026.14s)]
*  analysis of the hundreds of thousands they pro in this country legally. But [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1029.6200000000001s)]
*  now all of a sudden they want a vetting process for deportation. There's no [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1033.14s)]
*  vetting process for the hundreds of thousands, actually millions of people [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1036.74s)]
*  they've released in the country, no vetting process at all. But now they [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1040.38s)]
*  expect the vetting process who those who've seen an immigration judge been [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1043.98s)]
*  ordered removed and all of a sudden they want to even a more of a vetting [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1047.14s)]
*  process for those deported. It's ridiculous how the left has changed [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1049.74s)]
*  the story from releasing millions into the United States to now they got a [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1056.5s)]
*  court order to deport them. Now we got to do after accept, give them an extra [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1061.14s)]
*  vetting, the vetting they didn't get when they came in. It's just ridiculous. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1064.5800000000002s)]
*  Well, again, I don't know that it's... [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1068.98s)]
*  But we will follow the law. We'll use the laws on the books to enforce the [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1070.8200000000002s)]
*  law. We're going to use existing laws, Joe. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1075.02s)]
*  Okay, so yeah, I was just going to say I don't think it's ridiculous that the [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1077.9s)]
*  Supreme Court says what they say. But my follow up question was going to be what [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1081.1s)]
*  you just said. Do you commit to following the law following what the [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1084.5s)]
*  Supreme Court says? And we've heard the president of the United States say [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1088.46s)]
*  several times in the Oval Office that he will follow the law and what the court [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1092.82s)]
*  say. Do you do you agree with that? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1097.66s)]
*  Yes, sir, we will. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1101.02s)]
*  Okay, let me ask you. You had said, just circle back, just a fact check here. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1102.86s)]
*  You had said that the Biden administration worked illegally to get [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1110.02s)]
*  illegal immigrants in America. Did they violate a court order doing that? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1119.46s)]
*  When you say illegally, what do you mean by that? [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1126.02s)]
*  I think they violated the pro statue. The pro statue says you can approach [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1128.02s)]
*  somebody on a case by case basis based on the intricacies of each case, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1133.3799999999999s)]
*  the specifics of each case. They didn't do that. President Biden stood at [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1142.1399999999999s)]
*  this stage and said, I'm bringing 30,000 a month in to CHNV, Cuba, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1145.86s)]
*  Nicaragua, Haiti, Venezuela. I'm bringing 30,000 a month in. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1150.02s)]
*  Where's the case by case analysis on that? It's required under the pro [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1153.78s)]
*  statue. And they brought him in. As a matter of fact, a lot of the [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1157.66s)]
*  Venezuelans he brought into the CHNV weren't even in Venezuela. They were [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1160.78s)]
*  living in Ecuador. So there wasn't a case by case analysis. These people [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1165.18s)]
*  are really escaping fear and persecution from the homeland. They're [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1168.6200000000001s)]
*  coming to United States for a better life, and I get that. But it's not [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1171.9s)]
*  asylum. They're not escaping fear and persecution from their homeland, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1176.22s)]
*  especially if they're not in the homeland. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1179.14s)]
*  I'm not aware. Did they defy any court orders on that issue? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1182.02s)]
*  The fifth district court said not only they're ignoring the law, they [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1186.34s)]
*  believe they're actually violating the law. They weren't doing a case by case [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1190.46s)]
*  analysis on parole. The administration said, oh, we got the border numbers [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1193.26s)]
*  down. No, they didn't. They created CHNV bucket. They created the CBP one [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1197.66s)]
*  app. The same illegal aliens south of the border, they put in three different [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1202.74s)]
*  bucks. They put a CHNV program, then they created a CBP one app they'd [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1206.42s)]
*  call legal pathways, which they weren't. So they simply said, okay, we'll put [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1210.18s)]
*  thousands in the CHNV. We'll put thousands CBP one app. Then we can say [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1213.78s)]
*  the border numbers are down because we're only gonna count those entering [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1217.94s)]
*  between the ports of entry. It was a shell game. And I think what you see [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1220.6200000000001s)]
*  in the Trump ministry, President Trump was able to do in seven weeks what [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1224.6200000000001s)]
*  the Biden administration couldn't or wouldn't do in four years, actually [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1229.6200000000001s)]
*  have the most secure border in my lifetime. Right now, the data shows [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1233.06s)]
*  right now, as you and I are talking, we have the most secure border in the [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1236.66s)]
*  history of this nation today because of President Trump. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1240.46s)]
*  And you're saying that that can be done following the law, and you will [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1246.02s)]
*  follow whatever the Supreme Court rules on in the coming weeks and months, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1253.94s)]
*  right? [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1258.66s)]
*  You know, one of the biggest things you're following the law, securing the [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1260.74s)]
*  border, we ended up catching a leash. No statute says if you come to our [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1263.26s)]
*  border without proper documentation, you shall be detained. Not maybe, not [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1266.46s)]
*  think about it. And that's what we do. We ended up catching a leash. So look, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1272.6200000000001s)]
*  and look at the success on border. And when border crossings are down 95%, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1275.9s)]
*  let me end with this, because I've been doing this since 1984. When 95% less [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1281.74s)]
*  people are coming across that border illegally, how many women aren't being [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1286.0600000000002s)]
*  sexually assaulted? How many children aren't dying? How many pounds of [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1288.8600000000001s)]
*  fattening coming across the two Americas? [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1292.26s)]
*  I agree with you. I agree with you, Mr. Holman, as far as how the border was in [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1293.9s)]
*  chaos and has been in chaos for way too long. I agree with all of that. My [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1299.8600000000001s)]
*  question to you was whether the Trump administration and whether you can and [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1304.74s)]
*  will do it. I'll just finish again with the question, whether you'll do it [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1310.42s)]
*  following judicial orders, following, as you said, the law and following [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1315.7s)]
*  whatever Supreme Court decisions are handed down in the coming weeks and [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1321.34s)]
*  months. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1325.94s)]
*  We will follow the law. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1328.1399999999999s)]
*  All right, borders are Tom Holman. Thank you so much. I hope that you and your [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1330.6399999999999s)]
*  family have a blessed Easter weekend and let us let us hope that in the coming [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1336.94s)]
*  weeks and months we can figure out a way to move forward and keep our border [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1343.4199999999998s)]
*  safe and do it in a way that more Americans are united over. Thank you for [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1347.7s)]
*  being with us this morning. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1354.18s)]
*  Happy Easter to you. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA6TaqLBMc&t=1357.1000000000001s)]
