# Trump describes D-Day as 'not a great day' to German chancellor
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4)
*  War between Ukraine and Russia, just one of the topics President Trump discussed with [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=0.0s)]
*  German Chancellor Friedrich Merz yesterday at the White House, with Merz urging Trump [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=4.76s)]
*  to increase pressure on Russia. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=9.52s)]
*  The German Chancellor also invoked D-Day as an example of another time the United States [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=11.48s)]
*  helped a European ground war, leading to this exchange. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=16.76s)]
*  And may I remind you that we are having June 6th tomorrow. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=21.96s)]
*  This is D-Day anniversary when the Americans once ended a war in Europe. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=26.16s)]
*  And I think this is in your hand in specific, in ours. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=33.64s)]
*  That was not a pleasant day for you? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=37.04s)]
*  No, that was not a pleasant. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=39.16s)]
*  Well, in the long run, Mr. President, this was the liberation of my country from Nazi [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=40.72s)]
*  dictatorship. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=46.68s)]
*  That's true. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=47.68s)]
*  And we know what we owe you. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=48.68s)]
*  But this is the reason why I'm saying that America is again in a very strong position [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=50.52s)]
*  to do something on this war and ending this war. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=56.24s)]
*  So let's talk about what we can do jointly. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=60.28s)]
*  John Meacham, today is the 81st anniversary of D-Day. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=64.2s)]
*  Americans and British and Canadian, Australian troops were on the beaches right now 81 years [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=67.76s)]
*  ago at the beginning of the liberation of Europe from the Nazis. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=73.0s)]
*  And you heard the German Chancellor yesterday effectively saying, Mr. President, you've [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  missed my point entirely with your one liner there. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=80.16s)]
*  I'm trying to explain to you why American influence is so critical today as it was 81 [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=82.72s)]
*  years ago on D-Day. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=89.36s)]
*  This is the hinge of the 20th century. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=92.36s)]
*  It's in many ways the moment, this operation that created a world that could be a post-war [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=94.52s)]
*  world. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=101.47999999999999s)]
*  I think it is a remarkable thing. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  I think David can shed more light on this than I can. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=103.47999999999999s)]
*  But that's a remarkable moment when the head of government of the former combatant nation, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=107.44s)]
*  Germany, would talk about that in terms of what we owe you for liberating us from Nazi [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=115.6s)]
*  dictatorship. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=123.28s)]
*  That's a moment where you really should step back just for a second. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=124.28s)]
*  And it's beyond Musk, and it's beyond tweets, and it's beyond the things that understandably [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=131.44s)]
*  consume us every day. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=138.24s)]
*  The images you're showing there are of ordinary Americans who, under Franklin Roosevelt, projected [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=141.28s)]
*  force across the Atlantic, across the Pacific as well, to stand against autocracy, to stand [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=149.92s)]
*  against totalitarianism in a way that, in an era not wholly unlike our own, it's important [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=157.48s)]
*  to remember, as Winston Churchill's alleged to have remarked, that you can always count [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=165.07999999999998s)]
*  on the Americans to do the right thing once we've exhausted every other possibility. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=170.28s)]
*  And World War II is arguably our greatest historical hour. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=175.88s)]
*  America, using its industrial might, using its moral might, sending its sons to foreign [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=182.4s)]
*  shores to stand up for the principles that were embodied in the Declaration of Independence [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=190.96s)]
*  and in the Atlantic Charter. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=196.8s)]
*  It's a marvelous story. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=198.72s)]
*  But let's remember that we got into World War II at the last possible moment. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=201.32s)]
*  It was after Pearl Harbor. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=208.24s)]
*  We were attacked in the Pacific, and then Franklin Roosevelt didn't send up a declaration [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=209.76s)]
*  of war until Hitler had declared war on us later that week in 1941. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=214.39999999999998s)]
*  And so politics, history, it seems black and white. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=221.67999999999998s)]
*  It seems simpler anyway. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=226.64s)]
*  It's not. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=230.0s)]
*  The men who began to turn the tide of the war to liberate Europe in these hours 81 years [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=232.2s)]
*  ago were doing something that makes our lives possible. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=240.44s)]
*  And I think that example should not—it's so overwhelming that it's almost as if it [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=246.35999999999999s)]
*  belongs to a different world. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=253.83999999999997s)]
*  But the reason I mention the complicated politics of the era is because they were human too. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=256.56s)]
*  They almost got it wrong, and then they got it right. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=264.0s)]
*  And that gives us, I think, hope. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=268.32s)]
*  So John is right. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=271.96s)]
*  D-Day, which we celebrate today, is a day on which the history of the modern world turned. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=275.72s)]
*  I thought it was very moving to have a German sitting next to President Trump yesterday. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=282.66s)]
*  I'm not sure Trump fully absorbed what he was saying, saying, you came to rescue us, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=286.86s)]
*  to rescue Germany, but to rescue the values of Europe and to allow the creation of a modern [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=292.66s)]
*  Europe. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=300.58000000000004s)]
*  I sat with Joe and others from Morning Joe at that graveyard in Normandy where the crosses, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=301.58000000000004s)]
*  the grave markers of all those thousands of Americans who died on D-Day are so visible. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=312.18s)]
*  And you can look at the cliff that they had to climb up to to get to the German positions, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=319.1s)]
*  that the heroism of the individual American, British, and other soldiers who on that day [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=324.90000000000003s)]
*  liberated Europe. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=331.62s)]
*  And I think if there's anything that the German Chancellor and other Europeans are [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=333.06s)]
*  trying to say today to President Trump and Americans is, don't forget this heritage. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=338.02s)]
*  You have been the people who came to the rescue when Europe was facing enormous danger from [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=344.06s)]
*  adversaries like Hitler, and Europeans would say today, like Vladimir Putin. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=352.38s)]
*  So it's a day to remember what America's done in the past, how grateful people are still [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=358.38s)]
*  for the sacrifices we made. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=363.62s)]
*  Yeah, and the Chancellor blowing through President Trump's one-liner there to say, no, no, what [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=366.3s)]
*  I'm saying is you have the power, just like you did on June 6, 1944, to rally to help [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=370.65999999999997s)]
*  a European nation. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=377.53999999999996s)]
*  You are still the United States of America, and Europe needs you. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=379.02s)]
*  The Washington Post, David Ignatius, historian John Meacham. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=381.9s)]
*  So great to have you both here, especially on this 81st anniversary of D-Day. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=386.26s)]
*  Thanks, guys. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X2Gm6z96p4&t=389.7s)]
