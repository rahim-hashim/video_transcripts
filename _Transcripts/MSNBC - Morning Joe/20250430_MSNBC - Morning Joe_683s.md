# Trump makes major concession in saying ‘I could’ get Kilmar Abrego Garcia back from El Salvador
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU)
*  But we begin with new comments from President Trump defending his administration's decision [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=0.0s)]
*  to send a Maryland man to a prison in El Salvador. In an interview with ABC News yesterday, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=5.92s)]
*  the president was asked about the wrongful removal of Kilmar Abrego Garcia from the United States. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=12.96s)]
*  The president denied any mistake was made and dodged questions about [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  following the Supreme Court's order to facilitate his return. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=24.72s)]
*  Well, the lawyer that said it was a mistake was here a long time, was not appointed by us. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=30.0s)]
*  Should not have said that. Should not have said that. And just so you understand, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=36.24s)]
*  the person that you're talking about, you know, you're making this person sound, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=40.32s)]
*  this is a MS-13 gang member, a tough cookie, been in lots of skirmishes, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=43.76s)]
*  beat the hell out of his wife, and the wife was petrified to even talk about him, okay? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=49.92s)]
*  This is not an innocent, wonderful gentleman from Maryland. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=54.879999999999995s)]
*  I'm not saying he's a good guy. It's about the rule of law. The order from the Supreme Court stands, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=57.92s)]
*  sir. You came into our country illegally. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=62.32000000000001s)]
*  You could get him back. There's a phone on this desk. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  I could. You could pick it up and with all the power of the presidency, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=66.64s)]
*  you could call up the president of El Salvador and say, send him back right now. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=69.68s)]
*  And if he were the gentleman that you say he is, I would do that. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=72.80000000000001s)]
*  But the court has ordered you to facilitate that release. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=76.16s)]
*  I'm not the one making this decision. We have lawyers that don't want to do this. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  You're the president. But the buck stops in his office. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=83.2s)]
*  No, no, no, no. I follow the law. You want me to follow the law. If I were the president that [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=85.04s)]
*  just wanted to do anything, I'd probably keep him right where he is. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=90.16000000000001s)]
*  The law is saying something different. The president also got into a heated exchange [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  about whether Abrego Garcia is a gang member, claiming Abrego Garcia has the tattoos to prove it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=99.36000000000001s)]
*  Even the man that you picked out, he said he wasn't a member of a gang. And then they looked, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=108.56s)]
*  on his knuckles, he had MS-13. There's a dispute. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=114.80000000000001s)]
*  Wait a minute. Wait a minute. He had MS-13 on his knuckles tattoo. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=118.0s)]
*  He had some tattoos that are interpreted that way. But let's move on. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=122.72s)]
*  Wait a minute. Hey, Terry, Terry, Terry. He did not have the letter MS-13. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=125.44000000000001s)]
*  It says MS-13. That was photoshopped. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=130.08s)]
*  So let me just- That was photoshopped. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=133.36s)]
*  Terry, you can do that. Hey, they're giving you the big break of a lifetime. You know, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=134.72s)]
*  you're doing the interview. I picked you because, frankly, I never heard of you, but that's okay. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=138.56s)]
*  And I picked you, Terry, but you're not being very nice. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=142.88s)]
*  Last week, President Trump posted this photo on Truth Social, claiming this is the knuckle of [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=147.68s)]
*  Abrego Garcia. But the words MS-13 are photoshopped onto the image. The actual tattoos [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=155.12s)]
*  are of various symbols. Where do we begin with this? I mean, on a number of levels. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  And, Danny, we have questions for you about this specific case. But, you know, Willie, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=170.88s)]
*  he's been moved. Abrego Garcia has been moved to another prison. He's been sent to a prison [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=178.32000000000002s)]
*  in El Salvador. He's moved from the notorious prison to another one. And there's still several [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=182.16s)]
*  hundred other people who didn't get due process, who are in the most miserable place on earth, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=187.12s)]
*  as it's described. And the president is just letting them all just hang there. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=195.6s)]
*  And no less than the Supreme Court, as Terry Moran pointed out, has ordered the president to [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=202.48s)]
*  facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia. That's as high up as you can go. And yet he says, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=206.79999999999998s)]
*  I'm following the law. The lawyers have said I can't do this. I believe I've heard that the [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=212.32s)]
*  president doesn't like the idea that that's out there, that he's too weak to bring back. Remember, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=218.56s)]
*  they've said, well, we can't. Now that he's in El Salvador, the Justice Department said there's [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=224.32s)]
*  nothing we can do. Well, of course he could. He's Donald Trump. He's the president of the United [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=227.76s)]
*  States. He could call because obviously he has the president of El Salvador under his thumb and say, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=231.12s)]
*  send him back. It's just that he doesn't want to get him back. I think politically there would be [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=235.44s)]
*  value in bringing him back. But, Danny, let's get to the legality of all this. First of all, Abrego [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=240.23999999999998s)]
*  Garcia, is the president following the law? Probably not. And I've been in that camp of [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=244.95999999999998s)]
*  not ready to declare constitutional crisis yet. I have been a staunch, I've been committed to [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=251.76000000000002s)]
*  the idea that I'm not ready to say that until and unless the president says, I have an order [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=257.92s)]
*  and I am openly defying it. And after this interview, there's not a lot of wiggle room [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=263.28000000000003s)]
*  left for the president because he said he conceded in a very smart question and answer, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=268.48s)]
*  designed to get that exact answer. I could pick up the phone and return him right now. The Supreme [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=274.32s)]
*  Court has ordered more specifically the Maryland District Court has ordered that the president or [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=279.6s)]
*  the administration facilitate Abrego Garcia's return. But I want to be clear, it's not his [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=284.32000000000005s)]
*  return forever and ever, happily ever after. Understood. We need to be realistic about this. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=290.16s)]
*  If the administration wants to remove Kilmar Abrego Garcia, in the end, the odds are it will be able [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=295.12s)]
*  to. The only thing the Supreme Court and the District Court has ordered is that he be returned [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=301.44s)]
*  as if he was not removed in this improper way. So what the administration could do is just bring [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=306.08s)]
*  him back, give him what we call due process. And people have been talking a lot about due process, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=311.44s)]
*  like it's a magic talisman. The reality is, and as a criminal defense attorney, I think a lot of [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=316.88s)]
*  criminal defense attorneys would agree that due process is a nice thing, but a lot of times it [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=321.52s)]
*  doesn't change the inevitable outcome of a case. So if they bring him back, they give him due process, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=326.08s)]
*  they go to the court, they try to get rid of this withholding of removal order, they might be able [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=332.0s)]
*  to do it, and he might be right back where the administration wanted him in the first place. But [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=336.64s)]
*  as it stands now, and Trump rarely shows a knowledge of the legal, he has like sort of a [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=341.6s)]
*  surface knowledge of what's going on legally. And he says immediately after he says that I could [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=347.2s)]
*  bring him back, that I'm going to follow the law or something to that effect. But that may be exactly [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=352.56s)]
*  what he's not doing if he concedes that he's able to bring him back. And what's been going on is [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=357.2s)]
*  cat and mouse game between presidents where one president says, I can't send him back to the United [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=362.64s)]
*  States. What am I going to do? Smuggle him in? And then our president says, well, I don't have any [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=367.91999999999996s)]
*  control over it. But now he's just said, oh yeah, I do have control over it. You better believe [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=371.91999999999996s)]
*  that Kilmar Abrego Garcia's attorneys are going to get the transcript of that interview and shove [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=377.35999999999996s)]
*  it in front of the judge as fast as they can. This is a major concession by the administration. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=382.88s)]
*  And there's sort of these competing impulses on display here from Trump, who at times sort of acts [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=388.4s)]
*  almost as an observer to his own presidency. We saw that the first time. We see it now too, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=392.88s)]
*  where he kind of comments along with things often on social media without realizing, hey, you're the [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=396.56s)]
*  one who actually could do something about it. Like, hey, inflation's bad. Okay, do something about it. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=400.71999999999997s)]
*  And there are many other examples. With this, Danny, as you rightly say, this is his hatred of [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=404.79999999999995s)]
*  the idea of weakness. So with this now out there in the public realm, this comment, not just, let's [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=409.28s)]
*  not just talk about this particular individual. There's dozens of people taken from the United [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=414.32s)]
*  States without the due process whose names we don't know yet because the administration hasn't [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=420.56s)]
*  even revealed them. So talk to us about just like a bigger template here for others who are trying [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=425.04s)]
*  to say, look, you know, this was not done in an appropriate fashion. Yeah, the Trump administration [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=429.52s)]
*  is removing people with ruthless efficiency. Let me just give you an example. The habeas petitions [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=434.64s)]
*  are the petitions that people are filing to challenge their detention. The rules for this [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=439.68s)]
*  kind of petition are that it has to be filed in the place where you're being detained. One thing [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=444.08s)]
*  they've been doing is transferring people so quickly that they don't have a chance to file that [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=448.32s)]
*  petition. And in some cases, they're already out of the country. So where is the jurisdiction [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=452.64s)]
*  once they're out of the country? And once they're out of the country, the administration takes the [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=458.08s)]
*  position that, hey, it's no longer our problem. So one of the things that Trump administration [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=461.6s)]
*  has been unbelievably good at in the last few weeks and months is finding legal ways to achieve [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=466.8s)]
*  what it wants, ways that are often parts of a subsection of a statute that no one has ever [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=473.44s)]
*  really used before. I mean, for example, the provision of federal law that allows removal [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=479.04s)]
*  or removal of people who the secretary of state deems would have adverse foreign policy consequences. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=484.8s)]
*  When Congress passed that legislation, they said, hey, listen, this is supposed to be used rarely. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=490.72s)]
*  This is not supposed to be used all the time for people that you just don't want in the country. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=495.84s)]
*  It's for a situation where some foreign visitor is causing a major foreign policy crisis, not just [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=500.15999999999997s)]
*  because you don't like the guy or you don't like what he or she is saying. So one of the things [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=506.71999999999997s)]
*  the Trump administration is doing very well with ruthless efficiency is finding legal means or at [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=510.4s)]
*  least legal basis to do the things that it wants to do and at least argue that in court. But they may [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=516.9599999999999s)]
*  be coming to the end of the road in the Garcia case. And by the way, in a way, it's an unforced [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=522.88s)]
*  error because as I said before, they could just bring him back, put him through some kind of due [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=527.28s)]
*  process. And if the administration really wants, they probably get that withholding of removal [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=531.92s)]
*  order overturned and send him back exactly where they want to send. As Donald Trump conceded, the [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=536.8s)]
*  president saying, of course I can get him back. I'll pick up that phone and make a phone call. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=541.68s)]
*  David French, you've been writing a lot about the Abrego Garcia case and the absence of due process [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=545.2s)]
*  here. One comment that the president made in that interview yesterday with Terry Moran was that we [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=550.32s)]
*  can't have hearings for everyone who's in the country illegally. There'd be 10, 11 million [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00JLifjvWBU&t=556.96s)]
