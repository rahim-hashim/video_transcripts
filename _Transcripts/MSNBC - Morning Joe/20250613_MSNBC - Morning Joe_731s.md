# Israel launches major attack on Iran, striking nuclear sites and killing top commanders
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA)
*  Good morning to you all. Let's get right to the breaking news out of the Middle East. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel's military says Iran launched more than 100 drones targeting Israel after the Israelis [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  carried out what it called a precise and coordinated preemptive strike targeting Iran's nuclear [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=10.0s)]
*  program. Israel's defense forces say its opening wave of attacks hit dozens of military installations, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  including nuclear sites across multiple regions in Iran, killing Iran's most senior military [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=21.76s)]
*  official and two other leaders. Now, Iranian state media is reporting a new round of Israeli [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=29.04s)]
*  strikes near an air base and an airport. In a video message posted to social media, Israel's [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  military chief said the operation was launched because, quote, Israel could not wait another [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=40.32s)]
*  moment to act. In Washington, Secretary of State Marco Rubio described Israel's strikes as [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=45.599999999999994s)]
*  unilateral, emphasizing the United States is not involved. He added the Trump administration has [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=51.28s)]
*  taken steps to protect American forces and remains in close contacts with regional allies. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=57.44s)]
*  Secretary Rubio concluded his statement warning Iran, quote, let me be clear, Iran should not [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=64.0s)]
*  target U.S. interests or personnel. Let's bring in NBC News chief international correspondent [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=70.48s)]
*  Keir Simmons live this morning in Dubai. Keir, what more can you tell us about the latest on these [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=75.75999999999999s)]
*  strikes? Well, this does look like the most substantial attack by Israel against Iran. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=80.88s)]
*  They are talking about 200 Israeli aircraft involved in the attacks, releasing videos of [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  strikes on Iranian defenses that were happening simultaneously as these munitions rained down, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=96.24s)]
*  not just on Tehran, the capital, though many, many sites there in Tehran, but also around the country, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  more than 10 locations were hit. And according to the Israelis and according to the Iranians, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=109.04s)]
*  there were strikes on military bases as well as nuclear facilities, as well as military [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=115.92s)]
*  leaders, as you mentioned. The head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, for example, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=124.64s)]
*  killed in these, in this, what it looks like now is a first wave of attacks. There are images of [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  thick black smoke rising from the Natanz nuclear facility and an Iranian state reporter appears in [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=137.76s)]
*  front of it a few hours later to say that the attack happened around 4.15 in the morning Iranian [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=144.23999999999998s)]
*  time. There are images of really suburban locations, apartment buildings in flames at night [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=151.12s)]
*  and then still burning in the daytime. The Israelis are talking about this as an attack on the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=157.68s)]
*  existential threat from Iran. So implicitly, not simply Iran's nuclear capability, but its entire [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=166.64s)]
*  infrastructure, its entire military infrastructure, its ability to threaten Israel, if you like. As you [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=175.6s)]
*  mentioned, we then got reports just in recent hours of around more than 100 UAVs, drones from Iran [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  heading towards Israel. The Israelis say that they have stopped many of those. It's not clear how [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=190.64s)]
*  many might be still heading Israel's way. They do take some time to arrive there. And then the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=196.32s)]
*  other aspect of this, of course, is that simply hours before this took place, President Trump was [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=202.0s)]
*  indicating that he still wanted the Iran nuclear issue to be addressed by diplomatic means, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=208.72s)]
*  while indicating that the U.S. was aware that this strike would take place. He all but urged Israel [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=216.64s)]
*  not to do this. There are going to be more attacks. That's quite clear. We're hearing, as you [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=224.72s)]
*  mentioned now, of another wave from Israel, Prime Minister Netanyahu being clear that this is part [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=230.4s)]
*  of an ongoing operation, not just an overnight one-off. And just to set the table a little bit, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=236.96s)]
*  I guess, Woody, the question has always been, when this has been talked about, is whether Israel has [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=243.44s)]
*  the capability to take out, if you like, Iran's nuclear facilities, Iran's nuclear program [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=249.76s)]
*  comprehensively enough to stop it, or whether that would need the support of the U.S., [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=257.84s)]
*  particularly U.S. munitions, and whether an attack like this would prompt Iran to, if you like, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=265.03999999999996s)]
*  race towards nuclear capability. Those questions are all still out there as we look at these images [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=270.56s)]
*  of multiple places in Iran burning today. Keir, stay with us. I want to turn to David Ignatius [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=276.64s)]
*  as well. David, obviously this was a targeted attack on, as Keir says, the nuclear program, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=283.28s)]
*  top two nuclear scientists killed, Israel says, in these attacks, but also on the military [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=289.36s)]
*  leadership of the IRGC, the commander in chief, another top leader of the IRGC taken out in this [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=294.56s)]
*  strike as well. This is something that had been sort of signaled for the last couple of days. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=300.71999999999997s)]
*  People were talking about this and how the United States would handle it, distancing itself, at [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=306.08s)]
*  least rhetorically, saying the United States had nothing to do with this. What do you take away from [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=310.08s)]
*  what we know so far about these strikes? So, Willie, what strikes me initially when we have [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=315.68s)]
*  such limited information is that this looks like a decapitation strike against Iran, similar to the [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=322.32s)]
*  decapitation of Hezbollah in Lebanon, where there's a deliberate attempt to target and assassinate the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=330.08s)]
*  senior leadership. The top three military officials appear to have been killed. If you look at the [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=338.08s)]
*  photos and video that we have, you can see very precise targeting. Certain floors of buildings, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=345.84s)]
*  but not the building as a whole, have been hit, indicating very precise intelligence. There are [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=352.08s)]
*  also reports that Iran was using drones brought into Iran to be as precise as possible, not [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=356.96s)]
*  ballistic missile or aircraft strikes. The second thing that strikes me is that the United States [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=367.59999999999997s)]
*  position so far is not what I've ever seen in any conflict that involves Israel to this degree with [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=375.12s)]
*  Iran or other adversaries. The United States is standing back, is saying this is Israel's [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=382.48s)]
*  unilateral action, seems still interested in having a diplomatic meeting, Steve Wittkopf meeting [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=388.88s)]
*  on Sunday in Oman with the Iranian foreign minister. So, it does still seem as if President Trump hopes [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=396.56s)]
*  that he can pull from this conflict some kind of nuclear agreement with Iran. That seems increasingly [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=404.88s)]
*  likely to me as the death toll rises. And a final point I'd make, so far in these early hours, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=412.88s)]
*  the Iranian response has been fairly limited. Israel had hoped that its previous attacks had so [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=419.91999999999996s)]
*  destroyed Iran's base of air defense and ballistic missiles that its ability to retaliate [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=426.79999999999995s)]
*  would be limited. We may be watching that, and as we see 200 Israeli planes go in for what it [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=433.2s)]
*  described as five different waves of sorties over Tehran and other cities, it may be that the [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=439.68s)]
*  Iranian air defenses have in fact been compromised so severely by Israel that Israel can operate [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=448.08s)]
*  it well. Yeah, Iran's military may be compromised also now its leadership apparently decimated, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=454.08s)]
*  so maybe leading to some confusion there in Tehran as to what to do for a response. We know that [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=459.36s)]
*  President Trump did not want this. He warned off Prime Minister Netanyahu back in April when [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=464.24s)]
*  Israel was planning an attack then. Israel listened. He has in recent weeks still been [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=469.52000000000004s)]
*  pushing a diplomatic solution. We're told Prime Minister Netanyahu told President Trump when they [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=474.96000000000004s)]
*  had a call on Monday that an attack was possible. That's in part why the U.S. moved personnel out [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=480.0s)]
*  of the region in anticipation of a response. And that, as David just noted, the Secretary of State's [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=486.08000000000004s)]
*  statement made clear that this was Israel's decision. There's a unilateral move. And we just [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=493.44s)]
*  now have heard from President Trump for the first time. Last night after the attack happened, he left [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=499.28s)]
*  the congressional picnic early at the White House, met with national security officials. He's just [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=503.92s)]
*  taking a true social just a couple moments ago. It is a very Iran-focused post. I'll read a little [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=508.16s)]
*  bit of it. I gave Iran chance after chance to make a deal. I told them in the strongest of words to [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=512.72s)]
*  just do it. But no matter how hard they tried, no matter how close they got, they just couldn't get [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=517.44s)]
*  it done. I told them that it would be much worse than they knew, anticipated or were told, that the [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=521.44s)]
*  United States makes the best military equipment in the world and Israel has a lot of it. Certain [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=526.5600000000001s)]
*  Iranian hardliners, he goes on to say, spoke bravely, but they didn't know what was about to happen. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=532.08s)]
*  They are all dead now and it will only get worse. And then he goes on to say that even after this [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=537.36s)]
*  attack, that bigger attacks are coming, more brutal, in his words, more brutal attacks, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=542.48s)]
*  presumably from Israel, are coming and that Iran should make a deal before they happen. So Richard, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=548.48s)]
*  the President of the United States here is still pushing for a diplomatic solution to this. I don't [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=553.6s)]
*  know how likely that is now in the wake of what we saw last night. But start by talking to us about [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=558.8000000000001s)]
*  that relationship. The sort of, I mean, Prime Minister Netanyahu did not listen to President [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=563.28s)]
*  Trump. It would appear in these attacks. At the same time, it does sort of defy belief that Israel [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=567.12s)]
*  would just do this almost on its own without at least some sort of blessing from the U.S. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=573.28s)]
*  It's not clear whether they got it. And I guess as part of that, when we're all going to be watching, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=578.16s)]
*  when Iran does hit back, does the U.S. actively participate in Israel's defense as it has in the [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=583.36s)]
*  past? Well, a couple of things. Let's just unpack this a little bit. Israel described this as a [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=588.7199999999999s)]
*  quote unquote preemptive strike on Iran. It was not. This is a preventive strike. Big difference [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=593.52s)]
*  under international law, diplomacy. This was against a gathering Iranian threat. There was no [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=598.9599999999999s)]
*  imminent plan for Iran, say, to launch anything nuclear against Israel if they don't have that [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=604.0s)]
*  capacity. Let's just put this in context. Second of all, Israel clearly gave the United States a [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=607.92s)]
*  heads up. And what seems to me, Jonathan, is the United States acquiesced. Look, I've been in [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=613.68s)]
*  government when we've given Israel red lights. I've been in government when we gave Israel yellow [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=618.0s)]
*  lights or green lights. This was somewhere between a yellow and a green light in the sense when the [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=622.24s)]
*  United States says we're going to withdraw our personnel from the region and so forth. There was [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=626.96s)]
*  no red light here. So again, Israel acted on its own. But the United States essentially said if you [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=631.36s)]
*  want to do this, it's one way or another. We were saying it's OK by us if you do this. If President [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=636.72s)]
*  Trump wanted to have stopped this attack, he could have. It's that simple, given the importance of [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=642.5600000000001s)]
*  the U.S. relationship to Israel. The idea that now you could get diplomacy restarted, I think, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=647.6s)]
*  is fanciful. I think it's fanciful. I think what the Iranians are going to do in the short run is [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=653.04s)]
*  various types of retaliation. The drone thing is small. I think the most interesting thing is [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=657.84s)]
*  whether they go regional, whether they go against, for example, some of the Arab countries or something [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=663.0400000000001s)]
*  like that. I don't know. Whether they do terrorism. They've also got time on their side. As we've seen [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=668.1600000000001s)]
*  in the past, Iranian retaliation doesn't have to be instant. The other big issue is whether they [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=673.5200000000001s)]
*  try to reconstitute their nuclear program much more underground. One of the big Iranian facilities [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=678.72s)]
*  seems to have been left out of the Israeli attack, as best I know, which is Fordow. That's one of the [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=684.64s)]
*  two places where the Iranians produce and store enriched uranium deep, deep, deep underground. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1VtsMhAAA&t=689.12s)]
