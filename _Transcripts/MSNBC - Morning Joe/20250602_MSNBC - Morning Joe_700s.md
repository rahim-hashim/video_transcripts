# 'Has to be stopped': Governor slams 'reprehensible' ICE raids in her state
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI)
*  Switching gears now, New York Governor Kathy Hilgel and House Democratic leader [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=0.0s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries rallied against Republicans' steep federal health care [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=3.92s)]
*  cuts in Brooklyn yesterday. The pair say that the GOP's quote one big ugly bill [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=8.4s)]
*  will have major consequences for patients and health care providers. The [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=13.66s)]
*  governor's office estimates the bill will leave 1.5 million New Yorkers [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=17.84s)]
*  uninsured and will devastate hospitals and clinics statewide. And let's now [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=22.16s)]
*  indeed bring in New York's Democratic Governor Kathy Hilgel. Mike Barticle, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=27.52s)]
*  always happy to have the governor here. Always, always, always a joy to see you. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=32.04s)]
*  Thank you Mike. Dealing with the federal government as you do nearly every single [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=37.12s)]
*  day, the role of the federal government in New York State is obviously enormous. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=41.12s)]
*  What happens when the federal government tries to intervene with [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=44.84s)]
*  people's rights to walk along a sidewalk because they assume that they may be [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=50.56s)]
*  Middle Eastern, they may be not from this country, they may not have visa rights. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=55.88s)]
*  So masked people jump out of these huge SUVs and apprehend people who are here [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=60.6s)]
*  legally. Is there any role for New York State or any role for the governor of [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=67.08s)]
*  the of the state of New York to intervene here to do anything about that? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=71.36s)]
*  Let me just get back to what Jonathan says. I feel like we're under attack [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=75.76s)]
*  every single day by the federal government. You just mentioned the fact [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=79.2s)]
*  that we can't develop vaccinations. I mean we are always the place where the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=82.84s)]
*  vaccination spread the quickest. We're a very dense city and I want to make sure [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=87.68s)]
*  they're developing vaccinations. And I want my three-year-old granddaughter to [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=91.4s)]
*  be able to get a COVID shot and my pregnant daughter to get a COVID shot. So [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=95.08s)]
*  my number one job as governor is to protect people. So now you're [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  undermining our ability to make sure they're healthy with just preventative [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=103.12s)]
*  care and now you're attacking people walking down the streets of New York City. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=106.2s)]
*  I have said this before and I'll repeat it forever. The state of New York will [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=110.64s)]
*  assist ICE in the deportation and apprehension of people who are serious [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=116.96s)]
*  criminals, violent offenders. None of us want them on our streets. But now you're [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=122.03999999999999s)]
*  going after individuals not just on the streets of New York City, Mike. They took [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=128.28s)]
*  a third grader out of her bed at 6 a.m. in Sacketts Harbor which is Tom [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=132.4s)]
*  Holman's hometown. Her dad was already milking cows at 6 a.m. They took her, her [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=137.88000000000002s)]
*  mother and her teenage twin brothers, scooped them up and dumped them in an [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=144.08s)]
*  detention center for 11 days. I raised hell. How dare you do this? And this is [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=149.24s)]
*  the most Republican part of our state. It's Elise Defonox district and the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=155.28s)]
*  Republican farmer, literally it's called Old McDonald's Farm. It's been there for [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=159.8s)]
*  five generations. They were shocked. This community rallied behind this hard [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=163.6s)]
*  working immigrant family. So that's what's happening not just here in New [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=167.88s)]
*  York but on farms all over New York and it is debilitating for our farm [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=172.0s)]
*  community and people who just want to live their lives. They run our bodegas, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=177.44s)]
*  they work in our restaurants, they provide health care, home health care [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=181.48s)]
*  aides to our seniors. The hospitals I was in yesterday. This is a place for [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=185.92s)]
*  so many of them work and I think it's just so reprehensible that this is the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=190.68s)]
*  exact opposite of what Republicans and Donald Trump said they would do. We're [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=196.56s)]
*  going after the worst of the worst. You know the bad guys and they are not [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=201.0s)]
*  doing that. They're going after students. They're going after high school [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=206.32s)]
*  students. So this has reached a scale where there's not a lot we can do [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=209.64000000000001s)]
*  personally. I can't stand in front of them and stop them but I can use my [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=215.04000000000002s)]
*  voice, my platform and call them out and continue to call on the seven [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=218.76s)]
*  Republicans who occupy seats in the state of New York and say where are you? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=223.39999999999998s)]
*  Use your voice. You're in the majority. Stop advocating your responsibility [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=228.35999999999999s)]
*  when it comes to stopping the decimate, decimating Medicaid, Medicare. So I'm [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=233.2s)]
*  very frustrated with this. I'm fighting all the time. I'm on the front lines [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=240.95999999999998s)]
*  with Akeem Jeffries as we were yesterday but this is a level of attack [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=244.8s)]
*  that is unforeseeable but it has to be stopped and we have to raise our [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=249.88000000000002s)]
*  voices louder and louder. Why don't we Governor, why don't we talk about what's [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=256.56s)]
*  happening right now and I'm so glad you talked about a farm in upstate New York [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=263.32s)]
*  because it shows. You have people that are constantly trying to divide New [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=268.0s)]
*  York from Iowa, from you know Arizona, from California acting like there's a [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=273.6s)]
*  red state America and a blue state America. When you're talking about [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=279.6s)]
*  health care and you're talking about slashing Medicaid, as Joni Ernst found [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=283.04s)]
*  out in her town hall meeting which she responded terribly to and as many of [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=290.08000000000004s)]
*  these Republicans in upstate New York are going to find out, Medicaid is not [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=296.04s)]
*  just for people in urban centers in America, for big city hospitals. In fact [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=302.0s)]
*  it's rural hospitals who are getting damaged disproportionately. Talk about [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=308.56s)]
*  the dangers, whether you're talking about Joni Ernst's constituents in Iowa or [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=314.79999999999995s)]
*  your constituents in upstate New York. Talk about the impact of these Medicaid [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=320.71999999999997s)]
*  cuts. Joe you know upstate New York as well because your formative years were [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=326.92s)]
*  sent in our southern tier. That is literally, technically Appalachia. I would [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=332.72s)]
*  march in my old congressional district. I represented the most Republican [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=337.12s)]
*  district in the state of New York, the most rural. I was in those neighborhoods [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=340.52000000000004s)]
*  and those communities where people said not only have they never voted for a [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=344.36s)]
*  Democrat, they've never seen a Democrat. So that's part of New York State. So the [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=347.68s)]
*  largest employer in most of my counties was the county hospital and as governor [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=352.8s)]
*  I've spent enormous amount of money just propped them up because they don't have [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=358.52000000000004s)]
*  the money. They shut down. It's not just going to hurt people on Medicaid, it's [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=362.0s)]
*  going to hurt everybody because they won't be there for you. When your child [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=368.36s)]
*  gets sick they will not be there and I lost my seat in Congress because I voted [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=371.88s)]
*  for the Affordable Care Act. Many of us lost our seats at that time and I would [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=377.04s)]
*  do it all over again because I knew there was people in that district still [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=380.96s)]
*  needed this coverage even though it seems they vote against their interests [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=384.96s)]
*  sometimes. But I'll continue fighting to make sure their voices are lifted up. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=388.32s)]
*  It's not just an urban problem. It is all over this country and our state in [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=393.24s)]
*  particular and if we lose three billion dollars for hospitals I can't say we're [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=398.24s)]
*  going to be able to keep all of my hospitals open. I cannot say that right [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=403.76s)]
*  now. They have to back off and what they're proposing is basically reverse [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=407.28s)]
*  Robin Hood. They're taking from the poor to give to the rich and people need to [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=413.28s)]
*  rebel against that and we have seven Republicans. All it took Joe and Mika, it [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=419.78s)]
*  was one of them. One of them could have cast a different vote on behalf of their [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=424.76s)]
*  constituents. The people who rely on these hospitals, who rely on Medicaid [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=428.88s)]
*  because their grandma's in the nursing home or their kids are, one out of half [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=433.52s)]
*  of all kids in New York State are on Medicaid because they're looking out for [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=438.71999999999997s)]
*  children and none of them had the courage to do it. They didn't have the [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=441.91999999999996s)]
*  guts to stand up and do what was right in their own districts and there will be [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=445.59999999999997s)]
*  consequences next year I assure you. Well and and and and Jonathan Amir, that's [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=450.2s)]
*  what's so important for people to understand that I don't understand why [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=456.44s)]
*  Republicans, whether it's in New York State or Iowa, don't understand this. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=460.08s)]
*  Whether you're talking about Elise Stefanik's district in in upstate New [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=464.24s)]
*  York or as the governor said where I grew up in between Elmira and and [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=469.68s)]
*  Corning, New York and beautiful downtown Big Flats, New York. These are all areas, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=475.84s)]
*  Elmira especially, but these are all areas that depend on Medicaid and and [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=481.91999999999996s)]
*  you get out the Painted Post outside of Corning or you go in rural Iowa. As the [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=489.08s)]
*  governor said, a huge percentage of children get their primary care from [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=496.15999999999997s)]
*  Medicaid. A huge percentage of seniors get their get their health care and [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=504.36s)]
*  nursing home care from Medicaid. So those cuts don't just impact New York [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=510.96s)]
*  State, they impact Iowa, they impact all 50 states and Republicans are just [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=516.96s)]
*  barreling towards these cuts while again, let's say it again, adding 20 trillion [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=523.4000000000001s)]
*  dollars to the national debt. Yeah and and we see how defensive they are. We [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=529.36s)]
*  played the clip from Speaker Johnson earlier in the show and of course Senator [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=534.84s)]
*  Ernst in extraordinarily tone-deaf moment there at the town hall. So [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=539.0400000000001s)]
*  governor I wanted to end by asking about your the relationship between the [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=543.28s)]
*  federal government and New York State in particular the President of the United [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=546.92s)]
*  States who is a New Yorker by birth even if he doesn't really call it at home [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=550.12s)]
*  anymore. You have been able to work with him on a few things. You mentioned a [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=554.04s)]
*  wind farm that you've been able to save. There's new development around Penn [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=557.48s)]
*  Station and the Port Authority, but at the same time really sort of had to [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=560.52s)]
*  clash with him on a few things including congestion pricing where they have tried [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=564.52s)]
*  to meddle with what you say is a local issue. So how would you assess this [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_94kMIdvMI&t=568.36s)]
