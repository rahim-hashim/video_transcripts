# Trump is falling in the polls, but why aren't Democrats benefiting?
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0)
*  In your latest piece titled, Trump's Falling in Polls, Why Aren't Democrats Benefiting, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=0.0s)]
*  you write this, Democratic leaders love talking about the president's flagging poll numbers. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=4.96s)]
*  Their own numbers? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=9.6s)]
*  Not so much. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=10.6s)]
*  The easiest answer to the Democrats' problems is the one reporters enjoy the least. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=11.6s)]
*  It's early. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=15.700000000000001s)]
*  Most voters rejected Democrats last year, and they're not looking at politics again [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=16.7s)]
*  until they really have to. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=20.48s)]
*  But why are Democrats less popular now than they usually are after defeats, and why are [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=21.84s)]
*  Republicans holding onto most of their 2024 support? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=26.28s)]
*  One reason, suggested by the actual special election results so far, is that some of the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=30.040000000000003s)]
*  anti-democratic negativity is from people who will vote for the party anyway. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=34.84s)]
*  Another reason is a long-term shift against the party that's been visible in voter registration [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=39.84s)]
*  patterns for eight years. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=44.28s)]
*  At this point in 2017, Democrats still outnumbered registered Republicans in Florida. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=46.1s)]
*  Republicans now hold a 1.2 million voter advantage. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=52.040000000000006s)]
*  We talked about that poll that was out last week that showed the president with only 37% [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=55.760000000000005s)]
*  approval rating, but when you look down, Democrats had a 30% approval rating. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=61.800000000000004s)]
*  That's the ABC News Washington Post poll from last week. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=66.12s)]
*  We've asked Democratic leaders on this show how they explain that number, and there really [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=69.12s)]
*  actually hasn't been a great answer so far. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=74.92s)]
*  There really hasn't. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  Everyone has tried. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=79.24000000000001s)]
*  Democrats keep describing these poll numbers in Trump support almost like a lever. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  He's going to go down, we're going to come up. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=84.84s)]
*  They haven't come up. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=86.80000000000001s)]
*  Their own polling, I talked to Navigator Research, which does a lot of polling for Democrats, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=87.80000000000001s)]
*  helping with their messaging. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=92.56s)]
*  Their analysis is just that 74% of the country and their numbers doesn't like the political [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  system, wants to change it completely. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=99.08000000000001s)]
*  The rest of the electorate, which is smaller than even that Democratic chair you pointed [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=101.92000000000002s)]
*  out there, says you can make changes to it. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=105.44000000000001s)]
*  This AOC conversation you were just having leads into that. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  The party is still seen as protecting a sort of system, a sort of set of norms that are [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=111.96s)]
*  not that popular. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=118.11999999999999s)]
*  You find this talking to voters who are not, as I said in that piece, not that engaged [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=119.63999999999999s)]
*  with politics yet. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=122.96s)]
*  As unpopular as coverage of the tariffs has been, as unpopular as the tariffs has been [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=124.47999999999999s)]
*  with people who are trying to build things in America, there's still this impression [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=127.72s)]
*  you hear from a lot of voters, or I guess a lot of people who might vote, that Trump [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=132.42s)]
*  is trying something different. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=136.72s)]
*  Maybe it'll work. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=137.72s)]
*  Maybe it'll bring factories back home. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=138.72s)]
*  There is still a bias in the electorate towards trying something new against defending the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=142.48s)]
*  norms and the people who set those norms up. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=146.84s)]
*  So, Dave, off of your reporting here and getting back to Donald Trump, who you just mentioned, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=149.28s)]
*  how is it that the Democrats seemingly have no idea of how strong Trump is in people's [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=155.36s)]
*  lives compared to them? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=161.8s)]
*  They feel that Democrats just simply do not know them. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=163.32s)]
*  They don't know, Democrats don't know people who go shopping, who have kids in elementary [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=166.56s)]
*  school, who pay pump prices at the gas station that are ridiculous to them, that have a tough [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=172.52s)]
*  time making a living, and yet they still think that Democrats don't know me. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=178.4s)]
*  How does that happen to a party? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=184.04000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that's another part of this data that says that Democrats have lost their lead on [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  which party identifies people like you, fights people like you, everything you were saying. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=190.88s)]
*  A number of reasons for that. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=195.0s)]
*  One, historically, the party is seen as redistribution, not oriented towards success, and that got [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=197.0s)]
*  worse after COVID. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=204.28s)]
*  The party still has this hangover from the COVID spending that was popular at the time [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=205.28s)]
*  that Trump took credit for, the idea that it is giving money to people who are not working. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=209.48000000000002s)]
*  It has a number of problems with the way that Trump economy is sold, the way that they are [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=215.08s)]
*  responding to it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=221.76s)]
*  Again, I don't want to repeat myself talking about the tariffs, but Democrats keep trying [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=222.76s)]
*  to change the conversation to Medicaid, to Medicare, to the things they're most safe [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=227.88s)]
*  on, defending entitlements the way they are, and Republicans are not giving them much breathing [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=231.16s)]
*  room, too. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=235.44s)]
*  Republicans are being smart here, too, not just Trump, in not really talking about how [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=236.44s)]
*  they want to change Medicaid and Medicare, and talking only about giving more benefits [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=239.04s)]
*  to people, only about cutting taxes on TIFs. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=242.72s)]
*  This is part of the story. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=245.39999999999998s)]
*  Democrats are not taking every advantage, but Republicans, too, are offering lots of [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=246.88s)]
*  free stuff to people, including tax cuts, not quite explaining how they're going to [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=250.24s)]
*  pay for it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=254.44s)]
*  Democrats are still trying to find some way through that that will come with an explanation [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=255.68s)]
*  for how they're going to fund their programs, and that's just not very compelling right [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=259.76s)]
*  now. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=264.6s)]
*  Is it less compelling if everything falls apart and the numbers don't add up? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=265.6s)]
*  Possibly. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=269.12s)]
*  Democrats might have an opening once Republicans have a budget, which they punt and they punt [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=270.12s)]
*  week after week, but the situation right now is that Democrats are associated with free [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=273.36s)]
*  stuff for other people, and the Republicans are associated with benefits, tax breaks, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=278.8s)]
*  everything you want for you. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=282.96000000000004s)]
*  Well, again, I mean, the greatest irony of all is you've got all these Ivy League billionaires [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=284.24s)]
*  who actually Americans believe understand how they live more than Democrats, who have [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=289.32000000000005s)]
*  been successfully painted, and I will say over the past 30, 40 years have painted themselves [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=294.64000000000004s)]
*  into the corner of being elitists. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=300.12s)]
*  And so much of this just has to do with personality. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=303.12s)]
*  We always talk about a focus group we saw in 2016 where a blue working class blue collar [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=306.88s)]
*  woman asked, why are you supporting Donald Trump? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=314.48s)]
*  And she said, because he's one of us, because he's one of us. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=318.08s)]
*  I remember it was Tom Wicker that had a book on Nixon called One of Us, and Republicans [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=321.92s)]
*  have been very good, whether they are one of them or not, connecting there. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=329.2s)]
*  You take an example that you gave and the book Democrats don't have that right now, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=335.24s)]
*  not on the national stage. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=340.16s)]
*  Maybe Bernie, maybe AOC, but you look at the leadership, you look at Chuck Schumer and [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=341.44s)]
*  you brought up the conversation with Chuck Schumer when you're talking about his approval [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=347.40000000000003s)]
*  ratings versus Donald Trump's. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=352.12s)]
*  Tell us about it. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=353.76s)]
*  Yeah, Schumer was asked a pretty natural follow up question by Manu Raju of CNN. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=354.76s)]
*  You keep talking about Trump's polls, but our poll says you're 17 percent, and Schumer's [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=360.48s)]
*  answer was polls come and go. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=364.20000000000005s)]
*  But he is part of this conversation, too. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=365.84000000000003s)]
*  When you're talking about AOC, if she's not running for president, if she is running for [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=368.12s)]
*  something else, it would be Schumer's seat. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=371.24s)]
*  And a lot of AOC's popularity still comes from the fact that she was a young entrepreneurial [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=373.32000000000005s)]
*  candidate who challenged a party leader and won. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=377.96000000000004s)]
*  And there is not even a partisan valence to that. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=381.32000000000005s)]
*  The story of the left versus the center of the Democratic Party has almost been lost [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=384.6s)]
*  in the story of how AOC came up. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=388.6s)]
*  The same thing for Bernie Sanders. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=390.14000000000004s)]
*  Sanders is more popular than Chuck Schumer or most other people in the Democratic Party. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=391.44s)]
*  And it's not because voters are going through all of his policies and making sure they align [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=396.08s)]
*  with them. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=399.92s)]
*  It is this idea that they are not for the people who run the government all the time, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=400.92s)]
*  the permanent government. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=405.8s)]
*  A very powerful narrative that Trump is not really upsetting. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=406.8s)]
*  There are people who are making quite a lot of money by backing Trump. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=410.68s)]
*  But the idea out there remains that there is an ossified government that doesn't work [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=415.65999999999997s)]
*  very well. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=420.8s)]
*  Big donors own it. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=421.8s)]
*  And anyone who wants to smash that is OK with me. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=422.88s)]
*  And AOC passes some of that test for people rhetorically. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=425.52000000000004s)]
*  Sanders does. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=429.28000000000003s)]
*  Trump, to an extent, still does. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=430.28000000000003s)]
*  And Chuck Schumer does not. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=432.04s)]
*  And Chuck Schumer's appeals are towards stopping what Trump is doing and getting back to the [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=433.32s)]
*  government as we had it in January 19, 2025. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=437.08000000000004s)]
*  That's not as compelling. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=440.92s)]
*  And Democrats have found that is still not a compelling offer to people. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=442.12s)]
*  The Democrats who have been on the trail like J.B. Pritzker, they're not trail yet. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=445.3s)]
*  Democrats who might run for president, who have been more successful so far, are implying [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=448.76s)]
*  that the government will change if they get elected, too. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=454.68s)]
*  Democrat leadership is not. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=457.4s)]
*  It is very backward-looking. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=458.4s)]
*  Not very far backward-looking for months, but backward-looking. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=460.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, you know, and we talk about this all the time, Willie, Americans just aren't as [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=462.52s)]
*  ideological as people in Georgetown and Manhattan think they are. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=468.96s)]
*  You have, again, the same people that voted for Bernie Sanders in a primary in 2016, flipped [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=472.32s)]
*  over voted for Donald Trump. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=477.36s)]
*  We talk about it all the time, people who voted for Bobby Kennedy after he was assassinated. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=481.64s)]
*  A lot of them jumped over and started voting for George Wallace. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=486.15999999999997s)]
*  They want fighters. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=489.08s)]
*  They want people who believe they're on their side. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=490.15999999999997s)]
*  Right now, there are a lot of people who look at Bernie and AOC, and they're not sitting [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=492.71999999999997s)]
*  there saying what people in Manhattan and Georgetown are saying or on Fox News or MSNBC. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=496.64s)]
*  Oh, they're leftists. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=501.08s)]
*  They're just, no, it's like they'll fight for us. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=502.08s)]
*  They're going to shake up the system. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=505.88s)]
*  But it's usually not even about policy. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=507.28s)]
*  It's stylistic. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=508.96s)]
*  It's, are you fighting for us? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=509.96s)]
*  Because that's been part of the frustration in these first couple of months of the second [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=511.68s)]
*  Trump administration, Democrats who can't believe Donald Trump is back in the Oval Office [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=515.28s)]
*  saying, what are we going to do about it? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=519.88s)]
*  Who's going to stand up and push back on the public stage? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=521.24s)]
*  And AOC and Bernie Sanders have been doing it. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=524.8s)]
*  So there's one model right there. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=527.04s)]
*  There's also the efforts, the things that Hakeem Jeffries and Cory Booker are trying. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=528.64s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=534.0s)]
*  You can't criticize people for trying different ways to break through. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=535.0799999999999s)]
*  And we need more of that, not just Bernie and AOC, although that's a model. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=539.88s)]
*  I think the campaign starts today, and they should be looking every day for ways to break [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=543.7199999999999s)]
*  through, make news, and get their message across. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=548.7199999999999s)]
*  And sometimes it won't work, and sometimes it will. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=551.36s)]
*  That's the time we're in right now. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=556.16s)]
*  They've got to get out there, and it can't just be two people. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=557.36s)]
*  Yeah, you know, and Alex, I know we've got to go. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=559.64s)]
*  Just one final point, Rev. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=562.12s)]
*  And I know you know it, and I know I saw it when I campaigned. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=563.68s)]
*  This isn't all about where do they stand on Medicare Part B. Where do they stand? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=569.32s)]
*  I always knew within five seconds of walking into a room, whether I had the crowd or not. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=575.72s)]
*  That's right. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=581.04s)]
*  I always knew. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=582.04s)]
*  And there have been times where Mika and I walked into a room and she said, Joe, Doc, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=583.64s)]
*  right? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=589.28s)]
*  This is going to be a rough night. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=590.8s)]
*  You just survived. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=592.52s)]
*  She just looked around and surveilled the crowd. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=593.52s)]
*  But there are other times where I would walk in on a debate with an opponent, and I'd walk [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=595.4799999999999s)]
*  in, and five seconds later, I'd be like, oh, man, I can tell Red Sox stories or Alabama [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=600.16s)]
*  stories. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=606.0s)]
*  I got this. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=607.0s)]
*  And I know you know that, too. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=608.0s)]
*  And that's the thing about politicians. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=609.0s)]
*  They walk into a room. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=611.3199999999999s)]
*  Some people got it. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=612.64s)]
*  Some people don't. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=614.8199999999999s)]
*  And when you walk into that room, they aren't going, oh, he's wrong on this ideological [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=616.0s)]
*  issue. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=619.8s)]
*  It's like, look at him. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=620.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=621.8s)]
*  He's going to fight for us. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=622.8s)]
*  Or look at her. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=623.8s)]
*  She's pissed off. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=624.8s)]
*  She's going to fight for us. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=626.28s)]
*  I remember I told people that I had a lot of good mentors in civil rights, but the best [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=627.8399999999999s)]
*  advice I ever had came from James Brown. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=633.52s)]
*  The Godfather soul was like a dad to me. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=636.28s)]
*  He said, Reverend, people can feel you before they hear you. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=638.64s)]
*  And they know who you are and whether you connect with them. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=643.04s)]
*  Don't ever lose your feeling. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=647.28s)]
*  Because we were riding around in Georgia one night and he was playing all this jazz. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=648.8s)]
*  And I said, Mr. Brown, you play jazz? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=652.88s)]
*  He says, Reverend, I love jazz, but people like me to do get on the good foot. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=655.16s)]
*  You got to do what people understand and feel from you. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=660.64s)]
*  And that's what I think a lot of Democrats have been. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=663.9599999999999s)]
*  They're too smart to get a feeling of feeling people. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=666.16s)]
*  You can't be that smart. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=670.1199999999999s)]
*  Politics reporter for Semaphore, Dave Weigel. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdT4SmYcO0&t=671.88s)]
