# Where is Obama as Trump 'inflicts such damage'?, asks The Atlantic
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I)
*  We bring in Mark Lidovich. His latest piece asks this question. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=0.0s)]
*  Where is Barack Obama? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  And in it, Mark, you write, in part, quote, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=6.8s)]
*  No matter how brazen Trump becomes, the most effective communicator in the Democratic Party [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=9.5s)]
*  continues to opt for minimal communication. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=14.700000000000001s)]
*  His audacity of hope presidency has given way to the fierce lethargy of semi-retirement. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=18.2s)]
*  Obama's conspicuous scarcity while Trump inflicts such damage isn't just a bad look. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=24.8s)]
*  It's a dereliction of the message that he built his career on. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=30.8s)]
*  When Obama first ran for president in 2008, his former life as a community organizer was central to his message. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=34.800000000000004s)]
*  His campaign was not merely for him, but for civic action itself, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=42.6s)]
*  the idea of Americans being invested in their own change. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  After he left office in 2017, Obama said that he would work to inspire and develop the next cohort of leaders, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=52.0s)]
*  which is essentially the mission of his foundation. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=60.4s)]
*  It would seem a contradiction for him to say that he's devoting much of his post-presidency [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=63.6s)]
*  to promoting civic engagement when he himself seems so disengaged. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=69.0s)]
*  And Mark, strong piece, and I think it's one that's really touched a nerve here among many Democrats. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=74.6s)]
*  We've been used to for President Obama the last couple of campaigns. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=80.6s)]
*  He sort of fancies himself the closer, right? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=84.19999999999999s)]
*  He comes and gives a big convention speech, and then we see him on the road just the very end, sort of, you know, September, October. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=86.69999999999999s)]
*  He did a little more last time around for President Biden, but there's been Democrats for a while now saying we need more of him. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=92.89999999999999s)]
*  And especially now that Trump's in office, his absence, as you write, is really noticeable. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=99.6s)]
*  Yeah, I was really struck by the response to this piece, frankly. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=105.5s)]
*  I mean, I was a little nervous just because, you know, going after Barack Obama and challenging him on things is really going after a democratic, sacred cow. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=108.6s)]
*  You often hear some real pushback pretty quickly. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=116.5s)]
*  This one, very muted response as far as defense of him and very, very animated response in terms of, yeah, where has he been? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=120.0s)]
*  And I do think that his inaction and his disengagement here has been really conspicuous. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=128.7s)]
*  One, because there is actual demand for him. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=133.7s)]
*  I mean, it's not like, you know, George W. Bush is, you know, there's a great clamor, certainly in the Republican Party, for him. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=136.1s)]
*  But Democrats face such a leadership vacuum right now. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=142.1s)]
*  Barack Obama is actually a very gifted communicator still. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=146.0s)]
*  He's not too old. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=149.1s)]
*  You know, he could be much more active. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=151.0s)]
*  But he seems like he's really kind of done with this whole thing. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=152.9s)]
*  I mean, that seems to be his posture. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=155.6s)]
*  And I do think that this is even more conspicuous now given what Donald Trump is doing and given the lack of pushback across the board, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=157.6s)]
*  certainly from his own administration, certainly from his own party. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=165.0s)]
*  But also, since there is such a real weakness of democratic voices right now, I think, you know, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=168.0s)]
*  I think a lot of people would love for him to step in and say something much bolder than he's had now, which has been quite silent. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=174.4s)]
*  Mark, I wonder where you think he should be stepping in and what that should look like. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=180.7s)]
*  I mean, one interesting example we've seen is obviously Senator Bernie Sanders barnstorming with Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=186.4s)]
*  That's been really interesting because, of course, yes, there's a need for voices in the Democratic Party and influential figures, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=194.9s)]
*  but actually there's a need for new leadership as well. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=201.10000000000002s)]
*  So that's something that Senator Sanders has, I think, led the way on in a way, which is promising for them. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=204.10000000000002s)]
*  But I wonder what role you think former President Barack Obama should have, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=210.7s)]
*  especially given the concerns about just being a flashpoint in the politics of the Trump era. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=215.2s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's a good point. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=220.89999999999998s)]
*  I mean, that does seem to be the one defense of the Obama people, which is, you know, what's he going to do? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=222.29999999999998s)]
*  We don't want to crowd out the next generation of leaders. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=226.89999999999998s)]
*  The problem is there is no next generation of leaders. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=229.7s)]
*  I mean, Democrats have not gotten around to picking one really since Barack Obama himself was elected in 2008. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=232.89999999999998s)]
*  And I think the short answer on what should Barack Obama be doing now is frankly something more than he is. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=239.5s)]
*  I mean, I think a weekend like this where you have like literally tanks in the streets of Washington and in Los Angeles now, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=246.7s)]
*  and you will in a few days here, would be, I think, a really important time for someone who has presidential authority, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=253.3s)]
*  who's still relatively popular and who still has a lot of goodwill attached to him to actually remind in a very eloquent way Americans [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=259.7s)]
*  that this is not normal. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=267.7s)]
*  This is not generally how it's done. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=269.7s)]
*  It's not proper. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=271.8s)]
*  And it's frankly dangerous and actually in a very succinct way remind Americans that this is not the way it's supposed to be. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=272.59999999999997s)]
*  And it's certainly not something that he would ever have gotten away with if he had done this during his presidency. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=279.9s)]
*  The new piece. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=285.7s)]
*  Where is Barack Obama is online now for the Atlantic. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=286.8s)]
*  Subscribe folks. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkpLabrVv8I&t=290.7s)]
