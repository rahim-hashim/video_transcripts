**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc)

*  war on poverty. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=13.34s)]
*  Initially designed as a summer program to support low-income school children, Head Start [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=14.96s)]
*  has now reached over 40 million kids and their families, but advocates remain concerned about [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=19.82s)]
*  its future stability. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=25.46s)]
*  Since bringing NBC News political and national correspondent Jacob Soboroff. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=27.36s)]
*  Jacob, great to see you. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=30.6s)]
*  You visited a Head Start facility in North Carolina with a high-profile activist fighting [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=32.32s)]
*  to safeguard the future of that program. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=37.2s)]
*  Tell us more. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, sure did. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  Good morning, you guys. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  I went with Jennifer Garner. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  Jennifer Garner has long been an advocate for Save the Children. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  She has been an artist, ambassador, and board member for the organization since 2014, an [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=46.0s)]
*  organization dedicated to giving children a healthy start in life, giving them an opportunity [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=50.239999999999995s)]
*  to learn, and protecting them from harm. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  They sponsor nine different Head Start locations in six different states, and when she decided [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=57.16s)]
*  to check in on this one in Concord, North Carolina, she invited me to join her. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=61.44s)]
*  Screams, shrieks, and laughing. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=66.39999999999999s)]
*  All sounds of childish glee unlocked by the Head Start program in Concord, North Carolina. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=73.0s)]
*  Whoa, you brought it this morning. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=78.47999999999999s)]
*  A place of vibrant color, kindness, and smiles. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=80.8s)]
*  The Kerr Street Center is a lifeline to more than 108 children and families. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=84.88s)]
*  They bloom and they create their own imagination. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=90.0s)]
*  Providing invaluable and free early childhood education and development to those struggling [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=94.03999999999999s)]
*  to make ends meet. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=98.75999999999999s)]
*  I think all the best things in the world are... [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=100.36s)]
*  Wormwood! [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=103.19999999999999s)]
*  Wormwood! [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=104.19999999999999s)]
*  Jennifer Garner has been a part of Save the Children for 15 years. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=105.19999999999999s)]
*  Every little kid comes with their own talents and strengths, right? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=108.72s)]
*  And I tell you what, the heart of the teachers and the heart of people who work with kids, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=112.32s)]
*  that is like... [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=118.88s)]
*  This past school year, Save the Children Head Start programming supported more than 2,250 [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=120.91999999999999s)]
*  children and their families across six states. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=126.24s)]
*  Nationwide, Head Start supports nearly 800,000 yearly. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=128.68s)]
*  So when an early draft of the president's budget threatened to defund the program, supporters, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=133.0s)]
*  including Jennifer Garner, leapt into action. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=137.88s)]
*  She caught up with her last week as she lobbied Congress to save Head Start. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=140.84s)]
*  What's the message for the lawmakers? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=144.88000000000002s)]
*  The message is, hey, let's talk about poor kids. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=146.52s)]
*  Head Start is so, so important. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=149.52s)]
*  It impacts... [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=151.16000000000003s)]
*  We have about a million kids, a little less than a million kids in this country enrolled [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=152.16000000000003s)]
*  in Head Start. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=155.52s)]
*  And if it's on the chopping block, that's a lot of kids. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=157.52s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=159.76000000000002s)]
*  Thanks for showing us the way. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=160.76000000000002s)]
*  I grew up in poverty. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=162.52s)]
*  I was also a child who attended a Head Start program. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=164.32000000000002s)]
*  Dr. Olivia Givens is program director for Save the Children Head Start in North Carolina. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=169.2s)]
*  She's determined to ensure that a child's zip code won't determine their destiny. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=175.44s)]
*  We provide educational services for our children, social-emotional support. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=179.84s)]
*  We provide support to our parents. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=185.52s)]
*  They also provide meals for children who otherwise might not have regular access to food. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=187.84s)]
*  One possible alternative to what these kids are experiencing today is sitting at home [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=193.32s)]
*  and going hungry. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=196.92000000000002s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  90% of the children and kids in the United States are growing up food insecure. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=199.83999999999997s)]
*  Of those, 90% of those kids are growing up in rural America. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=202.55999999999997s)]
*  Kids in rural America are struggling. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=207.83999999999997s)]
*  For Malik and Jasmine Van Diver, Head Start hasn't just been good for the growth of their [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=209.92s)]
*  sons. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=213.39999999999998s)]
*  What does this place mean to you guys? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=214.39999999999998s)]
*  You have two kids here. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=216.04s)]
*  How important is it to your family? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=218.16s)]
*  It's paramount to everything, to be honest with you. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=219.48s)]
*  This place has not only helped your children develop, but made you better parents and people? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=222.64s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=227.2s)]
*  For Dasha Drake, her husband Steven, and their three kids, Head Start is about more than [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=228.48s)]
*  just childcare. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=232.28s)]
*  Because you're also a teacher here, if Head Start were to go away, the ramifications would [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=233.28s)]
*  be far beyond your children. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=237.11999999999998s)]
*  I wouldn't have a job, so that affects us financially. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=238.76s)]
*  My children wouldn't be at the center, so the three meals a day here put us in a bind, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=243.04s)]
*  for sure. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=248.83999999999997s)]
*  Thanks for learning. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=249.83999999999997s)]
*  We think of childcare as like graham crackers and a nap and a wipe the nose. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=250.83999999999997s)]
*  That is not what we're talking about. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=256.64000000000004s)]
*  These teachers, these professionals, these educators, they are brain architects. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=258.36s)]
*  They are training these brains to become learners. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=263.08000000000004s)]
*  It feels like they're a part of a larger family. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=266.12s)]
*  It doesn't feel like a school. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=269.12s)]
*  It feels like a place where these kids are loved. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=270.12s)]
*  Just there's nothing more optimistic than reaching a kid when they're young and helping [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=273.92s)]
*  them out. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=279.24s)]
*  However, that looks for you. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=280.24s)]
*  I am a leader with a smile. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=281.52000000000004s)]
*  Jen Garner doesn't stop. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=287.32000000000005s)]
*  And by the way, after an early draft budget from the Trump administration called for the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=288.52000000000004s)]
*  elimination of Head Start funding, they now say the updated budget keeps Head Start in [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=292.40000000000003s)]
*  place, but advocates like Garner are continuing to highlight the program's critical work on [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=297.40000000000003s)]
*  behalf of all of the vulnerable kids all across the nation. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=301.32000000000005s)]
*  You can go online and learn more about these organizations. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=305.28000000000003s)]
*  I will say, one of the things that came up in the town hall that we did last Thursday [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=308.12s)]
*  with workers in the education department, HHS, all of which intersects. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=311.0s)]
*  That was great. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=315.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=316.4s)]
*  With Head Start, they say one thing and then they walk it back and then they may very well [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=317.4s)]
*  yet cut it again. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=322.48s)]
*  So there's still a lot of worry out there about the future of this program. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=323.96s)]
*  NBC News correspondent Jacob Soboroff, thank you. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=327.24s)]
*  It's always good to see you. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFM52rtbKc&t=330.0s)]
