# National security reporter recaps Pentagon press briefing
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ)
*  Right to NBC News, senior national security correspondent Courtney Kubi, who was in the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=0.0s)]
*  brief room, you can see, still in the brief room there at the Pentagon for the news conference. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=4.24s)]
*  Courtney, what are some of your biggest takeaways? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=8.72s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we got a lot more fidelity on the strikes at Fordo, one of the facilities. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=10.28s)]
*  Unfortunately, we didn't really hear anything about the other two facilities, but we got [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=15.64s)]
*  a little bit more fidelity. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=19.0s)]
*  A couple of things that really stood out to me about that mission itself, which we've [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=20.0s)]
*  gotten more and more detail on as the days have unfolded. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=23.8s)]
*  Number one, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Dan Cain, he laid it out exactly [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=27.1s)]
*  how the U.S. was able to see that the ventilation vents that the U.S. was—that struck, the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=31.3s)]
*  U.S. military struck as part of, like, a more vulnerable part of the facility, that they [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=37.86s)]
*  were actually covered in concrete not too long before the military mission. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=43.18000000000001s)]
*  They blew those off, and then they launched the additional five more MOPs, these massive [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=47.82s)]
*  into the ventilation shafts to target the underground facility. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=53.84s)]
*  Now, one thing that stood out to me is, you know, General Cain continued to say that the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=57.440000000000005s)]
*  actual battle damage assessment is not done by the U.S. military. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=62.56s)]
*  In fact, that is something that's compiled by the intelligence community. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=66.2s)]
*  He even said, we don't do our—we don't grade our own homework here. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=69.32000000000001s)]
*  And so he didn't go so far as to say that this has been destroyed, obliterated, whatever [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=72.68s)]
*  it is. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=78.80000000000001s)]
*  But other than that, he showed a test video, a recent test video, that showed the capability [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=79.8s)]
*  of the weapon, and he showed exactly how they were able to target the facility. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=85.88s)]
*  He said that they hit the intended aim points, and they are confident that the bombs exploded. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=90.12s)]
*  But not going any further than that, expressing, again, confidence in the mission, praise, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=95.56s)]
*  extended praise for the men and women, men and women, who were involved in this. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=100.6s)]
*  In fact, he made a point of saying, in fact, that there was even women aviators as part [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=106.0s)]
*  of this mission, including it sounded as if on the B-2s as well. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=110.0s)]
*  But beyond that, we didn't get a whole lot of specifics about exactly how they know. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=114.52s)]
*  For instance, one big question that remains, President Trump yesterday at the summit, or [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=119.82s)]
*  the press conference at The Hague, saying that there were people who were on the ground [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=124.48s)]
*  that got eyes on the facility. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=128.18s)]
*  That's one of the reasons they have confidence here. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=129.84s)]
*  We still don't really know exactly who those individuals were. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=131.32s)]
*  And one of the big questions, you know, the chairman again saying that they believe this [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=135.76s)]
*  mission overall, hitting their aim points, was successful in that way. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=140.01999999999998s)]
*  But we still don't really know a whole lot more about Natanz and about Isfahan, the other [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=143.76s)]
*  two sites that were hit, one by additional massive ordnance penetrators, the other by [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=148.14s)]
*  tomahawks from the submarines. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=152.95999999999998s)]
*  And notably, one of the reporters in here asked the secretary if he would vow to provide [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=155.24s)]
*  more information, and he did not do so, Jonathan. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=161.08s)]
*  Yeah, and Courtney, you're right to mention what the president said yesterday about having [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=164.04000000000002s)]
*  assets on the ground, raising some speculation perhaps Israeli intelligence or something. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=168.0s)]
*  He said something that perhaps he shouldn't have there. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=172.52s)]
*  Is there any sense here, and I know they ducked and dodged a little bit, of a better timeline [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=176.24s)]
*  as to, or military officials beyond those that we just heard from at the podium telling [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=181.28s)]
*  you when we think we will have a better sense as to actually what transpired over the weekend? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=184.78s)]
*  No, we're not getting that at all. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=190.88000000000002s)]
*  And every time he was asked about it, the chairman kept saying, look, this is an intelligence [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=193.48000000000002s)]
*  community product, and we are the recipient of the information once they have it complete. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=196.8s)]
*  Keep in mind, from the very beginning, General Cain, the chairman of the Joint Chief, Sunday [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=203.4s)]
*  morning stood here and said, it can take time. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=207.36s)]
*  It can be days or even weeks before they have a full picture here. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=211.4s)]
*  So this preliminary report that was created, compiled by the Defense Intelligence Agency, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=214.32000000000002s)]
*  has repeatedly been described as such, as a preliminary look, an early look at what [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=220.44s)]
*  they knew about what happened primarily at Fordale. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=227.0s)]
*  So all along, there's been an acknowledgement that this information could continue to evolve [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=230.35999999999999s)]
*  as more intelligence came in. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=235.4s)]
*  Again, we didn't get a whole lot of additional detail about additional intelligence that [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=237.24s)]
*  they've gathered since the strikes. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=243.56s)]
*  Instead, we got a pretty comprehensive lesson on how the penetrator works, this massive [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=246.56s)]
*  bomb works. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=253.32s)]
*  But as far as the actual details about what it did, it seems to be more of an assumption [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=255.28s)]
*  based off the fact that the bombs went in at the correct angle. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=260.0s)]
*  They struck the exact aim points they were intended to based off what appears to be years [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=263.76s)]
*  of gathering evidence and intelligence on the facility itself. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=267.8s)]
*  They believe that based off of those factors, this would have been successful, but they [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=272.20000000000005s)]
*  didn't provide the actual evidence of whether they've gathered information. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=276.88000000000005s)]
*  For instance, eyes on, people actually seeing the facility itself underground, seeing that [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=282.44s)]
*  it was destroyed. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=287.12s)]
*  There was one other notable thing that the chairman said. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=288.12s)]
*  He said that he believes that the bombs destroyed critical hardware. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=290.52000000000004s)]
*  So another notable mention from the chairman. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=297.12s)]
*  Courtney, I just wanted to thank you so much for all your reporting. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=301.84s)]
*  I just wanted to ask you about other possible sites in terms of that might where centrifuges [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=304.96s)]
*  might be held. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=310.6s)]
*  And then if you could talk briefly about the Defense Intelligence Agency, just sort of [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=312.6s)]
*  who runs it, whether it's military officials or political appointees. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=316.12s)]
*  Yeah, and that was another thing that several reporters pressed the press the secretary [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=319.92s)]
*  on is this idea that maybe some of the highly enriched uranium may have been moved out of [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=324.44s)]
*  Fordow, moved to other locations in advance of the strike. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=329.68s)]
*  He was dismissive of that and said he hadn't seen any intelligence to prove that. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=332.72s)]
*  But of course, we've seen that there are satellite imagery in the photos that appear to show [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=336.12s)]
*  trucks taking things out of Fordow several days before the U.S. military strike. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=340.6s)]
*  So that was another thing that we didn't get a specific answer to. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=345.08s)]
*  And just for our viewers, the highly enriched uranium, why that's such a big deal here is [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=348.28000000000003s)]
*  that is what creates is the fissile material that can create a nuclear weapon. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=353.64s)]
*  You need the highly enriched uranium. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=358.84s)]
*  It's almost like the fuse for any kind of a nuclear weapon. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=363.2s)]
*  It's a critical part of that. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=366.4s)]
*  As far as the Defense Intelligence Agency, it is one of the it is an arm of the Pentagon. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=368.03999999999996s)]
*  It's run by a three star general. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=372.94s)]
*  It's not a political agency. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=374.53999999999996s)]
*  They are intended to, in some cases, aggregate or gather information from other places and [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=376.48s)]
*  provide an analysis. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=381.56s)]
*  That was one thing that we actually heard from the secretary today. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=382.56s)]
*  He said that this initial report out of DIA was essentially a post strike report and that [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=385.04s)]
*  it can provide intelligence about whether the U.S. military has to do follow on strikes, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=391.52000000000004s)]
*  whether in fact they were able to destroy something to the extent that it is completely [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=397.16s)]
*  finished off or it might need follow on military action here. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=401.04s)]
*  That was something that we hadn't heard about that to this point yet, David. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KqSuctZNQ&t=404.82000000000005s)]
