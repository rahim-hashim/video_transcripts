# 'Existential threat': Why Senator sees shrinking middle class as greatest national security issue
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4)
*  I, officer and Pentagon official by training, I believe that the single greatest security [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=0.0s)]
*  threat to the United States is not coming from abroad. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=6.22s)]
*  It's the shrinking middle class here at home, in the middle class in the first place. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=10.1s)]
*  And this is the thing that many Democrats have, quite frankly, lost touch with. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=15.02s)]
*  When you can't provide for your kids, you feel anger, you feel shame, you lose your [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=19.94s)]
*  dignity and you look for something or someone to blame. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=25.74s)]
*  That anger, that suspicion among Americans, that right there is what I mean by an existential threat. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=31.419999999999998s)]
*  Democrats are very disparate. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=39.3s)]
*  We're like a solar system with no sun. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=42.78s)]
*  Like, we got a lot of planets, some with their own gravitational pull, we got a lot of stars. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=45.14s)]
*  But there's like not enough co-hearing us. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=51.379999999999995s)]
*  We don't act as a team. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=54.54s)]
*  And when we do that, and when we don't work as a team, we turn our guns on each other. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=58.26s)]
*  And it's so, so, so fruitless. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=63.62s)]
*  That was Democratic Senator Alyssa Slotkin of Michigan yesterday, delivering a wake-up [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=67.18s)]
*  call to Democrats while pushing her party to focus on the middle class. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=71.42s)]
*  And Senator Slotkin, we're happy to say, joins us now. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=76.38s)]
*  She's also a member of the Armed Services Committee. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=78.7s)]
*  Good morning, Senator. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=81.02s)]
*  Thanks for being here. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=82.46000000000001s)]
*  Let's start a little more with your speech there and this focus on the middle class and [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=84.58s)]
*  the idea of affordability. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=89.5s)]
*  It's something that polls suggest the Republicans, even with a billionaire atop the ticket, they [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=91.66s)]
*  won that argument during last year's elections. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=96.98s)]
*  Not everywhere, but they won it nationally and they certainly won with the White House. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=99.54s)]
*  What do Democrats need to change? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=102.78s)]
*  I mean, I think it's about prioritizing the economy and costs, frankly, at this point, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=104.86s)]
*  almost above anything else, and making sure we're actually responding to the needs of [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=112.06s)]
*  the people. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=115.98s)]
*  The November election made this very clear, even though I don't think this president [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=116.98s)]
*  is at all lowering people's costs. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=120.10000000000001s)]
*  I think he's raising costs in a whole bunch of areas. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=121.94s)]
*  Democrats, if you stand for everything, then no one knows what your priorities are. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=124.94s)]
*  We have to get back to our basics, do the foundational things, job creation, housing. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=128.74s)]
*  We should declare a housing emergency right now based on the problem. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=133.18s)]
*  Health care. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=137.62s)]
*  Is there anyone in America who thinks that health care is working right? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=138.62s)]
*  So get back to the basics. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=141.46s)]
*  Focus on those things ruthlessly. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=143.62s)]
*  So Senator, you obviously more of a moderate Democrat, but what you just mentioned there, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=146.46s)]
*  cost of living, cost of housing also were the centerpieces of the campaign in New York [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=151.66s)]
*  City for the Democratic nominee for mayor, Zoran Mondani. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=157.34s)]
*  He of course proudly declares himself a socialist, very, very far to the left on to you and many [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=160.98000000000002s)]
*  of your colleagues on many issues. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=166.94s)]
*  But yet in some ways you're speaking the same language. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=168.46s)]
*  So my question is, what do you make of his rise? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=170.3s)]
*  Is the party big enough for all of you? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=172.94s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think I'm not going to pretend to be a complete expert on New York City politics, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=176.02s)]
*  but I think the messages coming out of that election a couple of days ago seem clear to [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=182.18s)]
*  me, which were number one, people just like in November are still really focused on the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=185.66000000000003s)]
*  cost of living, on economy and their own kitchen table economics. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=190.46s)]
*  And number two, people are looking for a new generation of leadership. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=195.02s)]
*  I think you're seeing that across the board. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=198.18s)]
*  I think that's a hangover from the last presidential election. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=199.57999999999998s)]
*  People want something different. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=203.26s)]
*  We don't agree on everything, that's for sure. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=205.34s)]
*  But I think those were the major messages. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=207.85999999999999s)]
*  And so the economy and getting back to those basics is an area where a lot of Democrats [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=209.44s)]
*  agree it is an area where we can unite. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=214.42s)]
*  And I think that's where we need to get back to. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=217.7s)]
*  And it just kind of no one cares about your trick plays if you don't get your basics right. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=219.94s)]
*  Senator, I want to talk to you about another issue that has wide resonance with Americans [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=224.5s)]
*  as the father of a five year old resonates with me. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=228.73999999999998s)]
*  I'll read you your quote. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=231.17999999999998s)]
*  We should ban cell phones in every K to 12 classroom in America. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=232.78s)]
*  Congress and the courts should hold social media companies accountable for using [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=236.33999999999997s)]
*  algorithms that get kids addicted to extreme content on their platforms. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=240.94s)]
*  This is something that I've wondered about. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=244.5s)]
*  Is the Jonathan Haidt anxious generation movement a politically viable one? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=247.82s)]
*  Could you please explain why you decided to take up that cause in particular? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=253.01999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think I just started to do actually a deep dive on how we should be thinking [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=256.86s)]
*  about education with artificial intelligence coming coming in. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=262.54s)]
*  Right. I mean, people don't get that artificial intelligence has the potential to change our [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=265.66s)]
*  economy and our schools more than the Internet did. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=269.78000000000003s)]
*  So really significant. And as I went on that deep dive, you know, all the studies that [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=272.5s)]
*  have now been done about distraction, lack of concentration, lack of people skills that [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=276.98s)]
*  our kids have, lack of critical thinking. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=281.94s)]
*  It just really, you know, kind of pulled me in that while we're thinking about A.I., [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=284.42s)]
*  what we're really not grappling with is what cell phones and social media in general are [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=289.14s)]
*  already doing in our classrooms. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=293.3s)]
*  Kids can have those things outside of the classrooms. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=295.18s)]
*  But I just felt very strongly that the evidence was there. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=297.34s)]
*  You want your kids to learn in that classroom. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=300.14s)]
*  Don't allow them to have their phone. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=302.1s)]
*  It's amazing how much that movement is catching on right around the country, including in [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=304.14s)]
*  red states, by the way, that are also trying to ban cell phones in classrooms. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=307.14s)]
*  Can I turn now to international affairs? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=311.02000000000004s)]
*  Senator, a week ago, you had some very tough comments to the defense about the defense [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=313.3s)]
*  secretary around Iran. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=317.34000000000003s)]
*  I don't know if you saw the press conference that he gave yesterday where he was berating [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=320.06s)]
*  the media. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=325.18s)]
*  I'm just wondering what you made of that press conference and what questions you still have [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=326.18s)]
*  of the administration. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=330.1s)]
*  As a former intelligence analyst at CIA yourself, you try to make the best assessment of how [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=331.78000000000003s)]
*  far we managed to destroy Iran's nuclear program. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=337.18s)]
*  Yeah, so I'm a former CIA officer and Pentagon official. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=341.26s)]
*  So we finally got our briefing from Secretary Hegseth, Secretary Rubio, the director of [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=345.1s)]
*  the CIA, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs yesterday. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=349.78000000000003s)]
*  All senators got that brief. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=352.48s)]
*  It was very well attended. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=353.58000000000004s)]
*  It was classified, so I can't go into the details. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=354.58000000000004s)]
*  But I think what was important to me is that there's been significant damage done to the [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=357.42s)]
*  Iranian program, and I think that's a positive thing. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=362.74s)]
*  The battle damage assessment, the true understanding of whether something was destroyed and how [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=367.34000000000003s)]
*  many years we set a program back, that's going to take a minute. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=371.82000000000005s)]
*  And anyone who says that, oh, this is exactly what happened, either the president of the [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=374.96000000000004s)]
*  United States or someone who's a critic of the president of the United States, if you [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=379.14000000000004s)]
*  say you know what happened already, you just you don't understand how intelligence works, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=382.26000000000005s)]
*  it takes a minute. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=385.94000000000005s)]
*  And we're going to see. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=387.66s)]
*  We're going to have to figure that out. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=388.66s)]
*  I think in the meantime, though, there's damage to their nuclear program. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=390.66s)]
*  There's also damage to the psychology of the regime, right, of the government. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=393.58s)]
*  They have no air defenses on top of Iran right now. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=397.7s)]
*  I mean, it is vulnerable, more vulnerable than it's been in my entire lifetime. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=401.09999999999997s)]
*  That changes a country. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=405.26s)]
*  So I think we need to wait. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=406.41999999999996s)]
*  I was glad they finally did a briefing. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=408.65999999999997s)]
*  It was very obvious that the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, was not there, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=411.02s)]
*  which is unusual. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=414.94s)]
*  But, you know, I'm just going to withhold judgment a little bit when it's something [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=415.94s)]
*  as important as intelligence and military battle damage. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=421.34s)]
*  OK, Democratic Senator Alyssa Slotkin of Michigan, thank you so much for joining us [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=424.14s)]
*  this morning, Senator. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=428.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inLwEchPha4&t=429.02s)]
