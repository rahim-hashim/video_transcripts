# Medicaid cuts could require some patients to travel 80 miles for care: Rural Hospital CEO
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY)
*  And joining us now, chief executive officer at the Lincoln Community Hospital and Care [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=0.0s)]
*  Center in rural Colorado, Kevin Stansberry. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  Kevin is the author of a recent guest essay for The New York Times entitled, What Medicaid [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=9.6s)]
*  Cuts Would Do to My Rural Hospital. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=15.32s)]
*  In it, Kevin writes in part this, the proud conservative residents of our community often [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=18.92s)]
*  feel left out of Colorado's more liberal politics. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  Our voices never seem to be as loud as those in metro areas of the state. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=27.76s)]
*  And yet, with the looming threat of Medicaid cuts at the federal level and budget proposals [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  that would cut rural health care, we're wondering if our voices are heard at all in this Republican [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=38.74s)]
*  administration and Congress. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=45.64s)]
*  The nation's food and fuel are sourced in rural areas. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=48.6s)]
*  Supporting rural communities should be strategically important, and they can't thrive without health [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=53.72s)]
*  care. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=59.3s)]
*  I know the financial peril my hospital will face if our Medicaid lifeline is severed. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=60.3s)]
*  But the real damage, the kind that keeps me up at night, will be done to the hardworking [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=66.52s)]
*  people in my rural community. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=71.8s)]
*  And Kevin, thank you so much for coming on. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=75.88s)]
*  Could you tell us more about what you think is at stake for the people that your hospital [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=78.75999999999999s)]
*  serves? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=83.78s)]
*  Good morning, Mika, and thank you for that summary of the article. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=84.78s)]
*  I think it's first important to understand the nature of rural hospitals. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=90.26s)]
*  Many rural hospitals in Colorado and across the country are independent community hospitals. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=95.18s)]
*  We're not affiliated with systems. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=100.30000000000001s)]
*  We have boards that are appointed from the community, and we're really trying to take [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=102.52000000000001s)]
*  care of our community members. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=106.18s)]
*  We're also very geographic dispersed. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=108.98s)]
*  So in my hospital, we serve an area roughly the size of the state of Connecticut, but [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=111.86s)]
*  there's only about two people per square mile in there. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=118.02s)]
*  So what that creates is this dynamic where the hospital ends up, because of its community [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=121.44s)]
*  focus, we end up offering a lot of services that may not be financially lucrative, but [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=126.18s)]
*  are necessary to support the members of our community. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=131.34s)]
*  So services like long-term care, services like home health, ambulance services, many [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=135.18s)]
*  of those services are not necessarily financially sustainable on their own, but we offer them [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=142.22s)]
*  anyway because they're important to our community members. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=147.14000000000001s)]
*  Without the Medicaid funding for those services, that's going to put rural hospitals in an [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=150.58s)]
*  even deeper hole, a hole that has been growing since the end of the pandemic. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=156.66s)]
*  So we have to figure out a way how to continue to offer those services in rural communities, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=162.14s)]
*  and at the same time, take a look at what's the best way to manage these Medicaid costs [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=167.98s)]
*  that Congress is trying to look at right now. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=173.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=178.14s)]
*  I mean, if they weren't able to access the care that they need at your hospital, where [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=179.14s)]
*  would residents in your community go for health care? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=185.1s)]
*  So the next nearest hospital to us is roughly 85 miles away. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=191.34s)]
*  In either Denver or Colorado Springs, they're about equidistant from us. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=195.5s)]
*  And so what that creates is patients don't often go into the city because they're busy [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=199.46s)]
*  working at their jobs, either on the farm or the ranch. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=204.66s)]
*  So if we don't offer care locally, often that care goes away. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=208.18s)]
*  Some of the most important care that we offer is services like primary care and chronic [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=212.7s)]
*  disease management. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=217.1s)]
*  And I would suggest that there's an investment in paying for those services because we can [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=219.06s)]
*  provide care at a relatively low cost to manage those chronic diseases instead of letting [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=224.34s)]
*  them become more acute when they really have to then present to the emergency department [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=230.66s)]
*  at a much higher cost of care. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=234.98s)]
*  Kevin, Simone Sanders Townsend here. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=237.62s)]
*  You know, last night on our show, we talked to a Republican congresswoman from Indiana [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=240.42000000000002s)]
*  who said, look, they really want to make the benefits better for people and to crack down [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=246.58s)]
*  on the companies and the hospitals and take advantage of folks. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=252.78s)]
*  But I just want to just cut through the mess for a little bit. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=257.02s)]
*  What would it mean if Congress ended up putting a cap on the amount that the federal government [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=260.22s)]
*  sends to the states for Medicaid patients? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=269.06s)]
*  Would your state be able to make that up so that folks don't lose care? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=273.9s)]
*  Can you guarantee that? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=278.02s)]
*  No, I don't think anybody can guarantee that. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=280.02s)]
*  And I think all of the states, especially Colorado, what I know most about, the state [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=283.21999999999997s)]
*  would be hard pressed to make up the difference from the federal government right now. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=289.02s)]
*  Promises were made, programs were developed based on those promises. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=293.41999999999996s)]
*  In Colorado and in my hospital, those funds that we get from Medicaid keep our doors open. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=299.02s)]
*  About 25% of my revenue is from Medicaid. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=306.42s)]
*  If that's materially impacted, I can't offer the services that we continue to offer. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=309.52s)]
*  So again, as Mika pointed out earlier, either those services simply aren't available to [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=315.46s)]
*  those patients or patients have to travel an hour and a half to get to the next closest [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=320.34s)]
*  care site. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=325.38s)]
*  And I want to give an illustration. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=326.7s)]
*  So for example, we just started a very small infusion therapy program to provide chemotherapy [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=328.12s)]
*  for patients with cancer. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=334.08s)]
*  If any of you have had a loved one with cancer, or hopefully not, that you've experienced [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=336.04s)]
*  that, people tell me one of the worst times of that is the travel back home after the [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=342.08s)]
*  chemotherapy treatment. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=347.68s)]
*  Can you imagine having to drive an hour and a half after you've gotten chemotherapy just [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=349.84000000000003s)]
*  to go home? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=355.28000000000003s)]
*  And again, patients sometimes choose not to seek that treatment then. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=356.88s)]
*  And I think it's important for us all to realize that it shouldn't matter where you live, if [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=361.6s)]
*  you live. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=368.32s)]
*  And so we just are trying to offer those same basic services that are essentially funded [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=369.32s)]
*  by Medicaid to keep that care coming to the patients in our community. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=374.24s)]
*  Chief Executive Officer at Lincoln Community Hospital and Care Center in Hugo, Colorado, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=380.28s)]
*  Kevin Stansbury. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=386.28s)]
*  Thank you very much for making your case here on Morning Joe today. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=387.84s)]
*  It's good to have you on. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mp3P3AvOgY&t=392.4s)]
