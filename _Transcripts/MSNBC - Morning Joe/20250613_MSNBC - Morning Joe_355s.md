# 'Hegseth is way out of his depth': House member slams defense secretary after hearings
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ)
*  Congressman Jim Himes of Connecticut. He's the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee. Congressman, thank you for being with us this morning on a very busy [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Newsday. Let's start with [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=8.32s)]
*  What we're seeing in the Middle East [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=10.72s)]
*  strikes last night continuing today and coming after [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=12.8s)]
*  Days really weeks of President Trump saying to Israel. This isn't what I want [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  Let's try to settle this at the negotiating table, but Prime Minister Netanyahu went ahead [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=21.84s)]
*  Yeah, and not at all surprising to me, right? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=26.68s)]
*  And I mean it's important to put this in context like decades worth of context [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=28.8s)]
*  You know Iran has been a massive destabilizing force for a very long time and we all agree that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=32.34s)]
*  Israel is our ally we will stand by Israel [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=38.760000000000005s)]
*  But there are some undercurrents here [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=41.6s)]
*  That we can't ignore [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  You know just to give you a couple number one. I think it's sort of unanimous that war is the last resort [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=46.32s)]
*  For reasons practical and ethical and in this instance war is not the last resort [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=52.72s)]
*  In fact war was undertaken at a time when President Trump and his people were trying to reach a diplomatic agreement [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=57.919999999999995s)]
*  Of course, there's a context to that too, right? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=63.959999999999994s)]
*  Because in 2018 the president tore up a diplomatic agreement that had done a pretty good job of keeping Iran in a box [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=66.0s)]
*  Secondly, look the Prime Minister is making a bet here and I think based on my contact with him this extends well beyond [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=72.19999999999999s)]
*  Taking out nuclear infrastructure and trying to affect and maybe hoping for a regime change [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=79.32s)]
*  Here's the other underlying factor [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=84.88s)]
*  Anyone who's watched the Middle East since World War two knows that you can go into the Middle East with the best of hopes and [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=86.76s)]
*  Expectations only to have it crash around your ears [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=91.72s)]
*  So there is a huge and I think the stock market that you just pointed out reflects this there is a huge range of [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=94.8s)]
*  Possibilities here a lot of them very very ugly and not just for the region [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=100.24s)]
*  But for gasoline prices at the pump for the possibility that American troops get sucked in so anyway, this is a moment of real [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=104.62s)]
*  Nervousness for a lot of people I think and certainly a lot of Iran's proxies have really been damaged since October 7th and the fallout [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=112.06s)]
*  So that might have been part of the factors here that convinced Israel now is the time to do this [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=119.02000000000001s)]
*  I mean, what what do you hope comes next here? Did a return to the negotiating table like if you know [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=123.98s)]
*  What are you you said it there larger concerns here? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=131.46s)]
*  I mean American troops on the ground is something that President Trump. Of course has said he will not do [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=134.74s)]
*  Sometimes events get away from you. Yeah. Look in my opinion this notion that there will be a return to the negotiating table is insane [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=139.26s)]
*  I mean the Iranians are in the inheritors of a [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=145.0s)]
*  2,000 year very proud history going back to the Persians, you know [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=147.7s)]
*  We're fighting with the Athenians the Iranians in my opinion are not going to the negotiating table [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=151.42s)]
*  They cannot the regime cannot be perceived as having been forced to the negotiating table. So they're in this and [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=157.28s)]
*  We need to pray that the outperformance the surprising outperformance of the Israelis both against his Bala and against Hamas [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=163.84s)]
*  Continues you look we all know what the best outcome here is [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=171.76000000000002s)]
*  the best outcome is that the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=174.32000000000002s)]
*  You know in nuclear infrastructure has taken out that the regime falls and somehow the Iranian people put in place a democratic regime [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=176.20000000000002s)]
*  But again, you can't name for me an example in the last 50 years where you know military [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=181.98000000000002s)]
*  Activity in the Middle East has ended well and predictably congressman John Howman has the next question [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=186.78s)]
*  Hey congressman, we've been focused a lot on on what's going on in Los Angeles over the course of this week [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=193.98s)]
*  but back in Washington [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=199.29999999999998s)]
*  the Secretary of Defense has been on Capitol Hill and [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=201.62s)]
*  Kind of refusing in a number of cases refusing to answer questions that seem [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=205.1s)]
*  pretty straightforward and pretty legitimate like talking about what the plans are and the budgets going to be for this retro [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=209.1s)]
*  retrofitting of the Qatari the new Qatari Air Force one [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=215.32s)]
*  Yesterday he refused to answer a question from one of your colleagues Rokana about whether he would abide by federal court rules [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=219.48s)]
*  Federal court rulings that were laid down [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=226.48s)]
*  I'm curious about what you think of is how you evaluate on [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=228.95999999999998s)]
*  On the whole here also his willingness immediately to dispatch those 700 Marines [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=232.88s)]
*  To LA. I'm curious what you think of how Secretary Hegsteth is doing at this point [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=238.12s)]
*  And whether we're starting to see some of the things that people worried about with his confirmation [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=243.44s)]
*  Well, of course we are right. I mean look we could have a partisan bickering match about this [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=248.92000000000002s)]
*  But serious people know that Pete Hegsteth is way way out of his depth, right? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=254.16s)]
*  We saw this with a signal chat [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=258.88s)]
*  We saw it we see it over and over and over again [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=260.24s)]
*  And at the time that of the signal chat scandal for example when he was posting [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=262.88s)]
*  You know in advance of strikes precisely the weapon systems being used to undertake strikes against the Houthi what I thought to myself [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=268.2s)]
*  Well, let's just hope that we don't have an international conflict that actually requires Pete Hegsteth to provide advice to provide wisdom to provide [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=274.15999999999997s)]
*  Judgment and here we are with a war ongoing in the Middle East [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=282.59999999999997s)]
*  So his behavior is perfectly predictable, right? If you work for Donald Trump, you are not a cabinet secretary [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=285.56s)]
*  You are an acolyte and you do exactly what Donald Trump wants you to do and Donald Trump wants that Qatari jet [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=290.32s)]
*  He wants the option to deploy the Marines throughout the United States if you read that order that he issued he can deploy military force [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=296.08s)]
*  Not just in Los Angeles and it is not gonna be Pete Hegsteth who says yeah [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=302.32s)]
*  I'm not quite sure I agree with the president on that point [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=305.59999999999997s)]
*  So not at all surprising that he couldn't even say you didn't mention but he couldn't even tell Mike Turner my former [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=308.03999999999996s)]
*  You know chairman of the of the intelligence [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=314.79999999999995s)]
*  He couldn't even tell Mike Turner that the Pentagon didn't have plans to attack Greenland because of course he can't [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=317.08s)]
*  Yeah, and certainly there have been a lot of questions raised about that Greenland and Panama from that hearing the other day ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=322.68s)]
*  Democratic Congress and Jim Himes of Connecticut. Thank you. We always appreciate you coming in [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=330.24s)]
*  You [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p72OaG-3AQ&t=352.12s)]
