# 'No idea what she's doing': House Dem slams Kristi Noem over Texas flooding response
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [July 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4)
*  So as we mentioned, President Trump will depart for the Texas Hill country a few minutes from [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=0.0s)]
*  now where he will meet with first responders and the families impacted by last Friday's [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=5.2s)]
*  catastrophic flooding. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=11.700000000000001s)]
*  This comes as Democratic lawmakers are raising concerns about the federal response in the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=13.52s)]
*  wake of the storm and questioning how the administration's cuts to FEMA and the National [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=17.86s)]
*  Weather Service may impact future disasters. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=23.88s)]
*  Joining us now, Democratic Congressman Jared Moskowitz of Florida. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=28.0s)]
*  And Congressman Moskowitz previously served as Florida's Director of Emergency Management. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=32.52s)]
*  So I wanted to get your insights. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=38.56s)]
*  I'm sure you have a lot of thoughts on not just the response to the catastrophe in Texas, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=40.44s)]
*  but also the attitudes and changes and cuts toward these federal programs. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=47.44s)]
*  Yeah, first, let me say obviously the devastation out of Texas is on a level of, you know, heartbreak. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=54.0s)]
*  You're talking 120 people, 36 kids, and a lot of people are still missing. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  I mean, this is one of the worst floods in modern time. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=68.4s)]
*  And so obviously our heartbreaks for the community that's experienced this. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=72.62s)]
*  I mean, but at the same time, this is what government is for. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=78.88s)]
*  Government is supposed to be there in your time of need. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=82.88s)]
*  Government is supposed to help when there are these major disasters that are over the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=85.88s)]
*  capacity of local governments. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  That's what FEMA is for. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=93.2s)]
*  And the reports coming out that FEMA didn't show up with Swiftwater rescue crews for 72 [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=95.7s)]
*  hours is a total deviation from how FEMA worked when I was the Director of Emergency [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=100.28s)]
*  Management in Florida. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  I would have been woken up by my regional administrator in the middle of the night, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  by the way, Florida right now doesn't have a FEMA regional administrator that positions [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=111.48s)]
*  empty because they were forced out, along with over 20 percent of FEMA's workforce. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=115.92s)]
*  There would have been Black Hawk helicopters that would have been moved by FEMA for search [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=122.64s)]
*  and rescue. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=127.04s)]
*  They would have had Task Force One and Task Force Two that would have been mobilized within [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=128.04s)]
*  24 hours on the site. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=132.12s)]
*  For 72 hours, unfortunately, search and rescue, them showing up then is just not as needed [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=134.20000000000002s)]
*  at that critical moment. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=143.2s)]
*  So you're describing what would have happened had this been under your jurisdiction. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=146.2s)]
*  How would you describe the response in Texas as it was? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=151.7s)]
*  Kristi Noem doesn't know what she's doing. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=155.88s)]
*  She has no idea what she is doing when it comes to FEMA. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=157.52s)]
*  Look, FEMA needed reform. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=162.35999999999999s)]
*  The emergency management industry has been saying that for a long period of time. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  I have a bill with Byron Donalds, who's running for Governor of Florida, to take FEMA out [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=166.35999999999999s)]
*  of Homeland because we want FEMA to be faster. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=171.16s)]
*  Homeland is a giant bureaucracy with 22 other agencies. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=174.56s)]
*  They're disabusing FEMA, making it do with the grants of all the other agencies within [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=177.64s)]
*  Homeland. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=182.16s)]
*  So it needed reform, but that's not what the Secretary did. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=183.16s)]
*  What she did is she broke it. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=186.6s)]
*  She broke it on purpose so that when it fails this summer, she can say, oh, see, we told [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=189.32000000000002s)]
*  you FEMA doesn't work. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=194.84s)]
*  But I actually don't think people in the West Wing know how bad FEMA is, know how bad what [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=196.64000000000001s)]
*  she's done to FEMA. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=202.28s)]
*  She's appointed an interim administrator with zero emergency management experience. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=204.56s)]
*  That was on purpose because she doesn't want anything to happen unless it comes to her [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=209.34s)]
*  desk. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=213.56s)]
*  And she made FEMA slower, less efficient, so much for the e-endos for what she's done [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=214.56s)]
*  to FEMA. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=220.28s)]
*  And it's going to cost lives. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=221.28s)]
*  And it's going to hurt red states more than anybody else. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=223.28s)]
*  Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, I mean, Kentucky, Kansas, places [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=226.36s)]
*  that have tornadoes. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=234.12s)]
*  I mean, this is not good for states that would go bankrupt without FEMA. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=235.56s)]
*  And they've slowed down the reimbursement process to the slowest it's ever been. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=241.0s)]
*  Well, when you slow down reimbursement, you slow down resources, that means cities and [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=246.36s)]
*  counties slow down their decisions because they don't know if they're going to get reimbursed. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=250.28s)]
*  And they don't have the funds to do major disaster cleanup. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=254.88s)]
*  So this is a total disaster going into hurricane season. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=259.4s)]
*  Let's just pray we get lucky and we don't have a bad hurricane season. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=264.48s)]
*  But if we do, I think you could see a Michael Brown moment. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=268.68s)]
*  So, Congressman, you took me exactly where I wanted to take the next slide of questioning. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=272.48s)]
*  Is hurricane season about to arrive? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=276.36s)]
*  You just listed a lot of states that are traditionally in the path of hurricanes. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=279.04s)]
*  Of course, Florida, your home state, right there as well. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=282.24s)]
*  So in the interim, as you've raised a lot of concerns here about FEMA, is there anything [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=285.44s)]
*  that Congress can do right now to try to mitigate what you're saying are the dangerous cuts [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=290.52s)]
*  from the administration? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=295.4s)]
*  Oh, Congress could have done a lot of things in the last eight months on this topic. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=297.12s)]
*  I've had dozens of conversations with members and, you know, they've been dialoguing with [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=302.44s)]
*  their relationships in Homeland and in the White House. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=308.84s)]
*  But the secretary has already caused the damage, right? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=313.64s)]
*  It's easy to break things. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=318.76s)]
*  It's much harder to fix that. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=319.84s)]
*  And so they're scrambling now, OK, to try to get FEMA now ready for hurricane season. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=321.52s)]
*  But there's too many positions that are empty. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=327.15999999999997s)]
*  There's too much experience that has left. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=329.2s)]
*  And everyone there is afraid to make a decision because they'll get fired. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=331.65999999999997s)]
*  And all the decisions have to go up to the secretary. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=335.14s)]
*  And so, yeah, what can Speaker Johnson do being from Louisiana? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=338.44s)]
*  What can Steve Scalise do being from Louisiana? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=342.12s)]
*  They can be making sure they're pushing the White House to get FEMA ready, to get those [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=345.02s)]
*  declarations fast, to do pre-landfall declarations. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=350.9s)]
*  That's what we're used to when a hurricane is coming three, four days before. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=354.82s)]
*  They do a pre-landfall declaration, which allows them to move logistics. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=358.03999999999996s)]
*  It allows the locals to know they're getting reimbursed. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=362.29999999999995s)]
*  You know, it allows you to pre-position resources in the field, ice, water, power generation. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=365.64s)]
*  It allows you to do all those things. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=371.29999999999995s)]
*  FEMA needs to go to the playbook that they know and works in hurricane season. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=372.7s)]
*  So those members should talk up publicly and shouldn't be afraid because if we do get [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=379.38s)]
*  a bad hurricane season, it's going to come to their districts. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=384.74s)]
*  There are more Republican districts that are exposed to hurricanes than Democratic districts. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=389.14s)]
*  Yeah, I was actually in coastal South Carolina last weekend as a tropical storm moved in. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=395.86s)]
*  It ended up being not a big deal, but there was a sense of who residents I talked to embracing [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=400.14s)]
*  themselves as to what the months ahead may hold. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=404.52s)]
*  Congressman Jared Moskowitz of Florida, thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ywmFPFqma4&t=408.3s)]
