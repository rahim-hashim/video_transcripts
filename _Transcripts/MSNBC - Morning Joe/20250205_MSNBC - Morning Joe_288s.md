**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k)
*  Joining us now we have member of the New York Times editorial board Mara Gaye former MSNBC host and contributor to Washington Monthly [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=0.0s)]
*  Chris Matthews Chris [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=7.28s)]
*  I'll start with you. I'm [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=10.48s)]
*  Yeah, so I'm curious how you're feeling right now about everything well [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=13.88s)]
*  What you and John has been saying since the early this morning? I think it's the craziest idea [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=18.64s)]
*  I've ever heard in my life two million people living in Gaza a [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=23.54s)]
*  Problem that Israel has and now we're gonna have we want to own Gaza [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=27.62s)]
*  We want to take those two million people and somehow lure them to go to a Jordan or to Egypt neither of those countries want them [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=32.1s)]
*  Imagine Jordan it's already overwhelmed with 60% of its country are our meds who come from the Palestinian areas [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=39.620000000000005s)]
*  They don't need any more trouble. They don't need a mosque in their country [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=46.260000000000005s)]
*  Hamas Hamas is now gonna move to Egypt and to Jordan destroy those countries [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=50.06s)]
*  By the way, it's also gonna offer become a new hospitality center along the Mediterranean [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=54.9s)]
*  I mean give me a break [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=61.38s)]
*  Hamas is not gonna be good wherever he goes [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=62.94s)]
*  It's gonna continue to be trouble wherever he goes and wherever he goes is gonna probably topple the government and for the president to say [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=65.78s)]
*  We won't use troops. Of course, we use [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=73.74000000000001s)]
*  imagine American service people's [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=76.38s)]
*  families [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=78.7s)]
*  Realizing their son or daughter has been sent to Gaza [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=79.7s)]
*  Right in the middle of the Mideast fighting we have avoided wars over there in 48 56 67 [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=83.26s)]
*  73 now we're getting right into the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=89.94s)]
*  Israeli Arab war right in the middle of it [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=92.94s)]
*  We're taking sides with Israel against the Arabs in and Gaza and we're telling them to leave like there are an indigenous [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=95.98s)]
*  Population in the United States back in the 19th century. We're gonna move them out move to some other place [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=102.98s)]
*  Against their will it's horrible and what's gonna be a war [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=109.02000000000001s)]
*  And I don't understand why he's doing this. I think it's the wackiest idea. So hard to say he's ever come up with [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=112.66000000000001s)]
*  So one thought Senator Chris Murphy was talking earlier in our show is that this is a distraction I would [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=120.14s)]
*  Meld what you're saying with what he's saying and saying this is amusing [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=127.02000000000001s)]
*  Concept he's come up with beach beach front property [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=132.14000000000001s)]
*  Something well within his purview of interest and the way he would talk about something like that [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=135.98000000000002s)]
*  that could have immediate consequences to the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=142.5s)]
*  Immediate situation the ceasefire that's going on [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=146.22s)]
*  But I also agree it could be a distraction to what is going on right now in our government and Chris [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=148.82s)]
*  I'll follow up with you and then I want to hear from Mara gay Lamar. You can take it tomorrow [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=156.2s)]
*  about the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=161.5s)]
*  The folks who are being told they're immediately on leave as a Friday at USA ID and the FBI [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=163.42s)]
*  Agents who investigated gen 6 right now in the fight for their careers some of them suing [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=169.23999999999998s)]

*  Fighting AIDS and Africa rise sir for a couple years. The Peace Corps is extraordinarily popular [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=181.32s)]
*  It's one of the good things we do in the world the idea of bringing an Atlantic City [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=186.28s)]
*  To a gas is crazy. By the way, go to the Atlantic City [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=192.35999999999999s)]

*  Take a look at the old Atlantic City and where that ended up. It didn't work. It works in Vegas [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=206.68s)]
*  It didn't work in Atlantic City and now he wants to create this Mecca with Hamas becoming hospitality [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=211.68s)]
*  People as waiters and stuff like that and and and chambermaids. Are you crazy? This is a crazy idea [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=218.44s)]

*  Oh, no, we're gonna have American [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=235.01999999999998s)]

*  You know the idea is definitely triggering and it's upsetting and a lot of people are responding with shock and disbelief and [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=250.6s)]
*  I think you know [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAhiMPqIH6k&t=258.88s)]
