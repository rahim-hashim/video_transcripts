# 'A ninth-inning ask': Why Trump wants a whole new tax bracket
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM)
*  On his show, House Republicans are facing a new roadblock as the party looks to craft [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=0.0s)]
*  a bill focused on President Trump's legislative priorities. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  The president now pushing to create a new tax bracket, as we mentioned, for the highest [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  earners in America. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=12.32s)]
*  Under Trump's proposal, the wealthiest would see their tax rate increase to nearly 40 percent. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=13.84s)]
*  Joining us now, one of the reporters who first broke this story, co-founder of Punchbowl [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=19.04s)]
*  News, Jake Sherman. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=23.12s)]
*  Jake, great to have you back on the show. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=24.6s)]
*  What more can you tell us about this idea? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  This is a late game addition, Willie. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=29.24s)]
*  This is a nine-pinning ask from the president to create an entirely new tax bracket for [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=31.099999999999998s)]
*  people making, individuals making two and a half million, couples making five, married [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=36.72s)]
*  couples making five million dollars. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=41.28s)]
*  This would set that rate at 39.6 percent, which is the old top rate for top earners, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=43.72s)]
*  which was phased out in 2017 when the tax bill was put into place. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=50.08s)]
*  You know, I'm hesitant to say this doesn't have a chance because it might. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=55.28s)]
*  I've been skeptical all along that Trump could raise the top rate, but he seems to be here [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=61.08s)]
*  setting it high enough that people would be hesitant to vote against it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=66.08s)]
*  We'll have to see, A, if the leadership goes along, B, if the Senate and House go along. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=72.6s)]
*  But a few notes on the politics, Willie, which is number one, this is a bill that has pretty [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=77.56s)]
*  steep cuts to entitlement programs and to federal spending across the board. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=83.52s)]
*  So if if you could find a way to take away the Democrats' argument that they're just [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=87.75999999999999s)]
*  raising taxes for the rich and paying for it by cutting by cutting spending programs, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=92.32s)]
*  that's probably a useful dynamic for you. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=99.0s)]
*  But again, this is so late in the game, they're marking up this bill extensively next week. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=101.88s)]
*  So I think it's it's quite late. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=107.84s)]
*  That's not a surprise for Donald Trump, who seems to tune into these things quite late. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=111.2s)]
*  But but, you know, it's a bit of a mess right now. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=115.4s)]
*  Jake, it's Ali Vitale. I wonder if you can talk a little bit about the balancing act [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=119.64s)]
*  that the speaker is doing here, because we know that's how they're going to actually [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=123.0s)]
*  figure out what ends up in and out of the bill on this kind of a proposal. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=126.04s)]
*  Of course, it strikes me that it would earn the support of people who want to see the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=130.36s)]
*  government be able to pay for a lot of what's in this bill. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=134.4s)]
*  But talk about that balancing act dynamic. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=137.84s)]
*  Who does this earn them? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=139.76s)]
*  Who does this lose them on the Republican side? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=140.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's a fair question, which is that it will it will lose them. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=143.88s)]
*  Quite honestly, it's a bit unpredictable because traditionally the orthodoxy is that [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=149.04000000000002s)]
*  Republicans don't want to don't want to raise taxes on anybody. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  And they feel like this is this grows the economy to keep taxes low. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=157.72s)]
*  And I think, to be honest with you, that Trump could get the House Republicans to do [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=161.52s)]
*  effectively anything he wants, even break longstanding Republican orthodoxy. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=166.6s)]
*  And I think the larger problem is this bill is all but assembled and and asking them [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=171.44s)]
*  to go back and to make changes. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=178.48s)]
*  And other things Trump asked for yesterday were or Wednesday, rather, were closing the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=181.52s)]
*  carried interest loophole, which is a very divisive topic on Capitol Hill. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=187.48000000000002s)]
*  The way hedge fund managers get paid and get taxed. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=191.68s)]
*  That's number one. And number two, create some sort of baby bonds program or a [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=194.44s)]
*  savings bond for babies who are born in the United States. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=199.84s)]
*  These are policies that if the if the White House really wanted, should have made part [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=204.0s)]
*  of their red line months and months ago, not three or four days before a markup on a [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=208.36s)]
*  piece of legislation that's just gigantic. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=214.04000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, you know, Jake, let's just talk, though, about carried interest for a second. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=217.4s)]
*  That is an issue, again, that that is is deeply divisive, not only in the Republican [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=220.28s)]
*  Party, but also you start talking to Democratic candidates. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=228.0s)]
*  Most of their donors care very much about carried interest. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=231.36s)]
*  The richest among us do not want the carried interest loophole closed. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  Talk about how remarkable it is that you even have a president from the Republican [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=240.0s)]
*  side talking about an issue that Democrats didn't even have the courage to touch when [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=244.44s)]
*  they were running the Ways and Means Committee. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=249.52s)]
*  That's right. And by the way, you'll remember that Joe Biden tried to do it and was [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=252.20000000000002s)]
*  rebuffed by his party in a in a pretty meaningful way. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=257.44s)]
*  It's remarkable because a lot of people who benefit from carried interest, not only [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=262.28000000000003s)]
*  hedge funds, not only private equity managers, not only people in finance, but also oil [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=267.36s)]
*  and gas and people in industries kind of across the ideological and economic [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=273.2s)]
*  spectrum. It is remarkable. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=280.96s)]
*  And I think it's so remarkable that that it's going to have a really tough time [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=283.15999999999997s)]
*  getting through. I mean, remember, Joe, I want to just restate this. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=286.88s)]
*  All of these issues, raising the top or creating a new top bracket, closing the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=289.68s)]
*  carried interest loophole. These are legislative items that [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=294.24s)]
*  Mike Johnson and John Thune have both said they're not interested in. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=300.2s)]
*  I mean, you are going against the leadership of your party, which is very difficult, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=305.28s)]
*  especially again at this late stage of the game. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=309.2s)]
*  Rare are the occasions when they don't give Donald Trump what he wants. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=312.92s)]
*  We'll see if that changes this time. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=316.12s)]
*  Co-founder of Punchbowl News, Jake Sherman. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=317.44s)]
*  Jake, thanks so much as always. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjU4sA05AM&t=320.36s)]
