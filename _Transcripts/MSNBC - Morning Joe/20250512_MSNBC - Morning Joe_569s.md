# More delays, cancellations: Newark Airport suffers third outage in two weeks
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY)
*  Do you want to know who did not have a very good weekend? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=0.0s)]
*  A very spectacular weekend? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=6.8s)]
*  Everybody that was trying to find a New York, and you know, we suspect you had three of [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=10.16s)]
*  your four kids with you because they couldn't get out because I tried to get out yesterday [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=16.1s)]
*  to New York. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=23.92s)]
*  It did not happen. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=25.0s)]
*  A mess across the East Coast. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=27.3s)]
*  This really is getting critical. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=29.62s)]
*  The first time we had a blackout at Newark, they said, oh, it's old frayed coils. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=33.04s)]
*  Well, have we had old frayed coils two more times? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=38.9s)]
*  I mean, it's a, it is, I have always been the person telling my friends and loved ones, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=42.42s)]
*  flying, safest thing to do in the world. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=48.5s)]
*  The numbers are extraordinary. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=51.34s)]
*  Please just relax. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=53.5s)]
*  Get on your flight. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=54.5s)]
*  It's still by far the safest, but Katty, there's no doubt we have a crisis in our system and [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=56.76s)]
*  our air safety system. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=66.52s)]
*  Yeah, we would think you might need an infrastructure week for this one. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=68.52s)]
*  Newark International Airport, by the way, guys, experienced another telecommunications outage [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=71.52s)]
*  yesterday. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=76.56s)]
*  This marks the third incident in two weeks following a brief radar and radio blackout [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=77.74000000000001s)]
*  on April the 28th and a similar outage on Friday as well. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=82.52s)]
*  Yesterday's equipment failure led to a 45-minute ground stop at Newark, kicking off even more [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=86.67999999999999s)]
*  delays, even more cancellations. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=92.19999999999999s)]
*  U.S. airlines are now expected to meet with the FAA this week to discuss cutting flights [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=94.75999999999999s)]
*  in and out of the airport. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=100.6s)]
*  Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said yesterday that Newark will operate at reduced capacity [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=102.86s)]
*  for several weeks to avoid further delays. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=107.19999999999999s)]
*  In an interview on Meet the Press, he insisted flying is safe right now. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=110.04s)]
*  The equipment that we use, much of it we can't buy parts for new. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=116.32s)]
*  We have to go on eBay and buy parts if one part goes down. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=120.12s)]
*  You're dealing with really old equipment. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=123.68s)]
*  We're dealing with copper wires, not fiber, not high-speed fiber. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=125.0s)]
*  And so this is concerning. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=129.4s)]
*  Is it safe? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=132.36s)]
*  Yes, we have redundancies, multiple redundancies in place to keep you safe when you fly. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=133.36s)]
*  But we should also recognize we're seeing stress on an old network, and it's time to [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=138.4s)]
*  fix it. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=143.08s)]
*  You know, John Lemire, I'm curious what the White House, how aggressive this White House [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=144.08s)]
*  is going to be. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=152.44000000000003s)]
*  This has been a crisis for 20 years, 25 years, as Steve Ratner pointed out last week. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=153.8s)]
*  And Congress hasn't moved on it. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=159.14000000000001s)]
*  Presidents throughout this century haven't moved on it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=161.32000000000002s)]
*  We have an old, fraying, decrepit system. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=164.32000000000002s)]
*  It's something that we've been warned about for years by Steve Ratner. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=166.92s)]
*  It's something we talked about COVID and post-COVID. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=171.72s)]
*  And now it's upon us. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=175.04s)]
*  The question is, will Congress get serious and, you know, there's been so many infrastructure [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=176.48s)]
*  cuts through the years on the state, local level especially. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=183.5s)]
*  But do you get a sense that the Trump administration and Sean Duffy understand that they're going [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=188.12s)]
*  to finally have to do what other presidents and congresses haven't done over the past [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=194.32s)]
*  25 years? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=199.4s)]
*  I mean, this was not on their original to-do list, but it's rapidly climbing up the ranks [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=200.4s)]
*  of their priorities. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=205.95999999999998s)]
*  Let's recall, of course, when there was that accident at DCA at Washington National Airport [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=206.95999999999998s)]
*  back in January, the first couple days of President Trump's term. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=212.32s)]
*  The reaction was even from the president himself and the White House brief room to blame DEI, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=217.07999999999998s)]
*  to blame hiring practices under the Biden administration, to basically point the finger [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=221.04s)]
*  elsewhere what was a tragic accident. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=225.35999999999999s)]
*  But what we've seen since is the number of these incidents increase that they've had [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=228.07999999999998s)]
*  to take it more seriously. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=233.95999999999998s)]
*  And we've reached that tipping point this past week at Newark, where we've had these [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=235.12s)]
*  multiple stops, real concerns about aviation safety, passengers rattled. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=238.72s)]
*  This is Newark, of course, one of the busiest airports in the country. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=244.16s)]
*  We've seen Secretary Duffy be deployed on a number of talk shows in the last couple [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=248.16s)]
*  of days pledging the administration will take this on. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=253.24s)]
*  Now, they've got a lot on their plate right now as we're going to go dive through all [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=257.84000000000003s)]
*  morning long with trade deals and the president's overseas trip and the like. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=260.8s)]
*  But this is going to have to be part of the issue too, Caddy, because they understand [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=265.92s)]
*  as summer travel season approaches, if this continues to not only not get better, but [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=269.0s)]
*  potentially even get worse. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=274.32s)]
*  It's going to cripple air travel, which is going to have not just impact potential passenger [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=275.92s)]
*  safety, but have a triple down effect for the economy, which, of course, President Trump [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=282.0s)]
*  cares so deeply about. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=287.32s)]
*  So this is something we'll have to see what sort of relationship push they have with the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=289.24s)]
*  Hill. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=294.2s)]
*  But they are now in the last few days realizing, hey, this is something we've got to take [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=295.2s)]
*  on. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=298.36s)]
*  Yeah, Newark, of course, United's hub. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=299.36s)]
*  You can imagine there is a lot of pressure on the White House from United and the other [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=300.8s)]
*  airlines as well. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=304.48s)]
*  Joining us now, associate professor of air traffic management at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=305.48s)]
*  University, Michael McCormick. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=310.84000000000003s)]
*  He is former vice president of the FAA air traffic organization. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=312.48s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us, Mr. McCormick. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=316.34000000000003s)]
*  How does America's airport infrastructure compare to other major economies' airport [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=319.44s)]
*  infrastructure? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=326.48s)]
*  My sense is I travel a lot around the world and I come back here and I feel like I'm coming [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=328.16s)]
*  into a crumbling airport system. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=331.6s)]
*  Morning, Katty. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=334.28000000000003s)]
*  Thanks for having me on. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=335.28000000000003s)]
*  The airport infrastructure in the United States is complex. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=338.24s)]
*  It's by far the largest in the world. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=341.8s)]
*  So as you can expect, it takes a lot of support, a lot of funding in order to maintain and [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=345.08000000000004s)]
*  modernize and upgrade the airport system in the United States. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=353.64s)]
*  And what is different about the U.S. versus other countries is that the U.S. airport infrastructure [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=359.59999999999997s)]
*  is heavily funded by federal government through the airport improvement program, which those [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=367.12s)]
*  ticket taxes that you pay every time you fly, a portion of that goes to funding of that [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=375.56s)]
*  airport infrastructure. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=380.71999999999997s)]
*  You've had stories a lot about air traffic controllers and the relatively low mandatory [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=381.8s)]
*  retirement age. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=389.56s)]
*  We heard Sean Duffy over the weekend saying that a bunch of air traffic controllers had [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=390.56s)]
*  actually left from Newark just in recent days because of the problems at Newark airport. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=394.92s)]
*  So is this not just an air traffic infrastructure problem but also a personnel problem? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=400.72s)]
*  And shouldn't that be relatively easy to fix? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=407.16s)]
*  You're correct, Katie, that the staffing levels for air traffic controllers in the United [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=412.52000000000004s)]
*  States has reached a critical level. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=417.64000000000004s)]
*  The United States is over 3,000 controllers short of where they need to be in terms of [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=420.68s)]
*  their staffing. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=425.36s)]
*  However, it's not an easy fix because the Federal Aviation Administration's Academy [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=426.36s)]
*  can only handle about 1,800 trainees per year. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=432.34000000000003s)]
*  So you can see that there's a big gap between how many need to be hired and how many can [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=439.44s)]
*  be hired and trained. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=444.96s)]
*  In addition to that, once through the Academy, it takes one to five years to fully certify [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=446.56s)]
*  as a controller. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=453.24s)]
*  So there isn't a quick fix. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=454.62s)]
*  However, there are ways that in the short term, there can be things done such as providing [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=456.68s)]
*  incentives for controllers to not retire, to stay within the system when they're eligible, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=462.64s)]
*  but they haven't reached that mandatory age, 55 retirement age. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=469.52s)]
*  Additionally, there can be incentives to bring controllers to facilities set up in poor-rentally [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=473.56s)]
*  or to staff in terms of control by numbers. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=479.44s)]
*  This is David Ignatius in Washington. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=483.03999999999996s)]
*  I wanted to ask how long it's going to be before this air traffic control problem. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=484.91999999999996s)]
*  I want to say mess begins to have real economic effects for the United States. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=492.08s)]
*  Do you think we're nearing that point where we'll see a real difficulty in moving things [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=497.4s)]
*  from one place to another? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=502.4s)]
*  I think we're seeing part of that today. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=505.08s)]
*  And there is an axiom within the aviation industry, and that is however New York goes, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmmwZei6jhY&t=507.64s)]
