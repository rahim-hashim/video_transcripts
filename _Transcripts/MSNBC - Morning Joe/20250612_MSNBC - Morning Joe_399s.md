# 'Hoodwinked and arrested': ICE targeting asylum seekers following lawful process: House member
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8)
*  As the Trump administration ramps up its deportation efforts, as we're discussing, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=0.0s)]
*  one New York lawmaker says he witnessed it firsthand. Video shows Democratic Congressman [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=4.16s)]
*  Dan Goldman confronting ICE agents back in May in a federal building that houses both his office [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=9.6s)]
*  as well as an immigration court. Goldman says that the agents wore plain clothes and masks [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  as they arrested asylum seekers who were there for routine court appearances. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=22.32s)]
*  Congressman Goldman joins us now. He's a member of the House Judiciary and Homeland Security [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=27.2s)]
*  Committees. Congressman, good to see you. Let's start right there. First of all, the tactics these [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=31.92s)]
*  ICE agents are using, wearing masks, even though President Trump on an daily basis is telling [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=36.64s)]
*  protesters not to wear masks, ICE agents seem to be allowed to do so. Also, where they tried to make [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=41.6s)]
*  these arrests and therefore started the deportation process, at immigration court, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=47.68s)]
*  people who are trying to do the right thing by checking in or whatever process they have right [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=52.88s)]
*  now and instead they're maybe afraid to do so. Talk to us about what you saw that day. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=58.72s)]
*  Well, what's going on is this new policy that Stephen Miller has orchestrated, which is designed [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=65.44s)]
*  solely to increase the number of deportations. And while Donald Trump promised to go after [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=71.36s)]
*  convicted criminals and the worst of the worst, he's doing the exact opposite. What the Department [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=76.88s)]
*  of Homeland Security is doing is they're going into court, they're dismissing their own case, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=81.84s)]
*  a removal case against immigrants. In many of those cases, the immigrants have done what they're [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=87.12s)]
*  legally allowed to do, which is to file asylum claims. Asylum is a lawful pathway to come into [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=93.2s)]
*  the United States. The Department of Homeland Security is dismissing their own cases, which [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=98.4s)]
*  voids out the asylum claim. The immigrants are then leaving court, going downstairs into the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=103.84s)]
*  lobby of the building where my district office is, and there are a number of ICE agents, plain clothes, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=112.16s)]
*  unidentified, wearing masks, who arrest them and send them into a different removal proceeding [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  called expedited removal, where there's minimal due process and there's not enough time for them [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  to refile their asylum claim. So these are people following lawful process, following the proper [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=129.04s)]
*  immigration proceedings for people who are seeking asylum, which is a lawful pathway. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=137.36s)]
*  And instead, what's happening is they're being hoodwinked, essentially, and arrested. So these [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=143.84s)]
*  are people doing it the right way, who are nonviolent, non-criminal, and they're getting [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=150.08s)]
*  arrested. So what message does that send? Obviously, it sends the message, don't do things the right way. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=154.88000000000002s)]
*  Go further underground. Don't appear in court. Don't follow lawful process. Don't pay your taxes, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  because many have work visas. And that's just going to make the public less safe. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=166.56s)]
*  Congressman, NBC News is reporting that now these tactical units are going to be expanded [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=174.96s)]
*  into cities like Chicago, Northern Virginia, New York, and other places in Northern Virginia, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=183.12s)]
*  I will note, that will include going into the D.C. area over the next couple of days to ramp up [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=189.2s)]
*  these what can only be described as snatch and grabs. Is this legal? These nondescript [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=196.16s)]
*  individuals who we can only assume are federal agents, but as you noted, the federal agents in [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=204.16s)]
*  the courthouse in the federal building you were in, did not have any insignia to say who they were [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=209.92s)]
*  with. Is this a legal thing that is happening to folks across the country? And I will note, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=217.12s)]
*  it's not just the Latino or Hispanic community. We're talking about Haitians, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=221.52s)]
*  literally anyone who is not an American citizen, and in some instances, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=225.76s)]
*  actual Americans who just fit the profile. Yeah, I mean, there are a lot of issues here. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=229.68s)]
*  There's equal protection issues, due process issues under the Constitution. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=237.12s)]
*  Whether or not they're following the protocols of the federal government, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=243.04s)]
*  I will be introducing a bill that will prevent Homeland Security officers from [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=247.84s)]
*  hiding or concealing their identities and wearing masks, because we don't live in a country, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=255.2s)]
*  an authoritarian country, where we have secret police who are masked, who are intimidating, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=262.4s)]
*  who are scaring people. That's the stuff of authoritarian states. That is not the stuff of [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=270.24s)]
*  the United States. That's not how the United States operates. And that's really where this is [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=277.04s)]
*  breaking down, is the combination of these Gestapo-like tactics with the fact that these [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=282.88000000000005s)]
*  are nonviolent, non-criminal immigrants doing things the right way. And that's why you're [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=291.92s)]
*  seeing protests all around the country. It's not that they're protesting that people who have [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  convictions are being removed. They're protesting that they're going after all of our communities, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=302.40000000000003s)]
*  and they're undermining the legal process. If you want to reform asylum, come talk to me. I would [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=309.36s)]
*  love to do that. It's a broken process. But we have to follow the law, and Donald Trump is not [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=314.88s)]
*  following the law. He is inciting more fear, more intimidation. He's using more intimidation, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=321.52000000000004s)]
*  and he is trying to inflame a problem so that he can, in my view, say that this is an insurrection [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=327.6s)]
*  and that he can essentially say that the United States is a victim of some invasion and insurrection, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=336.56s)]
*  which is completely bogus. But that's where he's going with this. And he's trying to make things [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=343.28000000000003s)]
*  worse with, I think, illegally sending in the military, which clearly violates the Posse Comitatus [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=348.40000000000003s)]
*  Act. And that's the problem that he's going to run into. And there's a court appearance today [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=355.6s)]
*  where we'll get some, set some light on that. And to your point, President Trump has mused [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=360.64000000000004s)]
*  repeatedly in recent days about possibly calling for the Insurrection Act, evoking it in Los Angeles. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=365.76000000000005s)]
*  We, of course, will be watching that. Democratic Congressman Dan Goldman of New York. Congressman, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=372.64000000000004s)]
*  thank you. Thank you. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kAoQYqdgM8&t=376.8s)]
