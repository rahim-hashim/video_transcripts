# 'Decisive decision': Senator Murkowski reacts to strikes in Iran
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA)
*  that because of the president's decisive action we have severely damaged Iran's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=0.0s)]
*  critical nuclear infrastructure. I think we have to be prepared for Iran to [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=5.4s)]
*  retaliate and I joined the president in his warning to the supreme leader of [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=9.3s)]
*  Iran that if he targets Americans the military force he will see will make [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=13.88s)]
*  last night look like child's play. There was no imminent threat to the [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=18.52s)]
*  United States from this nuclear program. It was an offensive war of choice by a [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=24.2s)]
*  president without consultation with Congress. I fear deeply we're being [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=28.56s)]
*  misled about this just as we were before we tragically got into a war with Iraq. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=32.4s)]
*  Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle reacting to the US military strikes [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=37.04s)]
*  against Iran with us now Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. She's [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=41.44s)]
*  the author of the new book titled Far From Home. An Alaska senator faces the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=46.0s)]
*  extreme climate of Washington DC and how much more extreme it's gotten lately. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=50.96s)]
*  We'll get to the book in a moment. Thank you so much for being with us Senator. I [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=57.76s)]
*  just wanted to read what you had said about the strikes. President Trump's [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  decision to carry out focused strikes on Iran's nuclear infrastructure makes [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=65.44s)]
*  clear that the international community will not tolerate a nuclear armed Iran. I [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=69.92s)]
*  commend all those who executed this mission with precision and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=74.56s)]
*  professionalism. We've been quoting on morning the UN and the IAEA report that [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=77.92s)]
*  Iran may have had enough uranium within a couple of weeks to create several [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=84.32000000000001s)]
*  weapons. Talk about the dangers that that would present and if that's why you [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  supported these strikes. I think we do recognize clearly these are these are [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  dangers that we don't even we don't even want to dream about because of the [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=104.16000000000001s)]
*  potential and the threat that exists. So what we saw over the weekend was we [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=109.76s)]
*  saw a commander in chief who made a very decisive decision to go after Iran's [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=114.48s)]
*  nuclear capabilities. I think it is yet to be seen exactly how much we were able [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=121.92s)]
*  to to contain that. We're going to be learning a little bit more but I think [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  it was it was presented to us that we're still determining the extent of the of [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=134.48000000000002s)]
*  the of the damage and and and thus how much remains to be to be dealt with. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=141.84s)]
*  What should the Senate learn next from the White House? What would you like in [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=149.04000000000002s)]
*  the briefings? What would you like the White House to have you all read it on? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=154.8s)]
*  Well this this briefing is coming up Tuesday. We'll have an opportunity to to [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=161.51999999999998s)]
*  be read into the details of course of the strike but I'm hoping to to learn a [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=167.44s)]
*  little bit more about just the the legal justification as well as the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=172.88s)]
*  the matters to which the administration the president looked to that that led to [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=181.92s)]
*  again a very I think well orchestrated and again a very targeted decisive strike [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=189.6s)]
*  against these three three locations. So we won't know everything but I think [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=197.44s)]
*  what we're expecting what I'm hoping for is is a is a full disclosure to us about [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=203.6s)]
*  what allowed them to proceed with the confidence that they did. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=211.52s)]
*  So Senator we heard from President Trump's a few moments ago just a moment all caps [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=215.84s)]
*  two social posts concerned about oil prices so that's certainly front of mind as well. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=222.0s)]
*  Let's turn now if we could to in there we see it on the screen let's turn now to the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=227.44s)]
*  so-called one big beautiful bill which has been sort of pushed to the side a little bit [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  because of what's had been happening in the Middle East. There had been a hope to get this done by [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=236.07999999999998s)]
*  July 4th that seems the clock is ticking towards that and there are a lot of hurdles that still [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=240.0s)]
*  need to be cleared in the Senate. Talk to us if you will about where you think things stand but [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=245.76s)]
*  also your concerns about this about this piece of legislation. I know you've deemed it aggressive [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=249.92s)]
*  in terms of some of its spending cuts. So where we are right now the the news of course has been [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=255.35999999999999s)]
*  focused on Iran but I think it is fair to say that throughout the weekend many of the teams were [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=262.4s)]
*  working to determine where things were in the parliamentarian process where things are are [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=269.36s)]
*  kicked out if they don't meet our reconciliation rules. That is still in process. I think it's [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=276.0s)]
*  going to take another couple days so we're not going to be in a position to actually have the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=282.24s)]
*  text as members to to really know everyone wants to know what are you going to how are you going [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=287.2s)]
*  to vote on it. Well let's define what it is clearly that is still in process and we'll know [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=293.2s)]
*  we're going to be pushing up against some really aggressive deadlines. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=304.56s)]
*  Leader Thune has made very clear he wants to stick with July 4th. I am one that would rather [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=308.88s)]
*  focus on good policy rather than trying to meet an arbitrary timeline and so if we've got to go [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=315.28000000000003s)]
*  past the 4th of July to get a bill that is good for not just Republicans but for Americans people [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=322.0s)]
*  in Alaska and very remote and rural areas people who are feeling very vulnerable right now let's [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=329.76s)]
*  try to get it right. Senator let's talk about your book and and and your remarkable political career. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=336.48s)]
*  You you are an independent in every sense of the word losing a primary as a Republican running as [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=343.44s)]
*  an independent winning sending a message I think to future Republican and Democratic presidents who [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=349.28s)]
*  worked with you that you you follow you follow your conscience and your line. Talk talk about [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=355.67999999999995s)]
*  your your start in politics and the long and winding road it has taken you down to where you [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=362.79999999999995s)]
*  are right now. All right now how am I supposed to be doing that in a couple minutes here Joe but I [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=369.35999999999996s)]
*  appreciate I appreciate the open ended the open ended question. I didn't set out to be a politician [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=373.84s)]
*  I certainly didn't set out to be a United States senator in many ways I'm kind of that accidental [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=380.71999999999997s)]
*  person who ends up in in a very interesting position but I have managed to navigate now [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=386.64s)]
*  two two decades in the United States Senate and I think it's just because I've been anchored in in [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=394.4s)]
*  who I am and where I'm from my Alaskan this shows through in just about everything that I do every [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=400.0s)]
*  day and representing a very independent constituency people that aren't really so caught up in in the [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=406.56s)]
*  the political rhetoric that goes on but just what is what's important to me and my family and to [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=417.92s)]
*  our state. So it's it's it's more than a little bit extreme here right now in many many ways but [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=424.48s)]
*  how you navigate each day staying focused on the values that brought you here this is what I try [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=433.68s)]
*  to portray in the book. And Senator your willingness to be independent shines through often you are one [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=439.92s)]
*  of the few Republicans who defies the president from time to time and talk to us about the [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=444.88s)]
*  character there of the state. Why do you think being Alaskan leads to that? Is it because of [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=449.68s)]
*  the distance from Washington? Is it because of just the sort of this sense of spirit you have to [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=457.36s)]
*  rely on yourself there because well you're out there kind of on your own. We are on our own in [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=462.88s)]
*  in many senses of the word but geography geography does really help to provide that level of [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=468.0s)]
*  separation but I think that there's a resilience in in the Alaska people you got to figure it out. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=473.68s)]
*  Winters are tough life can be tough and so how you how you make it happen on your own or relying [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=478.56s)]
*  on your neighbors your community is really important and so it's not so much what are the [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=487.28000000000003s)]
*  political values that you can bring to the table but can you fix my my four-wheeler can you can you [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=492.16s)]
*  provide for for fish and and meat in your community. These these are the things that people look at and [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=498.8s)]
*  say now there's real value if you're just a talker not so very impressed so it's very humbling [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=504.8s)]
*  coming from a place like Alaska but again it grounds me it anchors me in a way that is as [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=511.68s)]
*  as genuine as anything that that I could define. The new book Far From Home an Alaska Senator Faces [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=518.72s)]
*  the Extreme Climate of Washington DC is on sale tomorrow. Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=527.12s)]
*  Alaska thank you so much for joining us today good to be with you congratulations on the book. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=533.76s)]
*  you [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOiiKUkCpnA&t=563.76s)]
