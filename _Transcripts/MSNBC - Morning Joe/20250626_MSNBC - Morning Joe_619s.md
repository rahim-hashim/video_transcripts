# Affordability, cost of living the top issue in Virginia, says gubernatorial candidate
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA)
*  A classified Senate briefing regarding last weekend's airstrikes in Iran is set for today, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=0.0s)]
*  after it was postponed earlier in the week. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=6.08s)]
*  Two sources tell NBC News that the White House is expected to send Secretary of State Marco [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=9.52s)]
*  Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, as well as General [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=14.32s)]
*  Dan Kaine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to brief senators. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard will not attend. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=25.36s)]
*  A classified briefing for members in the House of Representatives is set for tomorrow. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=29.2s)]
*  Joining us now, Democratic Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger of Virginia. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=34.84s)]
*  She's the state's Democratic nominee for governor. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=39.2s)]
*  I should also mention in just a few minutes' time, we're going to hear from Secretary of [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=41.72s)]
*  Defense Hegseth, as well as General Kaine, as they brief reporters from the Pentagon. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  We'll keep an eye on that for when it begins. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=49.64s)]
*  Congresswoman, good to see you this morning. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  You, of course, spent time in the many years working in the CIA, so you're well aware of [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=54.16s)]
*  these intelligence briefings, but also these intelligence assessments. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=59.48s)]
*  And that seems to be what is at the heart of this news conference we're going to have [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=62.879999999999995s)]
*  at the Pentagon in a short time, where there's going to be, with perhaps some pressure from [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=66.47999999999999s)]
*  the White House, an effort there to explain just exactly what happened, what was destroyed [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=71.52s)]
*  there in Iran. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=77.08s)]
*  But walk us through this procedure here. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=78.28s)]
*  Just how difficult is it to make these sort of assessments? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=80.12s)]
*  How are they done? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=83.52s)]
*  Well, as a former intelligence officer, I was a case officer with CIA. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=84.52s)]
*  And then when I was in Congress, I served on the Intelligence Committee. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=89.72s)]
*  I think it's important to know that intelligence that's available is always related to a certain [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=92.75999999999999s)]
*  point of time. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=97.8s)]
*  So it's always, you know, the intelligence community assesses such and such information [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=98.88s)]
*  as of such and such date. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=104.0s)]
*  And then typically the level of certainty that might exist, depending upon the sourcing, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=106.08s)]
*  depending upon how that information was collected, depending upon whether various entities within [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=110.44000000000001s)]
*  the intelligence community agree and to what degree of certainty. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=115.68s)]
*  And certainly from my time in Congress, I know that that was always the important question [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=120.76s)]
*  to ask. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  Like, what's the degree of certainty? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  How do agencies across the intelligence community agree or disagree? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=128.28s)]
*  Where might there be differences among their assessments? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=133.36s)]
*  Because all of that matters in knowing you could never really know with 100 percent certainty [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=136.84s)]
*  that's the nature of intelligence. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=141.72s)]
*  Yeah, no question there, especially in a place that's so difficult to reach, like this mountain [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=143.28s)]
*  site in particular in Iran. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=149.68s)]
*  Congressman, talk to us about the idea of the War Powers Act, if you will, where a number [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=151.68s)]
*  of your former Democratic colleagues are really, and to be fair, a few Republicans as well, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=157.07999999999998s)]
*  have really said, like, look, this unique congressional approval for this, the White [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=161.32s)]
*  House has, well, declined to agree. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=165.68s)]
*  Just talk to us about how important is this step? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  So as a former member of Congress, and certainly when I was in Congress, I focused on [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=172.44s)]
*  authorizations of use of military force. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=177.12s)]
*  I co-led multiple efforts to try and ensure that we were taking off the books, old, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=180.32s)]
*  outdated, but yet still open authorizations of use of military force, because we had found [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=186.04000000000002s)]
*  that between a sort of loose interpretation of the War Powers Act and a willingness to [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=191.56s)]
*  use outdated, old authorizations of use of military force, there's too much room for [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=196.88s)]
*  a president, Democrats and Republicans alike, to be able to move past what is Congress's [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=203.28s)]
*  constitutional authority to be the deciding factor in whether or not our nation goes to [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=208.72s)]
*  war. And certainly my expectation is that there will be significant oversight. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=214.44s)]
*  And I think that this is a priority, regardless of party, regardless of one's agreement with [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=220.76s)]
*  or disagreement with the president or the president's actions. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=228.35999999999999s)]
*  Congresswoman, before we turn to your race for governor, I just want to take a quick [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=231.56s)]
*  chance to ask you, given your background, do you think the president made the right [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=235.6s)]
*  call in taking this shot? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=239.6s)]
*  There is early polling suggesting that Americans across the board, Democrat, Republican, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=241.48s)]
*  are nervous about what's happened with these strikes. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=246.51999999999998s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=249.44s)]
*  I think as a again, as a former intelligence officer, I'm used to making assessments with a [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=251.76s)]
*  lot more information, most of it classified. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=256.59999999999997s)]
*  There is too much that I don't know to definitively say one way or another. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=259.12s)]
*  My expectation and what I hope they will ask about during the classified briefings would be what was [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=264.03999999999996s)]
*  known at what point in time, what was the goal, the stated goal of any particular military [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=268.96s)]
*  strike, what have been the outcomes, what are our next potential steps, how much did our [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=274.76s)]
*  partners and allies know or not know? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=280.48s)]
*  Because my concerns are really about what comes next. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=283.36s)]
*  Any isolated action. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=286.84000000000003s)]
*  Iran is a state sponsor of terror. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=288.76s)]
*  Iran has long been a national security risk to the United States, to Israel, to stability in [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=290.72s)]
*  the Middle East. And we also must be have a kind of clear-eyed view of what could be the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=296.12s)]
*  eventual possible outcomes of the strikes of last week. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=303.68s)]
*  OK, so as I mentioned, you're running for governor of Virginia. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=308.03999999999996s)]
*  It's shaping up to be one of the most closely watched races this year, and it is seen as a key [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=310.4s)]
*  test for the Democratic Party as it tries to rebuild in President Trump's second term. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=314.76s)]
*  And you're currently in the middle of a major bus tour across the state, visiting more than 40 [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=320.23999999999995s)]
*  cities. Good for you. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=326.67999999999995s)]
*  I was wondering what you're hearing as you travel across Virginia. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=328.28s)]
*  What are the issues? If you had to rank them, the top three issues among the Virginia voters at [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=331.56s)]
*  the moment? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=336.28s)]
*  Top issue, affordability. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=338.4s)]
*  Affordability in health care, in housing, in energy costs, particularly in some parts of the [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=340.08s)]
*  state. We here in Virginia, like so many places across the country, have seen real upticks in our [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=346.4s)]
*  housing costs, lack of availability, and that impacts every community, our most population dense [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=352.91999999999996s)]
*  as well as our most rural. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=358.15999999999997s)]
*  So affordability, the cost of living, that's number one. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=359.91999999999996s)]
*  Number two is education and the possibility that exists for our children, the strength of our [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=363.16s)]
*  public schools and what opportunities exist as they continue through those public schools and [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=369.12s)]
*  often to career or off to college. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=374.32s)]
*  And then the third is a general level of uneasiness, in part because of so much of the chaos [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=376.72s)]
*  coming out of Washington, whether it's the upheaval, certainly that impacts so many Virginians. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=382.36s)]
*  We have more than 320,000 Virginians who have chosen a career of public service within the [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=387.64s)]
*  federal government. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=394.8s)]
*  And certainly so many of them have lost jobs or their jobs have been under threat. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=396.32s)]
*  We have significant, felt significant impacts of the trade wars that this president has started, as [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=400.6s)]
*  well as in a state where so much of our economy is really surrounding agriculture, number one, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=407.56s)]
*  private industry. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=414.56s)]
*  Conservation dollars have stopped flowing because Washington has pulled that money back. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=415.68s)]
*  Research dollars to our public universities, much of that has been pulled back. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=421.12s)]
*  The economic uneasiness and just the divisive, angry rhetoric coming out of Washington is kind of [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=425.28000000000003s)]
*  the landscape issue that I hear about in every corner of Virginia. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=432.36s)]
*  So, Congressman, you mentioned affordability as being top of the list there of concerns your [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=436.64s)]
*  constituents have. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=441.4s)]
*  The same can be said for New York City and the mayor's race we just saw there with a real [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=443.0s)]
*  progressive socialist capturing the party's nomination. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=449.2s)]
*  Republicans have sort of rejoiced at that. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=454.59999999999997s)]
*  He is obviously far to your left on a number of issues. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=456.71999999999997s)]
*  Are there things are you concerned that you'll be painted with that same brush, that sort of [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=460.12s)]
*  liberal socialist out of touch brush? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=464.96s)]
*  Or do you think there's room for all these views in the party? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=466.52s)]
*  So I do not pretend to know anything about New York City politics or the outcomes of that election. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=469.59999999999997s)]
*  What I know is my state, the Commonwealth of Virginia, a diverse, a vibrant, a large state where we [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=475.88s)]
*  have prosperous Northern Virginia communities that are building, building, building and growing, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=483.59999999999997s)]
*  growing, growing. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=489.91999999999996s)]
*  We have beautiful farmland throughout the valley. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=490.59999999999997s)]
*  We've got older communities that are kind of changing and growing that used to be in industries that [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=494.36s)]
*  we've lost. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=503.52000000000004s)]
*  And now those communities are working towards a rebirth. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=504.16s)]
*  We've got the largest naval base in the world. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=508.2s)]
*  We're leaning into renewable energy. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=511.24s)]
*  Virginia is a really exciting place. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=513.5600000000001s)]
*  And we are facing challenges that I don't think are unique just to us as it relates to housing [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=516.76s)]
*  affordability. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=522.4s)]
*  But I certainly recognize that as the candidate for governor, as I have been hearing about these [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=523.1999999999999s)]
*  issues from people across Virginia since I first started my campaign back at the end of 2023, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiGRSErvvoA&t=527.68s)]
