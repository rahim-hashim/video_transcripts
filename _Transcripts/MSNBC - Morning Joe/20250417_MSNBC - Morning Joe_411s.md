# 'I want to stay in business': Small business owner pleads with Trump to reconsider tariffs
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8)
*  We've discussed the real world impact of President Trump's tariffs on small businesses. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=0.0s)]
*  Co-founder, CEO of the Fashion House Lafayette 148, Deirdre Quinn. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  Thank you for coming on the show this morning. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=10.68s)]
*  Andrew First, what do you make about the comments to Jerome Powell, what the Fed chair is actually [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=12.6s)]
*  saying? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=18.48s)]
*  And then talk about tariffs impact on small businesses. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=19.48s)]
*  So, well, you have, I mean, first of all, I don't think we have seen a president publicly [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=22.16s)]
*  take the gloves off this way, as explicitly. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=27.52s)]
*  Yes, he did this during the campaign, but the idea that he's doing this now as the president, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=30.48s)]
*  that's not to say that there have been presidents in the past that have privately said things [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=35.8s)]
*  and done things to try to influence the Federal Reserve, but this is about as in plain sight [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=39.84s)]
*  as you've ever seen. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=47.72s)]
*  The question is, can he jawbone and pressure Jay Powell to lower interest rates? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  Of course, Jay Powell has been out there saying that he doesn't think he can because he thinks [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  that there's a persistent possibility of more inflation. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=58.559999999999995s)]
*  Look, there is a fair debate to be had about that. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=62.48s)]
*  Having said that, I will tell you, I think that the folks on Wall Street right now have [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=65.44s)]
*  looked at, we've talked about this, that the bond market is the only thing governing Washington. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=70.16s)]
*  If you have a Republican House and a Republican Senate and you have a Republican in the White [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=76.32s)]
*  House, there is nobody else to quote unquote govern at all. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=81.60000000000001s)]
*  And right now, I think they look at the Federal Reserve as possibly one of those governors, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=85.24000000000001s)]
*  if you will, that's at least independent. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=89.36s)]
*  I imagine he will stay in that role, but the truth is he's out of that role no matter what [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=92.2s)]
*  in May of 26. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=97.04s)]
*  So there's going to become a conversation sometime probably in the fall, if not earlier, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=99.6s)]
*  where you will hear Trump talk about the kind of person who wants to put in that position. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  Is the market and the bond market going to say that's a puppet of Trump and therefore [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=109.56s)]
*  now there's no governor on this whole circumstance? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=114.52s)]
*  Or are they going to say that Jay Powell made a mistake and should have lowered interest [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=117.36s)]
*  rates? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=119.84s)]
*  And we will see what that debate looks like. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=120.84s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=122.36s)]
*  So, Mollye, you're going to help me with this and take us through the numbers here. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=123.36s)]
*  But at first, Deirdre, just tell us about your company, how long it's been in business, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=125.72s)]
*  and what is at stake in this moment? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=132.52s)]
*  Sure. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=134.84s)]
*  Lafayette 148, I found it 30 years ago in lower Manhattan, and we are a women's apparel [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=135.84s)]
*  luxury brand, and we manufacture in our own facility in China. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=142.12s)]
*  We're global. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=147.72s)]
*  We buy Italian fabrics. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=148.72s)]
*  It's New York design, and it is manufactured in our own facility. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=150.16s)]
*  And so these tariffs have been such a shock for us. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=154.6s)]
*  We went from $2 million to $33 million pretty much overnight. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=158.12s)]
*  Cost to you? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=163.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=164.52s)]
*  And there is no way you can stay in business with those types of tariffs. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=166.20000000000002s)]
*  And I am not prepared. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=169.8s)]
*  You know, we built a facility of artists to make our clothes, and I'm not prepared to [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=170.8s)]
*  lose my employees, my company. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=176.24s)]
*  So I'm here to fight before I'm a historian, a statistic. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=178.88s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=181.72s)]
*  How many employees do you have? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=182.72s)]
*  I have 300 in New York and around the country. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=183.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=187.4s)]
*  So let's talk through the tariffs for a minute. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=188.56s)]
*  So in 2019 to 2024, that was under Biden, it was a 7.5% tariff, right? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=191.32s)]
*  Correct. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=198.12s)]
*  So that, you know, it's not nothing, went to 10, went to 34%, went to 50%. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=199.12s)]
*  Somehow now it's 152.5%. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=207.04s)]
*  Correct. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=211.51999999999998s)]
*  It was 145 since February 4th, plus the original 7.5. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=213.4s)]
*  So it's 152.5. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=219.4s)]
*  If you make something, how a jacket, like the jacket you're wearing, what was the tariff [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=221.28s)]
*  under Biden and what is it now? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=228.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=229.88s)]
*  So if, for example, the jacket was $100, all right, it's now to bring it in $250, because [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=230.88s)]
*  you have to pay $150 on top of the $100. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=237.08s)]
*  So it's 150% tariff. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=240.36s)]
*  The tariffs cost more than the actual fabric and garment. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=242.32s)]
*  Andrew. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=245.6s)]
*  Here's a question that, look, the president and this administration think that they are [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=246.6s)]
*  going to somehow bring manufacturing back to the United States. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=250.4s)]
*  My worry is that actually, unfortunately, businesses like yours will go out of business [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=253.76000000000002s)]
*  before there's an opportunity to invest in doing that. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=256.84000000000003s)]
*  What would the cost of bringing that manufacturing back to the U.S. be if you could find some [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=260.32s)]
*  kind of transition? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=265.44s)]
*  I'm just curious to understand it. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=266.44s)]
*  We make our denim in L.A. L.A. is awesome at denim. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=268.24s)]
*  So it's not that I'm limiting what I'm doing. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=271.4s)]
*  We make our bags in Italy. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=273.32s)]
*  They make beautiful bags. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=274.76s)]
*  What we make in China is handmade double face. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=276.52s)]
*  We built a compound where you're making every single garment. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=280.78s)]
*  We're vertical. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=283.62s)]
*  The leather, the knit, the woven, the cashmere, the dresses, the blouses. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=284.62s)]
*  So you can't just, you know, I'd have to find 30 little factories. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=288.65999999999997s)]
*  My background is manufacturing. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=292.5s)]
*  I traveled to 70 countries in the world, went around 11 times in one year finding cheaper [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=294.26s)]
*  factories. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=299.29999999999995s)]
*  It's never cheap enough. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=300.29999999999995s)]
*  That's not what I'm looking for. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=301.29999999999995s)]
*  It's quality, not quantity. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=302.38s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=304.29999999999995s)]
*  So a big picture. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=305.29999999999995s)]
*  The tariff impact on Lafayette 148 jumping from under two million in 2019 to 2024 to [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=306.54s)]
*  over 30 million in 2025 alone. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=313.82s)]
*  First, yes or no? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=318.14000000000004s)]
*  Is this sustainable? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=319.3s)]
*  Absolutely impossible. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=320.78000000000003s)]
*  So to the Republicans who actually could vote and turn this around or even to President [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=322.18s)]
*  Trump, what do you say? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=326.82000000000005s)]
*  I say that this to me isn't about red or blue. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=328.58000000000004s)]
*  It's about red, white and blue. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=332.82000000000005s)]
*  I want to stay in business. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=334.90000000000003s)]
*  I am the version of an American dream. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=336.26000000000005s)]
*  My parents were immigrants. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=338.94000000000005s)]
*  My partners were immigrants. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=340.62s)]
*  We started to, we built the dream. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=342.62s)]
*  Don't take it away from us. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=345.02000000000004s)]
*  Please don't take it away from us. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=346.5s)]
*  Figure it out. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=348.18s)]
*  We're just business owners. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=349.18s)]
*  I represent entrepreneurs. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=350.18s)]
*  I represent small business owners. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=351.74s)]
*  I'm here to fight for the lives of our businesses before it's taken away. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=353.62s)]
*  It's just wrong. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=358.18s)]
*  Co-founder and CEO of the Fashion House, Lafayette 148. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=360.18s)]
*  Here, Dr. Quinn, thank you very much for putting a face on this story. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=364.14000000000004s)]
*  We've been talking about these tariffs for weeks now, but this is what the result is [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=368.66s)]
*  right here. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=374.14000000000004s)]
*  And again, you have a number of employees depending on the work that you may not be [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=375.14000000000004s)]
*  able to give them. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=379.74s)]
*  And all our thousands of customers that have been with us for 30 years that love our product [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=380.74s)]
*  and all one and over. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=385.5s)]
*  Are you going to be okay? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=386.5s)]
*  Well, I'm here to try to make sure we are. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuyK5KSwNP8&t=387.5s)]
