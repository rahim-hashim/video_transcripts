# ‘Bold, historic decision’: Israeli president reacts to U.S. airstrikes in Iran
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc)
*  Isaac Herzog toured the site of an Iranian missile impact in Tel Aviv yesterday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=0.0s)]
*  The damage to the residential infrastructure there was significant. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=5.0s)]
*  No one was killed. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=9.0s)]
*  Dozens, however, were injured. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=10.0s)]
*  And the Israeli president joins us now from Jerusalem. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=12.0s)]
*  President, thank you so much for being with us, Mr. President. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=15.0s)]
*  Let's start with, love to hear your reaction to the president's decision, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=18.0s)]
*  President Trump's decision to strike Iran over the weekend. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=23.0s)]
*  Thank you, Joe. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=28.0s)]
*  I commend President Trump for his decision. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=30.0s)]
*  It was a bold, historic decision. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=33.0s)]
*  It's a decision that sees the grand picture of the national security interests of the United States and of other nations. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=36.0s)]
*  Definitely, it is our national security interest as well. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=45.0s)]
*  But one has to understand this is a strike on the Iranian war machine that is lurking slowly but surely towards a nuclear bomb, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=49.0s)]
*  rushing quite quickly in the last few months, and is an imminent and clear threat to the free world. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=60.0s)]
*  And that is where President Trump has shown immense leadership in making it clear that this cannot go on, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=67.0s)]
*  that the Iranian war machine for the last decades and decades of spreading terror, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=74.0s)]
*  havoc, terror cells, killing civilians, developing huge missiles all the way to England, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=80.0s)]
*  and of course rushing to the bomb cannot go on. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=87.0s)]
*  And, Mr. President, obviously Israel and Tel Aviv have been under attack from Iran, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=91.0s)]
*  obviously most dramatically over the past 10 days, a few weeks, but it actually happened six months or so ago. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=98.0s)]
*  I'm curious, how is the Iron Dome holding up, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=108.0s)]
*  and do you fear that the attacks from Iran will only intensify after this weekend? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=115.0s)]
*  So look, we were bombarded and we are under barrages of attacks by Iranian missiles. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=122.0s)]
*  They're usually ballistic missiles, meaning quite heavy. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=129.0s)]
*  If they reach a target, they create quite a mess, unfortunately casualties. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=133.0s)]
*  In the last hour, we were told tragically that a 95-year-old Holocaust survivor, Ivette Smilovitch, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=139.0s)]
*  she was killed in one of those attacks and so are other Israelis as well. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=149.0s)]
*  However, all in all, I must say that the Israel air defense system has been quite incredible, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=154.0s)]
*  and our air force, parallel to that, is delineating, attacking, and removing further batteries of launchers in Iran. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=160.0s)]
*  So I visited all over the country, today I also visited the emergency services, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=169.0s)]
*  the Magent David Adom, as well as hospitals, and you see for yourself the immense damage, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=175.0s)]
*  but the great, great spirit of Israelis. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=181.0s)]
*  That's where we're at and that's why we shall overcome. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=184.0s)]
*  And if I had the choice between being there in an Iranian battery or being in an Israeli shelter [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=187.0s)]
*  or in the cockpit of a plane, the decision is very simple. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=194.0s)]
*  The Israelis will win, will overcome, and I thank the United States of America for boldly, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=200.0s)]
*  actively attacking the Iranian nuclear program because it's an octopus of immense danger to the free world. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=206.0s)]
*  So Mr. President, in the time we have left here, the U.S. has signaled this might be a sort of a one-off. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=214.0s)]
*  The President is not committed to further action. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=222.0s)]
*  If that is indeed the case and we don't quite know the level of damage suffered at these sites, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=224.0s)]
*  what more is Israel prepared to do to finish this program off? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=228.0s)]
*  So we're continuing our attacks, targeted attacks on their installations, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=232.0s)]
*  and it's a whole network of plants and equipment. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=239.0s)]
*  We're focused on that. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=244.0s)]
*  We believe that we have hit substantially on the Iranian nuclear capability and the missile capability [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=246.0s)]
*  because it's all connected. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=253.0s)]
*  And I think it's about time that the Iranian people and the Iranian regime understand [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=255.0s)]
*  that if they'll go on, it will get just simply worse and worse [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=260.0s)]
*  because Israel is controlling the skies of Iran these days. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=264.0s)]
*  All right, Israeli President Isaac Herzog, thank you so much for being with us today. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=268.0s)]
*  We greatly appreciate it. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=274.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=275.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd0576s68Mc&t=285.0s)]
