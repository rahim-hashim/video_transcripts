# 'Trump is on the edge' of making consequential decision on Iran: David Ignatius
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU)
*  And we'll get right started right now as Israel and Iran trade fire. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=0.0s)]
*  For the sixth straight day, President Trump is calling for Iran's, quote, unconditional [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=4.76s)]
*  surrender. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  He made the comment in a Truth Social Post yesterday, shortly after meeting with the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  National Security Council in the Situation Room. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=15.52s)]
*  The president claimed the U.S. knows exactly where Iran's supreme leader is hiding, writing, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=18.52s)]
*  quote, he is an easy target. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=25.36s)]
*  We are not going to take him out, at least not for now, but we don't want missiles shot [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=27.76s)]
*  at civilians or American soldiers. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=32.96s)]
*  Our patience is wearing thin. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  Videos posted on social media show huge lines of bumper-to-bumper traffic as people stream [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=39.400000000000006s)]
*  out of the Iranian capital this week. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=44.64s)]
*  There was also gridlock at gas stations. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=46.64s)]
*  Multiple current and former administration officials tell NBC News the president is now [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  considering a variety of options, including launching a possible strike on Iran. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=55.36s)]
*  This comes as Israel wants the United States to drop its largest bunker-busting bomb on [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=61.48s)]
*  a nuclear site that's deep underground. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=68.72s)]
*  A White House official tells NBC News the president has spoken with Israeli Prime Minister [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=72.32s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=77.16s)]
*  No other details were provided so far. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  It all comes as Israel's military says it struck a centrifuge production site in Tehran, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=82.32s)]
*  along with several weapons manufacturing facilities, part of the ongoing exchange of fire between [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=88.36s)]
*  Israel and Iran. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=94.32s)]
*  Missiles continue to be intercepted over Tel Aviv by Israel's Iron Dome defense system [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=96.6s)]
*  overnight. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=103.11999999999999s)]
*  The civilian death toll in Israel now stands at 24, according to officials there. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=104.11999999999999s)]
*  In Iran, strikes continued throughout the day and into the night, with a large explosion [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=110.0s)]
*  reported just before dawn today. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=116.26s)]
*  State media says at least 224 people have been killed since last Friday. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=118.72s)]
*  And as the two sides exchange fire, there are signs Iran is scaling back its attacks [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=126.2s)]
*  on Israel. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=132.44s)]
*  The New York Times reports it could be part strategy, part necessity. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=133.52s)]
*  While Israel's strikes have diminished Iran's ability to hit back, the Islamic Republic [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=138.4s)]
*  may also be making a deliberate shift toward lower-intensity attacks sustained over a longer [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=143.64000000000001s)]
*  period. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=150.96s)]
*  At the same time, Israel is reportedly running low on a key piece of weaponry that intercepts [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=151.96s)]
*  long-range ballistic missiles. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=157.84s)]
*  A U.S. official says the Pentagon has been aware of the capacity problems for months. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=160.28s)]
*  It raises concerns about Israel's ability to shield its population centers if the conflict [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=166.78s)]
*  isn't resolved soon. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=173.44s)]
*  David, yeah, I'm sorry. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=175.9s)]
*  That brings us all up to date. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=176.9s)]
*  Yeah, thank you for that. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=178.22s)]
*  And David Ignatius, I'm curious about your latest reporting. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=179.22s)]
*  And obviously, the one word, two-letter word that everybody focused on yesterday for good [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=182.82s)]
*  reason was the word we. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=189.1s)]
*  President Donald Trump talked about we have control over the skies of Iran, over Tehran. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=191.32s)]
*  What's your latest reporting? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=198.2s)]
*  Is the president moving towards bringing America into this war with Israel against Iran? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=200.12s)]
*  Joe, I think from the language coming out of the White House, what we know about the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=205.79999999999998s)]
*  meetings that are taking place, there's no question that President Trump is on the edge [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=209.98s)]
*  of making what would be a very consequential decision to use U.S. military force in this [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=214.76s)]
*  conflict. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=220.36s)]
*  This is not an in-and-out, one-and-done kind of intervention. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=221.52s)]
*  To join the war at this late date really does mean you're going to be involved in trying [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=228.10000000000002s)]
*  to obliterate the essence of the rule by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and, in a sense, share responsibility [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=232.9s)]
*  for what comes after. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=243.22000000000003s)]
*  From the beginning of this, Joe, there has been concern among U.S. officials that Israel [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=245.5s)]
*  can start a war against Iran, but it can't finish it without U.S. help. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=251.46s)]
*  That's something that bothered President Trump back in February when Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=257.22s)]
*  first began proposing the kinds of attacks that we've seen beginning last Friday. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=261.86s)]
*  And Trump was wary of being drawn into something that he wasn't sure was required. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=268.34s)]
*  He thought that maybe diplomacy could accomplish the same. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=275.1s)]
*  But this issue, that in the end there would be this deep, deep underground Iranian facility [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=278.02s)]
*  at Fordow, south of Tehran, that could only be taken out—Iranians keep many of their [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=284.14s)]
*  most sophisticated centrifuges—could only be taken out by a U.S. weapon, the so-called [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=291.32s)]
*  massive ordnance— [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=296.94s)]
*  Penetrator. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=299.94s)]
*  That penetrator would require American intervention. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=303.02s)]
*  And we're now on the edge of that, as I said at the beginning. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=307.42s)]
*  Trump seems still uncertain what he wants to do, how to make up his mind. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=310.78s)]
*  He should be uncertain. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=315.26s)]
*  It's a big, big choice, one of the most consequential of this presidency. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=316.26s)]
*  Well, and you know, Jonathan O'meer, you've obviously been reporting out of the White [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=319.54s)]
*  House over the past 24 hours about some of the divides inside Trump's own coalition, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=324.3s)]
*  and part of the reason there's a divide inside of Donald Trump's own coalition is there's [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=329.7s)]
*  been a divide, it seems, internally with Donald Trump over the past 20 years. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=333.34s)]
*  He's been talking for 20 years about how George W. Bush made a mistake going into Iraq. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=338.38s)]
*  It's one of the things he constantly talked about on the campaign trail. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=343.9s)]
*  And if somebody thinks that attacking Iraq and then dealing with the aftermath is difficult, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=348.18s)]
*  try Iran. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=355.09999999999997s)]
*  I mean, my God, that's not stating anything but the facts. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=356.3s)]
*  I mean, what an absolute, what an absolute complicated mess that would be. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=360.62s)]
*  Not just humanitarian, but strategic. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=369.70000000000005s)]
*  The warnings we've heard for years about the possibility of terrorism spawning off of that. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=372.94s)]
*  I'm curious, where is Donald Trump right now, and how does this line up with what he's been [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=378.1s)]
*  saying about the United States getting involved in Middle Eastern wars over the past 20 years, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=383.86s)]
*  and how he's always thought those wars were mistakes? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=389.62s)]
*  Yeah, it feels like so long ago, but one of the animating principles of his 2015-2016 [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=393.78000000000003s)]
*  campaign was to be sharply critical of these forever wars, Iraq and Afghanistan, and say [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=399.06s)]
*  he would not do the same, that he did not want further American intervention in the [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=404.5s)]
*  Middle East because of how inevitably messy and prolonged it would be. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=408.86s)]
*  He now seems to be on the brink of doing just that. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=412.94s)]
*  And right now, from people I've talked to inside the building and just outside close [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=415.98s)]
*  Trump allies, all the signs, all the momentum is pointing one way, which is the U.S. getting [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=419.66s)]
*  involved fully. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=424.3s)]
*  But that has not happened yet. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=425.3s)]
*  And we know that during President Trump's first term, both two separate times in 2019 [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=426.98s)]
*  and 2020, he was on the brink of real escalation, of using U.S. forces, U.S. weaponry on Iran, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=432.14s)]
*  and both times held back. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=438.5s)]
*  So there is a chance here he could again. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=440.28s)]
*  This could just be a negotiating tactic. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=442.22s)]
*  We know, as of a week ago, that was his hope, to bluster, to use the threat of American [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=445.22s)]
*  force to get Iran back to the negotiating table. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=450.1s)]
*  He does seem, though, in the events of the last week or so, being pushed along by Prime [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=454.74s)]
*  Minister Netanyahu, who has convinced him that Iran is close to a weapon. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=458.86s)]
*  Now I will say, U.S. intelligence does not agree with that assessment. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=463.90000000000003s)]
*  They do not believe that Iran is on the brink of that. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=469.3s)]
*  And Jeremy Bash, that is where we are right now. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=472.06s)]
*  And because if President Trump gives the go-ahead, if they do this, my understanding is, to use [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=475.56s)]
*  these bunker busting bombs, it's not just a B-2, it's not just an American bomb, it [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=480.7s)]
*  would need to be an American aircraft and an American pilot needed to deliver them, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=486.3s)]
*  which would mean this would be an American strike. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=491.42s)]
*  We'd be all in. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=494.14s)]
*  Walk us through this calculation. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=495.22s)]
*  So for the last 10 years or so, Jonathan, the U.S. and Israel have been discussing how [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=497.22s)]
*  to destroy, dismantle, degrade the underground enrichment facility at Fordow, outside of [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=501.24s)]
*  the city of Gom. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=507.54s)]
*  This is a deep buried underground facility with cascades spinning centrifuges that are [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=508.84000000000003s)]
*  enriching uranium, and that can be enriched to what the IAEA said last week was 60 percent, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=514.52s)]
*  which is approaching bomb-grade fuel. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=521.54s)]
*  Now that cascade hall is too small to power a civilian energy program for the Iranian [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=523.78s)]
*  people. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=530.14s)]
*  It is really a facility that's kind of tailor-made for a weapons program. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=531.14s)]
*  And the U.S. has had its eye on that facility for many years. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=536.1999999999999s)]
*  We've engaged in several operations, including sabotage operations, to go after it. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=539.66s)]
*  But of course, that facility still exists. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=545.12s)]
*  And you're right, Jonathan, the only way to access it would be through a B-2 stealth spirit [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=547.5s)]
*  bomber, which is based at a Whiteman Air Force base in Missouri. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBbFdWU-gU&t=552.0s)]
