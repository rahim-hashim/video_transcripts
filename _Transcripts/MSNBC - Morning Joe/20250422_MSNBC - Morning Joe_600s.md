# Hegseth rebuked by WSJ editorial board for 'validating the concerns of his critics'
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [April 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM)
*  Talk about this story with the Hegseth Signal Chat, the second one now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's bring in NBC News Senior National Security Correspondent Courtney Kuby. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=4.32s)]
*  Courtney, good morning. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=8.48s)]
*  What's the latest, the details first of all of what Hegseth actually did here? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=9.76s)]
*  Who he included in this group, what he shared, and is there pressure, if not from the President, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=14.4s)]
*  but internally at the Pentagon for something to change here? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I have to say, first off, it's really difficult to follow a conversation where [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=25.36s)]
*  you talk about Marty McFly and then talk about Signalgate 2.0. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=29.52s)]
*  But yeah, so yeah. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=32.48s)]
*  The look, the reality is, as we have, as Jonathan was mentioning here, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=35.36s)]
*  this is a whole nother story from what we all were talking about several weeks ago [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  with the chat that was that was reported on by the Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=45.2s)]
*  He was mistakenly added to why this is so much more important right now. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=48.8s)]
*  And why this is really turning a lot more heads, even than the first Signal Chat, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  is the fact that Secretary Hegseth himself created this chat. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=57.68s)]
*  And as you mentioned, he added some of his family members into it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=61.6s)]
*  The reality is, there is no reason that any of these individuals [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=66.0s)]
*  who have been identified, his wife, his brother, his attorney, his personal attorney, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=70.32s)]
*  would have any need to know about strikes and attack plans against the Houthi rebels. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=75.28s)]
*  Candidly, there are people in the Pentagon who are saying, look, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=80.88s)]
*  it just looks like he was bragging about what they were doing. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  And it came with the possibility of endangering the lives of the men and women [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=86.08s)]
*  who are flying those manned aircraft into a dangerous environment, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=90.08s)]
*  an area that the Houthis have shown they can contest. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=94.16s)]
*  They can contest the airspace. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=97.2s)]
*  And there were men and women, hundreds of them on ships afloat, not far. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=99.12s)]
*  In the initial salvo, remember, the U.S. military launched strikes from those ships, not only aircraft. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=103.68s)]
*  So the fact that he, the secretary himself, is the one who created this Signal Chat, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=109.2s)]
*  is why this is causing so much buzz around the Pentagon. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=114.24s)]
*  And it's for the reason that the secretary of defense is supposed to be the model [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=117.28s)]
*  for the young men and women in the military who are supposed to follow his behavior. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=122.56s)]
*  I was out on an aircraft carrier a little over a year ago when they were doing strikes [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=128.16s)]
*  against the Houthis. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=132.24s)]
*  And just to give you a sense of how sensitive they are about the information about these strikes, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=132.95999999999998s)]
*  about three or four days before the strikes began against the Houthis, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=138.88s)]
*  office aircraft carrier, the entire carrier, the entire ship goes into this mode. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=142.32s)]
*  I won't say the name of it, but they go into this mode where essentially no one is allowed [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=149.28s)]
*  to communicate with the outside. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=152.88s)]
*  They cut off all their communications. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=154.0s)]
*  You can't send a text home to mom and dad. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=155.84s)]
*  You can't send an email to your wife or your husband back home. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=158.23999999999998s)]
*  And that is because just the possibility that someone were to send a piece of information [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=161.51999999999998s)]
*  that could in any way endanger the mission is such a high priority to ensure that the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=166.48s)]
*  information is maintained, that they don't let those sailors communicate back home. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=172.4s)]
*  So the fact that now we have this fantastic reporting out of the New York, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=178.56s)]
*  initially by the New York Times and matched by a number of other agencies, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  that's why this is getting so much attention. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=185.76000000000002s)]
*  And as Jonathan mentioned, it also comes amidst this just utter chaos at the top, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=187.44s)]
*  at the Pentagon right now with, you know, a leak investigation that was announced by the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=193.52s)]
*  chief of staff, Joe Casper, several weeks ago. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=198.24s)]
*  And the first three people who were identified and actually escorted out of the building, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=200.88s)]
*  two of them are extremely close to Secretary Hegseth, people he's known for years, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=205.6s)]
*  worked with for years, they were in his inner circle. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=210.24s)]
*  They were escorted out of the building, and now they're all talking about how they have [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=212.64s)]
*  no idea why they were even fired. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=216.0s)]
*  So it's a level of uncertainty in the Pentagon that in my 20 years, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=218.96s)]
*  I've never seen anything like it, Willie. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=223.76s)]
*  All right, NBC's Courtney Kuby reporting for us from the Pentagon this morning. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=225.84s)]
*  Courtney, thanks so much. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=229.2s)]
*  You mentioned anyone who works in intelligence, works in the Defense Department. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=230.4s)]
*  Frankly, the layman viewer watching the show knows you don't put classified information [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=234.16s)]
*  into a public space like that. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=238.16s)]
*  Also, the senators who've jumped out, Republican senators, raced out to defend [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=240.48s)]
*  Pete Hegseth again on this round. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=244.72s)]
*  How embarrassing. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=246.64s)]
*  They all know better. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  And they were first in line on Hillary Clinton's private server. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=248.16s)]
*  I mean, how embarrassing for these GOP senators to know so much better about it. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=251.2s)]
*  And again, I would say Pete Hegseth knows better. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=254.96s)]
*  That's what's so surprising is somebody that fought in combat, that's somebody who [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=257.68s)]
*  understood the importance of, I mean, again, there are clips out there of him going after [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=260.8s)]
*  Hillary Clinton and the need to protect classified material. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=266.16s)]
*  This is not, listen, this is just not a close call. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=269.28000000000003s)]
*  And make, of course, the Wall Street Journal editorial page rightly concerned about this. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=273.28000000000003s)]
*  And they write an editorial today saying Pete Hegseth is proving all of his critics right. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=279.52000000000004s)]
*  He can blame it on the media if he wants to, but this is all his own fault. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=286.24s)]
*  And all he's doing is proving people like Mitch McConnell and others who said he wasn't [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=292.24s)]
*  ready for this job. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=297.12s)]
*  He wasn't up to this job yet, proving them right. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=298.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=301.6s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal editorial board writing what they call the Hegseth Pentagon [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=302.64s)]
*  Chronicles, reading in part, quote, no doubt the Beltway press would love to knock Pete [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=307.12s)]
*  Hegseth out as defense secretary. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=312.56s)]
*  But that doesn't come close to explaining the mess at the Pentagon. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=314.64s)]
*  The staff infighting dismissals and leaks over signal app chats look to be the self-inflicted [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=319.44s)]
*  mistakes of a management neophyte. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=326.47999999999996s)]
*  As GOP Senator Mitch McConnell warned in voting against Mr. Hegseth's confirmation, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=329.91999999999996s)]
*  The desire to be a change agent isn't a sufficient credential to run the giant Pentagon bureaucracy. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=336.64000000000004s)]
*  Mr. Hegseth's calling card is enforcing high standards and accountability at every military [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=346.0s)]
*  level. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=351.6s)]
*  He's relieved several general officers to make his point, sometimes firing indiscriminately [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=352.32s)]
*  without checking his scope. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=358.64000000000004s)]
*  Is the secretary accountable himself? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=360.96000000000004s)]
*  Let's bring in Roger's chair and the American presidency at Vanderbilt University, historian [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=364.23999999999995s)]
*  John Meacham. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=369.28s)]
*  And, John, again, this is unthinkable for any secretary of defense to do. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=370.0s)]
*  Unthinkable. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=378.0s)]
*  Just unthinkable that somebody would start their own chat and let civilians in on a pending [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=380.08s)]
*  strike. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=384.96s)]
*  And the Wall Street Journal editorial page, well, they ask a question that answers itself. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=385.35999999999996s)]
*  Let me ask you, can you imagine Bob Gates talking about a military strike on an app [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=392.24s)]
*  with friends and family? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=400.72s)]
*  You can fill in Bob Gates with any other sec def that has held that position in the, you [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=403.04s)]
*  know, over the past 100 years. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=412.32s)]
*  It just doesn't happen. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=414.48s)]
*  Well, I knew you wanted me to speak this morning about Henry Knox. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=417.76s)]
*  The first secretary of war. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=421.84s)]
*  Yes, of course. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=423.2s)]
*  Bing, bing, bing. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=424.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I thought that was... [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=424.96s)]
*  Again, if it's around the horn, we would give him as many points as we gave Pablo for [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=425.92s)]
*  saying Barabbas on Good Friday. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=430.4s)]
*  Go ahead, John. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=432.8s)]
*  So from Henry Knox to George Marshall to Bob Gates. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=435.44s)]
*  No, it's... [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=439.36s)]
*  I think Senator McConnell, I think the journal's right to go harken back to that. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=440.48s)]
*  Senator McConnell's vote was the right one. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=445.44s)]
*  These things feel as if, and I'm not in any way making light of it because these are military [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=447.36s)]
*  operations, these are soldiers' lives that are at stake, but it feels as if it's a fella [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=456.08s)]
*  who got a really exciting new job and wants to talk about it. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=462.96s)]
*  Yeah, he seems very, you know, sort of hyped up about acronyms and terms. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e3AlE6Z4xM&t=467.6s)]
